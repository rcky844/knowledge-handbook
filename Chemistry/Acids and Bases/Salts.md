**Salts** are [[Giant ionic structure|ionic compounds]] formed by a metal and a non-metal (e.g. $\ce{NaCl}$, $\ce{KNO3}$). <u>Some salts are soluble while some are insoluble.</u>

**Salts** are <span style="color: skyblue">electrolytes</span>, which is a compound consisting of <u>mobile ions to conduct electricity</u> only when it is <u>in molten or aqueous state</u>.

#### Formation of salts
- [[Reactivity of metals#Reactions with dilute acids (Ca - Pb)|Metal-acid reaction]]
- [[Neutralization]]
- Carbonate/hydrogencarbonate-acid reaction

> [!note]
> Carbonate/hydrogencarbonate-acid reaction is <u>not neutralization</u>.

#### Solubility of salts
**General rule**:
- Salts with $\ce{Na+}$ / $\ce{K+}$ / $\ce{NH4+}$ ions are always soluble in water.
- Salts with $\ce{NO3-}$ / $\ce{HCO3-}$ ions are always soluble in water.
- Most salts with $\ce{CO3^2-}$ / $\ce{O^2-}$ / $\ce{OH-}$ ions are insoluble in water (e.g. $\ce{MgSO4}$).
- **Exception cases**: $\ce{BaSO4}$ / $\ce{CaSO4}$ / $\ce{PbSO4}$ / $\ce{Ag2SO4}$ / $\ce{PbCl2}$ / $\ce{AgCl}$

> [!note]
> - Insoluble $\ce{AgCl}$ is used in the [[acidified silver nitrate test]].
> - $\ce{CaSO4}$ is slightly soluble in water.
> - $\ce{Ba(OH)2}$ and $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$ (limewater) are slightly soluble in water. They can both be used for testing $\ce{CO2(g)}$ ([[Test for carbon dioxide gas]]).

#### Preparation of salts
*Main article: [[Preparation of salts]]*

Procedures for preparation of salts differ by the properties of the salt:
- **Insoluble salts** can be prepared by mixing water-soluble reactants (precipitation) and separation of precipitate through [[filtration]].
- **Soluble salts (except $\ce{Na+}$, $\ce{K+}$, $\ce{NH4+}$)** can be prepared by reaction of water-insoluble base / alkali / metal carbonate with acid to give the soluble salts. Crystals are obtained through [[crystallization]].
- **Soluble salts ($\ce{Na+}$, $\ce{K+}$, $\ce{NH4+}$)** can be prepared by reaction of acids and alkalis through titration.
