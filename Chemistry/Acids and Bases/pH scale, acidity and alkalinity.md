#### Calculations involving pH
$$
pH = -\log_{10}\ce{[H+(aq)]}
$$
- $p$ refers to $-\log$ → $pH$ refers to the power of hydrogen ions.
- $pH$ has no unit.

$$
\ce{[H+(aq)]} = 10^{-pH}
$$
- The unit is $\pu{mol dm-3 / M}$.

> **Note**:
> $\ce{[OH-(aq)]}$ cannot be used for this calculation.

#### pH and acid-base nature of solution
![[pH_scale.webp]]
The **pH scale** can be used to define whether a solution is acidic, neutral or alkaline only at 25°C. When the temperature is not 25°C, pH has no relationship with acidity and alkalinity.
- When $\ce{[H+(aq)]}$ increase, the pH value of the solution decreases.
- When $\ce{[H+(aq)]}$ decrease, the pH value of the solution increases.

| Solution | Conc. of $\ce{H+(aq), OH-(aq)}$ | pH value |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Acidic | $\ce{[H+(aq)] > [OH-(aq)]}$ | pH < 7 |
| Neutral | $\ce{[H+(aq)] = [OH-(aq)]}$ | pH = 7 |
| Basic | $\ce{[H+(aq)] < [OH-(aq)]}$ | pH > 7 |

> **Note**:
> The value of pH can be below 0 or above 14.

#### Determining pH value
1. **Universal indicator solution**
   It is a mixture of several indicators and changes colour gradually. The colour is compared to a standard pH colour chart.

2. **pH paper**
   Similar properties with universal indicator solution, but a paper version.

3. **pH meter / data-logger with pH sensor**
   Dip the electrode into the solution, an accurate pH value will be shown.
