**Neutralization** occurs when the right amounts of an acid and a base is mixed to react completely to <u>produce a salt and water only</u>.

#### Reactions
##### Reaction of acid and alkali
- **Equation**
  $\ce{NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) -> NaCl(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$
  $\ce{NH3(aq) + HCl(aq) -> NH4Cl(aq)}$

- **Ionic equation**
  $\ce{OH-(aq) + H+(aq) -> H2O(ℓ)}$

> [!note]
> $\ce{Na+(aq)}$ and $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ are spectator ions. They do not take part in the reaction.

##### Reaction of acid with insoluble base
- **Equation**
  $\ce{Mg(OH)2(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> MgCl2(aq) + 2H2O(ℓ)}$
  $\ce{MgO(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> MgCl2(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$

- **Ionic equation**
  $\ce{Mg(OH)2(s) + 2H+(aq) -> Mg^2+(aq) + 2H2O(ℓ)}$
  $\ce{MgO(s) + 2H+(aq) -> Mg^2+(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$

> [!note]
> Any insoluble bases needs to be written in an ionic equation, because they are not solutions with mobile ions.

#### Heat change
**Neutralization** is an <u>exothermic reaction</u>.

For a neutralization reaction involving strong acids and alkalis, the same reaction occurs:
$$
\ce{H+(aq) + OH-(aq) -> H2O(ℓ)}
$$
- The heat released is the same ($\pu{57 kJ}$) even when the reactants are different.

However, the heat change of neutralization involving weak acid or weak alkali will be different because <u>part of the energy is used for the ionization of weak acid / weak alkali</u>.

> [!note]
> The same mole of strong and weak acid requires the same mole of alkali to carry out complete neutralization.
> 
> The ionization process for weak acid / weak alkali is reversible, a decrease in $\ce{H+(aq)}$ during reaction causes the equilibrium position to shift to the product side, and the neutralization reaction goes to completion.

#### Change in temperature and electrical conductivity
Consider the neutralization reaction:
$$
\ce{HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) -> NaCl(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}
$$


**Explaining change in temperature**:
![[neu_temp_change.webp|600]]

- The temperature <span style="color: lightgreen">increases</span> as the neutralization between $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ and $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ is <u>exothermic</u>.
- The temperature <span style="color: lightgreen">reaches the maximum</span> as the <u>neutralization has just completed</u>. <span style="color: skyblue">(equivalence point)</span>
- The temperature <span style="color: lightgreen">decreases</span> as the addition of excess $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ <u>cools down the reaction mixture</u>.

**Explaining change in electrical conductivity**:
![[neu_electrical_change.webp|550]]

- The electrical conductivity <span style="color: lightgreen">decreases</span> as the <u>concentration of mobile ions decreases</u> during neutralization.
- The electrical conductivity <span style="color: lightgreen">reaches the minimum</span> as the <u>neutralization has just completed</u>. <span style="color: skyblue">(equivalence point)</span>
- The electrical conductivity <span style="color: lightgreen">increases</span> as the addition of excess $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ increases the concentration of mobile ions in the reaction mixture.
