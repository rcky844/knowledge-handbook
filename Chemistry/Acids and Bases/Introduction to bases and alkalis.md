**Bases** react with acid to give <u>salt and water only</u> (neutralization).

**Alkalis** <u>dissociate / ionize / dissolve in water</u> to give $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ion as the only anion.

| Bases / Alkalis | Chemical formula | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sodium hydroxide | $\ce{NaOH}$ | - Stomach acid<br>- For cleaning |
| Ammonia | $\ce{NH3}$ | - As household glass cleaner |
| Calcium hydroxide / limewater | $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$ | - Used to neutralize the acidity in soil |
| Aluminium hydroxide / Magnesium hydroxide | $\ce{Al(OH)3, Mg(OH)2}$ | - As active ingredients in antacids and pills for stomach |

*Hazards of alkalis*:
- Concentrated alkalis are corrosive.
- Dilute alkalis are irritant.

*Reason for using hydroxides as antacids*:
Hydroxides will not produce $\ce{CO2(g)}$ with stomach acid, while carbonates does, which cause unwellness.

*Production of aqueous ammonia*:
- Aqueous ammonia is made by dissolving ammonia gas into water.
- Equation: $\ce{NH3(aq) + H2O(ℓ) <=> NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq)}$

*Miscellaneous characteristics*:
- Most dilute alkalis have a bitter taste.
- Dilute solutions of alkalis have a 'slippery' feel
- Dilute alkalis contain mobile ions to conduct electricity.

# Reactions of alkalis
## With metal ions
### Precipitation
- Alkalis carry $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions to react with metal ions to form metal hydroxide.
- The precipitates formed are insoluble, except for hydroxide of $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{K+}$.

| Metal ion | Solid metal hydroxide | Colour of precipitate |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $\ce{Ca^2+(aq)}$ | $\ce{Ca(OH)2(s)}$ | White |
| $\ce{Mg^2+(aq)}$ | $\ce{Mg(OH)2(s)}$ | White |
| $\ce{Al^3+(aq)}$ | $\ce{Al(OH)3(s)}$ | White |
| $\ce{Pb^2+(aq)}$ | $\ce{Pb(OH)2(s)}$ | White |
| $\ce{Zn^2+(aq)}$ | $\ce{Zn(OH)2(s)}$ | White |
| $\ce{Fe^2+(aq)}$ | $\ce{Fe(OH)2(s)}$ | Dirty green |
| $\ce{Fe^3+(aq)}$ | $\ce{Fe(OH)3(s)}$ | Reddish brown |
| $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ | $\ce{Cu(OH)2(s)}$ | Pale blue |
| $\ce{Ag+(aq)}$ | $\ce{Ag2O(s)}$ | Dark brown |

> [!note]
> Only hydroxides of transition metals are coloured.

*Solubility of calcium hydroxide*:
- It is only slightly soluble in water.
- For $\ce{NH3(aq)}$, the amount of $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ionized from $\ce{NH(aq)}$ is low, it can only react with $\ce{Ca^2+}$ to form a small amount of $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$.
	- $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$  formed is in small amount and is slightly soluble in water, precipitate cannot be given out.

### Redissolution
*Addition of excess $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$*:
- **Redissolved metal ions**: $\ce{Pb^2+}$, $\ce{Zn^2+}$ $\ce{Al^3+}$
- **Final product**: $\ce{M(OH)4^?-}$ (? needs to be calculated)

*Addition of excess $\ce{NH3(aq)}$*:
- **Redissolved metal ions**: $\ce{Zn^2+}$ $\ce{Cu^2+}$, $\ce{Ag+}$
- **Final product**: $\ce{M(NH3)4^?-}$ (? needs to be calculated)

## With ammonium compounds
*Example*: $\ce{NH4Cl(aq), NH4NO3(aq)}$
- They are ammonium containing compounds, heating their solids or solutions with solid base liberates ammonia gas ($\ce{NH3(g)}$).
- **Equation**: $\ce{2NH4Cl(s) + Ca(OH)2(s) -> 2NH3(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) + CaCl2(s)}$

![[nh3_heat_oh.webp|550]]
- <span class="hi-green">Upward delivery</span> is used to collect ammonia gas as it has a <u>lower density than air</u>.
- The boiling tube is clamped sloping downwards to <u>prevent sucking back / flowing back of water</u> formed. Otherwise, the boiling tube will crack.

> [!note]
> Heating $\ce{NH4Cl(aq)}$ with addition of $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ also liberates $\ce{NH3(g)}$.
> ↪️ $\ce{NH4Cl(aq) + NaOH(aq) -> NH3(g) + H2O(ℓ) + NaCl(aq)}$

## Neutralization
**Neutralization** is a reaction between an alkali with an acid to form salt and water only.
↪️ $\ce{NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) -> NaCl(aq + H2O(ℓ)}$

> [!note]
> The reaction between an acid and a carbonate is not neutralization, as $\ce{CO2(g)}$ is produced.
> ↪️ $\ce{CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> CaCl2(aq) + H2O(ℓ) + CO2(g)}$

# Role of water
*Sodium hydroxide ($\ce{NaOH}$)*:
- It is an ionic compound and already contains ions but they are not mobile.
- It will ionize in water to give mobile ions.

*Ammonia ($\ce{NH3}$)*:
- It is a covalent compound.
- It will ionize to give ammonium and hydroxide ions.
