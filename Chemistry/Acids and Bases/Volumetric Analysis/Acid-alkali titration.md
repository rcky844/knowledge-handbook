#### Procedure
**Example**: You are provided a sample of $\pu{50.0 cm3}$ $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ solution. In order to find the concentration of the solution, volumetric analysis has to be carried out. You will titrate it with $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ as neutralization reaction can occur.

0. [[Cleaning of apparatus]]
	- Wash the [[Apparatus used in volumetric analysis|apparatus]] with distilled water first.
	- Then only rinse the burette and pipette again by using solution they are going to contain.

1. [[Procedure of dilution|Dilution]]
	- $\pu{25.0 cm3}$ of $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ sample is diluted to $\pu{250.0 cm3}$.
	- The solution will be poured into the beaker when it is going to be used.

2. [[Preparation of standard solution]]
	- Prepare a standard solution of $\pu{0.5 mol dm-3}$ $\ce{HCl(aq)}$.
	- Add the solution into the burette.

3. [[Withdrawal of diluted sample]]
	- Pour a certain volume (e.g. $\pu{100 cm3}$) of diluted sample of $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ from $\pu{250.0 cm3}$ volumetric flask into the beaker.
	- Transfer $\pu{25.0 cm3}$ of the diluted sample to the conical flask by using pipette.

4. [[Choice of suitable acid-base indicator|Addition of acid-base indicator]]
	- Add a few drops of methyl orange / phenophthalein into the conical flask.

5. [[Procedure of titration|Titration]]
   ![[salt_titration.webp|400]]
	- Run the standard solution from the burette to the conical flask until the end point is reached.
	- When needed, assist the titration by flushing distilled water to the wall of conical flasks.
	- Repeat the titration for several times (3-4 times) by repeating step 3 to 5.
