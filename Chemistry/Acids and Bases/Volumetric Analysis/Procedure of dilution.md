**Rough dilution**:
- Add a small amount of concentrated sample into a large amount of distilled water with stirring.

**Precise dilution** (needed for titration):

<u>Example</u>: Describe briefly how the $\pu{25.0 cm3}$ of $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ can be diluted to $\pu{250.0 cm3}$ with distilled water in the laboratory.
- Transfer $\pu{25.0 cm3}$ of $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ by using a <u>pipette</u> into a $\pu{250.0 cm3}$ <u>volumetric flask</u>.
- Add <u>distilled water</u> into the volumetric flask up to the (/ until the meniscus reaches) <u>graduation mark</u>.
- Stopper the flask and shake thoroughly.
