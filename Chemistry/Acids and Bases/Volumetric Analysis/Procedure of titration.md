**General procedures**:
- The solution is slowly ran from the burette until the colour change of the indicator at end point is observed.
- The titration experiment has to be <u>repeated for several times</u>.
- Distilled water can be used to flush the reactant added aside to go inside the conical flask in order to allow reaction.
- A white tile is placed under the conical flask in order to allow <u>easier observation of the colour change at the end point</u>.

#### Reading the meniscus
**Example**: HKDSE 2020 Paper 1A Q16
![[2020_1a_16.webp|700]]

**Principle**:
When reading the liquid level from the burette, the bottom of the meniscus is used as the volume.

**Solution**:
- **Final volume**: $\pu{27.40 cm3}$
- **Volume of reagent used**: $\pu{27.40 cm3 - 4.80 cm3 = 22.60 cm3}$
- **Answer**: C

#### Calculating average volume of titrant
**Example**: HKDSE 2021 Paper 1B Q7(c)
The table below shows the results of the titrations:

| | Trial | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Final burette reading / $\pu{cm3}$ | 30.85 | 28.75 | 28.30 | 31.35 | 27.25 |
| Initial burette reading / $\pu{cm3}$ | 2.00 | 1.50 | 1.00 | 3.00 | 0.00 |

Calculate a reasonable average for the volume of the hydrochloric acid used in the titrations.

---

**Principles**:
- <u>Do not take in the very first trial</u> and do not take in any trial with $\pm\pu{1.00 cm3}$.
- The average volume <u>must have 2 decimal places</u>, e.g $\pu{25.00 cm3}$.

**Solution**:
After discarding the third set of data, the reasonable average volume of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ used
$= (27.25 + 27.30 + 27.25) \div 3$
$= \pu{27.27 cm3}$

**Reason for performing the titration experiment for several times**:
- To allow <u>taking average</u> of data to <u>reduce error</u> / to provide <u>more reliable results</u>.
