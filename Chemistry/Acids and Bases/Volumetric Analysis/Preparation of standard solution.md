**Standard solution** is a solution with <u>(accurately) known concentration</u>.

The substances suitable for making a standard solution is called <u>primary standard</u>. The solid of the primary standard should have the following characteristics:
- It must be obtainable in very pure form.
- It must have a known chemical formula (e.g. $\ce{(COOH2)2.2H2O(s)}$).
- It should dissolve in water completely in room temperature.
- It must be stable and does not absorb moisture from the air.
- It should have a high molar mass to minimize the weighing error.

*Notes when using sodium hydroxide*:
- Solid $\ce{NaOH(s)}$ is no appropriate for preparing standard solution.
  <u>Explanation</u>: Solid $\ce{NaOH(s)}$ absorbs water in air / reacts with $\ce{CO2(g)}$ in air.

- <u>Standardization</u> has to be done before using $\ce{NaOH(s)}$ as standard solution.
  <u>Description</u>: Titration with other standard solution to find its latest concentration.

*Procedure*:
1. Dissolve the solid sample by distilled water in a beaker.
2. Transfer the solution <u>with rinsing</u> to $\pu{250.0 cm3}$ volumetric flask.
3. Add distilled water to the flask until the graduation mark is reached.
4. Stopper and shake thoroughly.
