**Standard solution** is a solution with <span class="hi-green">(accurately) known concentration</span>.

# Primary standard
**Primary standard** are the substances used for making a standard solution.

*Properties of solid primary standards*:
- It must be obtainable in very pure form.
- It must have a known chemical formula (e.g. $\ce{(COOH2)2.2H2O(s)}$).
- It should dissolve in water completely in room temperature.
- It must be stable and does not absorb moisture from the air.
- It should have a high molar mass to minimize the weighing error.

*Notes when using sodium hydroxide*:
- Solid $\ce{NaOH(s)}$ is no appropriate for preparing standard solution.
  **Explanation**: Solid $\ce{NaOH(s)}$ absorbs water in air / reacts with $\ce{CO2(g)}$ in air.

- <span class="hi-blue">Standardization</span> has to be done before using $\ce{NaOH(s)}$ as standard solution.
  **Description**: Titration with other standard solution to find its latest concentration.

# Procedure
1. Dissolve the solid sample with distilled water in a beaker.
2. Transfer the solution <span class="hi-green">with rinsing</span> to $\pu{250.0 cm3}$ volumetric flask.
3. Add distilled water to the flask until the graduation mark is reached.
4. Stopper and shake thoroughly.
