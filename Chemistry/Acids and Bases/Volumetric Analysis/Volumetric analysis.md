**Volumetric analysis** is a method to determine the <u>concentration / amount of substance in a sample</u>.

A sufficient volume of a solution of <u>known concentration</u> is allowed to <u>completely react</u> with the substance being analyzed. The mole of concentration of the substance can be calculated from the experimental data.

**Titration** is a volumetric analysis technique using 'just sufficient' volume of reactant.
