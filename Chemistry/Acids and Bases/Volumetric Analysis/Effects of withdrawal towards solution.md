**Withdrawal** involves the removal of a specific volume of the solution, the mole of the substance would be different. However, the concentration of the substance remain unchanged.

#### Illustration
Consider $\pu{250.0 cm3}$ of $\pu{1.0 M}$ $\ce{HCl(aq)}$:

**Before withdrawal**:
- mole of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ = $1.0 \times {250.0\over1000}$ = $\pu{0.25 mol}$
- concentration of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ = $\pu{1.0 M}$

**Upon withdrawal**:
A $\pu{25.0 cm3}$ pipette is used to withdraw $\pu{25.0 cm3}$ of $\pu{1.0 M}$ $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ from $\pu{250.0 cm3}$ of $\pu{1.0 M}$ $\ce{HCl(aq)}$.

**After withdrawal**: 
- mole of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ → <span style="color: lightgreen">decreased</span>
  = $0.25 \times {25.0\over250.0}$ = $\pu{0.025 mol}$ ($\text{original mole} \times {\text{withdrawn volume}\over\text{original volume}}$)
- concentration of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ → <span style="color: lightgreen">unchanged</span>
  = $\pu{1.0 M}$
