**Titration curves** are used for describing the acid-base reaction process.

*Example*: Addition of $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ into $\ce{HCl(aq)}$
![[titration_curve.webp|480]]
- <span class="hi-blue">Equivalence point</span> is the moment when the acid and base <u>completely react</u>.

*Details of indicators*:
- The colour of the indicator can indicate the environment of the reaction mixture.
- <span class="hi-blue">End point</span> is the moment when the <u>indicator change its colour</u> (to a neutral colour).

*Limitation / Source of error*: <span class="hi-green">The end point is assumed to be the equivalence point.</span>
- The end point and the equivalence point usually occur at slightly different times during a titration.

*Titration curve of different experiments*:
![[acid_base_indicator_titration_curve.webp]]

*Principle for choosing an indicator*:
- The indicator needs to <u>change its colour within the pH range of the vertical part of the titration curve</u>.
- The <u>end point</u> of the indicator needs to be within the pH range of the<u>equivalence point</u>.

*Conclusion*:
- **Strong acid only**: Methyl orange
- **Strong alkali only**: Phenolphthalein
- **Strong acid and alkali**: Methyl orange or phenolphthalein
- **Weak acid and alkali**: No suitable indicator
  â†ª Use a method in [[pH scale, acidity and alkalinity#Determining pH value]]

*Reason for avoiding litmus solution*:
- It <span class="hi-green">does not give a sharp colour colour change</span> at the <span class="hi-blue">end point</span>.
- Litmus solution changes from red through purple to blue.
