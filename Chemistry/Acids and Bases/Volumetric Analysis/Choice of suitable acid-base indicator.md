**Titration curves** are used for describing the acid-base reaction process.

**Example**: Addition of $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ into $\ce{HCl(aq)}$
![[titration_curve.webp|480]]

- <span style="color: skyblue">Equivalence point</span> is the moment when the acid and base <u>completely react</u>.

**Details of indicators**:
- The colour of the indicator can indicate the environment of the reaction mixture.
- <span style="color: skyblue">End point</span> is the moment when the <u>indicator change its colour</u> (to a neutral colour).
- **Limitation**: The end point is assumed to be the equivalence point.
  The end point and the equivalence point usually occur at slightly different times during a titration.

**Titration curve of different experiments**:

**Principle for choosing an indicator**:
- The indicator needs to <u>change its colour within the pH range of the vertical part of the titration curve</u>.
- The <u>end point</u> of the indicator needs to be within the pH range of the<u>equivalence point</u>.

*Conclusion*:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Strong acid only</span>: Methyl orange
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Strong alkali only</span>: Phenolphthalein
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Strong acid and alkali</span>: Methyl orange or phenolphthalein
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Weak acid and alkali</span>: No suitable indicator

**Reason for avoiding litmus solution**:
- It <u>does not give a sharp colour colour change</u> at the <u>end point</u>.
- Litmus solution changes from red through purple to blue.
