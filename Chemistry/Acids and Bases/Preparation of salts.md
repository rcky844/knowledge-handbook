# Insoluble salts
**Insoluble salts** are prepared by mixing water-soluble reactants. As the salt is insoluble, it will be precipitated out. The precipitate (salt) is obtained by [[filtration]].

*Procedure* (to prepare $\ce{PbCl2(s)}$):
1. Mix $\ce{Pb(NO3)2(aq)}$ and $\ce{NaCl(aq)}$ solution. Precipitation of $\ce{PbCl2}$ occurs.
2. Filter the precipitate (salt) from the solution.
3. Wash the precipitate with small amounts of cold distilled water to remove any soluble impurities.
4. Dry the precipitate using filter paper / heating in oven / desiccator.

*Preparation of $\ce{CaSO4(s)}$*:
> [!warning]
> For preparation of $\ce{CaSO4(s)}$, do not use reactants that will result in the formation of a barrier for the reactants that prevent further reaction.

<u>Optimal reaction route</u>: $\ce{CaCO3(s) ->[HNO3(aq)] Ca(NO3)2(aq) ->[H2SO4(aq)] CaSO4(s)}$
- Add <u>excess</u> $\ce{CaCO3(s)}$ to <u>dilute</u> $\ce{HNO3(aq)}$. Filter to remove unreacted $\ce{CaCO3(s)}$.
- Add the filtrate to <u>excess dilute</u> $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ to form $\ce{CaSO4(s)}$ powder.
- <u>Filter</u> to obtain $\ce{CaSO4(s)}$ powder, wash with a small amount of cold distilled water and dry with <u>filter paper</u> / <u>desiccator</u> / heat in <u>oven</u>.

# Soluble salts (except $\ce{Na+}$, $\ce{K+}$, $\ce{NH4+}$)
**Soluble salts** that are not formed by $\ce{Na+}$, $\ce{K+}$, $\ce{NH4+}$ ions are prepared by reaction of water-insoluble base / alkali / metal carbonate with acid to give the soluble salts. The salt is then separated by [[crystallization]].

> [!note]
> - The reactants cannot both be solutions. One should be an insoluble base / metal / carbonate and one should be an acid.
> - In a laboratory setting, dilute acids / alkalis should be used for safety.

*Procedure* (to prepare $\ce{CuSO4(s)}$):
1. Add <u>excess</u> $\ce{CuO(s)}$ into dilute $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$.
   Heat can be provided to increase the rate of reaction.

> [!note]
> - Addition of excess $\ce{CuO(s)}$ ensures all $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$ has reacted (so that pure $\ce{CuSO4(s)}$ will be produced / no soluble impurities) (/ $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$ is the limiting reagent).
> - If $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$ is in excess, unreacted $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$ will contaminate $\ce{CuSO4(s)}$ obtained. $\ce{CuSO4(s)}$ will be impure.

2. Filter to remove excess $\ce{CuO(s)}$.
   The filtrate collected will be $\ce{CuSO4(aq)}$ solution. *(first filtration)*

3. Heat the $\ce{CuSO4(aq)}$ solution until it becomes <u>saturated</u>.

4. <u>Allow the heated saturated solution to cool down</u> in order to allow the gradual formation of crystals / [[crystallization]].

5. Filter to obtain the solid of $\ce{CuSO4.5H2O(s)}$ crystal as residue. *(second filtration)*

6. Wash the crystals with a <u>small amount of cold distilled water</u> to <u>remove any water-soluble impurities</u> on the crystal surface.

7. Dry the crystals using <u>filter paper</u> to obtain $\ce{CuSO4.5H2O(s)}$ (hydrated; blue in colour).
   Dry the crystal using <u>oven</u> to obtain $\ce{CuSO4(s)}$ (anhydrous; white in colour).

# Soluble salts ($\ce{Na+}$, $\ce{K+}$, $\ce{NH4+}$)
**Soluble salts** that are formed by $\ce{Na+}$, $\ce{K+}$, $\ce{NH4+}$ ions are prepared by reaction of acids and alkalis through titration.

*Reason for titration*:
- The compounds of $\ce{Na+}$, $\ce{K+}$, $\ce{NH4+}$ ions are soluble in water.
- It is not possible to determine when the complete neutralization of an acid and alkali occurs.
- Excess reactant will be added and contaminate the salt formed.

*Procedure* (to prepare $\ce{NaCl(s)}$):
![[salt_titration.webp|420]]

1. Place $\pu{25.0 cm3}$ of dilute $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ solution into a conical flask.
   Add a few drops of methyl orange / phenolphthalein to the flask.

2. Place dilute $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ solution in a <span class="hi-blue">burette</span>.
   Run the acid from the burette until the the colour of the indicator changes from yellow to orange / pink to very pale pink.
   Record the volume of acid needed for complete neutralization (end-point).

3. Repeat the experiment without the addition of the indicator.
   Mix the same volumes of acid and alkali together in a clean conical flask without indicator added.

4. Heat the reaction mixture until it is <u>saturated</u>.
   Cool the reaction mixture to allow the gradual formation of crystals / [[crystallization]].

5. <u>Filter</u> to obtain the crystal.

6. Wash the crystals with a <u>small amount of cold distilled water</u> to <u>remove any water-soluble impurities</u>.

7. Dry the crystal with <u>filter paper</u>.
