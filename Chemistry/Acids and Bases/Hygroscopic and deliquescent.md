**Hygroscopic** means a substance is able to absorb water from the air.
- **Examples**: anhydrous $\ce{CaCl2(s)}$, conc. $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$
- They are often used as <span style="color: lightgreen">drying agent</span> in desiccator.

- For the setup on the left, <u>the end of the delivery tube for incoming gas is put into the concentrated sulphuric acid</u>. This is to ensure that all the incoming gas can pass through the drying agent.
- The drying agent should not react with the material being dried (e.g. $\ce{NH3(g)}$).

**Deliquescent** means a substance which absorbs water from air to an extent which can dissolve itself to form a solution.
- **Examples**: $\ce{NaOH(s)}$, $\ce{KOH(s)}$
- They will <span style="color: lightgreen">not remain in solid state</span> stably, as they can absorb water vapour to become a concentrated solution (deliquescence).
