An **acid** ionizes in water to give hydrogen as the only cation.

| Acid | Chemical formula | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hydrochloric acid | $\ce{HCl}$ | - Stomach acid<br>- For cleaning |
| Sulphuric acid | $\ce{H2SO4}$ | - Used in lead-acid accumulator<br>- Used to make fertilizer |
| Nitric acid | $\ce{HNO3}$ | - Used to make fertilizer |
| Ethanoic acid | $\ce{CH3COOH}$ | - Found in vinegar<br>- Used in pickled food |
| Carbonic acid | $\ce{H2CO3}$ | - Found in soft drinks<br>- Found in rainwater |
> [!note]
> Other examples include citric acid and lactic acid.

**Hazards of acids**:
- Concentrated acids are corrosive.
- Dilute acids are irritant.

**Production of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$**:
By dissolving hydrogen chloride gas ($\ce{HCl(g)}$) into water.

**Miscellaneous characteristics**:
- Most dilute acids taste sour.
- Dilute acids contain mobile ions to conduct electricity.

#### Reactions
1. **With metals**
   Products: salt + hydrogen
   ↪️ Main article: [[Reactivity of metals]]

2. **With oxides / hydroxides**
   Products: salt + water

3. **With carbonates / hydrogencarbonates**
   Products: salt + carbon dioxide + water

> [!note]
> The reaction of acid and carbonates / hydrogencarbonates is [[Endothermic and exothermic reactions#Endothermic reaction|endothermic]].

#### Role of water
- An **acid** only exhibits its acidic property when water is present.
  They <u>cannot exhibit its acidic property when water is not present</u>.
- When an acid molecule dissolves in water, it will undergo <span style="color: skyblue">ionization</span> to form ions.

**Dissolving process of hydrogen chloride gas**:
![[dissolve_hcl.webp]]
- When $\ce{HCl(g)}$ dissolves in water, the number of mole of gas in the system decreases and the pressure decreases.
- An inverted funnel set-up is used in order to <span style="color: lightgreen">prevent suck back</span> of the solution.

> [!note]
> Hydromium ion $\ce{H3O+}$ is also formed when $\ce{H+}$ ions react with $\ce{H2O}$ by forming [[Covalent bonds#Dative covalent bonds|dative covalent bond]].
> - The number of $\ce{H3O+}$ ions is equal to the number of $\ce{H+}$ ions, so they are often ignored for simplicity.
> - $\ce{H3O+}$ ions also carry acidic property.

#### Basicity
**Basicity** is the maximum number of ionizable hydrogen atoms in an acid molecule.

| Basicity | Example |
| :--: | :--: |
| Monobasic | $\ce{HCl(aq), HNO3(aq), CH3COOH(aq)}$ |
| Dibasic | $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$ |
| Tribasic | $\ce{H3PO4(aq)}$ |
