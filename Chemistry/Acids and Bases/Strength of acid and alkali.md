The **strength of acid and alkali** depends on the <u>extent of ionization / dissociation</u> of the acid and alkali.

**For acids**:
- A **strong acid** <u>completely ionizes in water</u> to give hydrogen ion as the only cation. (e.g. $\ce{HCl}$ / $\ce{H2SO4}$ / $\ce{HNO3}$)
- A **weak acid** <u>partially ionizes in water</u> to give hydrogen ion as the only cation. (e.g. $\ce{CH3COOH}$ / organic acids)

**For alkalis**:
- A **strong alkali** <u>completely ionizes / dissociates in water</u> to give hydroxide ion as the only anion. (e.g. $\ce{NaOH}$ / $\ce{KOH}$)
- A **weak alkali** <u>partially ionizes / dissociates in water</u> to give hydroxide ion as the only anion. (e.g. $\ce{NH3}$ / amines)

> **Note**:
> Mobile molecules exist in the solutions of weak acids / alkalis.

#### Differences with concentration
The **concentration of acid or alkali** depends on the <u>amount of acid or alkali per unit volume of the solution</u>.

**Changing concentration**:
- Change the mole of the solute
- Change the volume of the solution

#### Relationship with concentration
![[acid_strength_conc.webp]]
- There is <u>no relationship</u> between the concentration and strength of an acid or alkali.

#### Deduction by pH calculation
*Pre-context: [[pH scale, acidity and alkalinity]]*

**Example**: HKDSE 2023 Paper 1B Q4
Tartronic acid is a diabsic acid. Under certain conditions, the pH of $\pu{0.102M}$ tartronic acid is 1.87. By calculation, show that tartronic acid is not completely ionized in water.

**Solution**:
- If tartronic acid is a strong acid / completely ionized,
  $\ce{[H+(aq)]} = \pu{0.102M \times 2} = \pu{0.204M}$,
  the pH will be $-\log 0.204 = 0.69$
- The actual pH is 1.87, which is higher than 0.69, it does not completely ionise in water.

#### Comparing strength with same concentration
**Example**: HKDSE 2015 Paper 1B Q5
Explain, with the aid of a chemical equation, why $\ce{NH3(aq)}$ is regarded as a weak alkali. Suggest how you would show that $\ce{NH3(aq)}$ is a weaker alkali than $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ through an experiment.

**Solution**:
- <u>Equation</u>: $\ce{NH3(aq) + H2O(â„“) <=> NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq)}$
- <u>Explanation</u>: $\ce{NH3(aq)}$ partially ionizes in water to give $\ce{H+(aq)}$ as the only cation, it is a weak acid
- <u>Fair comparison</u>: Prepare same concentration of $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ and $\ce{NH3(aq)}$
- <u>Method</u>: Measure their respective pH values using pH meter / electrical conductivity / temperature rise in neutralization / enthalpy change in neutralization
- <u>Observation</u>: $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ shows a lower pH value than $\ce{NH3(aq)}$ / higher electrical conductivity / higher temperature rise / higher enthalpy change in neutralization

#### Comparing strength with same pH value
> **Note**:
> - When they have the same pH value, they have the same $\ce{[H+(aq)]}$.
> - A weak acid reacts more slowly with an acid, but the products produced will be higher.

**Example**:
Suggest and explain how you would show that $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ is a stronger acid than $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ through an experiment if they have same pH value.

**Solution**:
<u>Explanation</u>:
For same pH (and volume),
- $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ has <u>more number of mole of / concentration of acid molecule</u> than $\ce{HCl(aq)}$
- $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ and $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ have same number of (mole of) / concentration of $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions. When reacting with $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$, $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ <u>further ionize</u> to give more $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ion (shift the equilibrium position for ionization)
- <u>Total number of (mole of)</u> $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ion ionized from $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ is <u>more</u> than that of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ when reacting with $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$
- $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ and $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ have <u>same concentration</u> of $\ce{H+(aq)}$. $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ is a strong acid which completely dissociates to give $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ion; while $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ is a weak acid which partially ionizes

<u>Fair comparison</u>: Prepare same volume of $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ and $\ce{HCl(aq)}$

<u>Method</u>:
- Titrate both acids against standard sodium hydroxide solution with phenolphthalein as indicators
- Add <u>excess</u> metal hydrogencarbonates (/ metal carbonates / reactive metals) and record the mass or volume of gas produced / mass of excess reactants remaining
- Temperature rise of neutralization with <u>limiting</u> $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$
- Enthalpy change of neutralization with $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$

<u>Observation</u>:
- $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ requires larger volume of (standard) $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ to reach the end point than $\ce{HCl(aq)}$.
- $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ produces a larger volume of gas than $\ce{HCl(aq)}$. / The mass of remaining excess reactant in reaction with $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ is lower.
- Enthalpy change of neutralization / Temperature rise in neutralization of $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ is lower than that of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$.

> **Note**:
> - For alkalis, it is also possible to add excess metal nitrates / metal sulphates / metal hydrogencarbonates that contains metal ion to form precipitate with $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ion and record the mass of precipitate.
> - Do not answer with pH / electrical conductivity / time required to finish the reaction / rate of reaction.
