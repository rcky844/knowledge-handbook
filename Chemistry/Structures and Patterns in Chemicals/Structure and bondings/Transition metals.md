- Outermost shell of the atoms of transition metals have either one or two electrons. Therefore, transition metals across a period have similar chemical properties.
- The next inner shell of atoms of transition metals is usually occupied but not full. Electrons can be removed from or added to this shell. Therefore, transition metals are different from most main group metals in many properties.
- Electrons in both the outermost shell and the next inner shell of most transition metal atoms contribute to the ‘sea of electron’. The strength of metallic bonds in transition metals is very strong.

#### Properties of transition metals
##### Formation of coloured compounds (in aqueous solution)
![[table_transition_metal_colours.webp]]

##### Variable oxidation states
Transition metals can exist in more than one oxidation state in their compounds.

**Examples**:
1. **Iron** ($\ce{Fe^2+ ⇌ Fe^3+}$)
   $\ce{Fe^2+(aq) + Cl2(aq) → 2Fe^3+(aq) + 2Cl-(aq)}$
   $\ce{2Fe^3+(aq) + Cu(s) → 2Fe^2+(aq) + Cu^2+(aq)}$

2. **Manganese**
	- **In acidic solution**
	  $\ce{2MnO4-(aq) + 5SO2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) → 2Mn^2+(aq) + 5SO4^2-(aq) + 4H+(aq)}$
	  ↪️ The solution turns from purple to very pale pink.

	- **In alkaline solution**
	  $\ce{2MnO4-(aq) + 3SO2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) → 2MnO2(s) + 3SO4^2-(aq) + 4H+(aq)}$
	  ↪️ Brown precipitate is formed due to the formation of manganese(IV) oxide.

##### Catalytic property
Transition metal ion usually forms an intermediate compound with one more of the reactants. The intermediate compound then participates in the formation of products. When the reaction is completed, the transition metal ion is regenerated.

**Examples**:
- **Haber process**
  $\ce{N2(g) + 3H2(g) <=>[\text{Finely divided }\ce{Fe(s)}][\text{400°C – 450°C, 200 atm}] NH3(g)}$

- **Contact process**
  $\ce{2SO2(g) + O2(g) <=>[V2O5(s)][\text{450°C – 600°C, 1 atm}] 2SO3(g)}$

- **Catalytic conversion in car exhausts**
  $\ce{2NO(g) + 2CO(g) <=>[\ce{Pt(s)}\text{ or }\ce{Rh(s)}][\text{High temperature}] N2(g) + 2CO2(g)}$

- **Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide**
  $\ce{2H2O2(aq) <=>[\ce{MnO2(s)}][\text{r.t.p.}] 2H2O(ℓ) + O2(g)}$

- **Ziegler-Natta polymerization**
  $\ce{n CH2 = CH2 <=>[\ce{Al(C2H5)3(s), TiCl4(s)}][100°C, 50 atm] [CH2 - CH2]_n}$

#### Applications of transition metals
- Vanadium is used in the manufacturing of steel, which is then used to make many tools.
- Chromium is used to coat the steel parts of a motor cycle.
- Cobalt-60 is used in radiotherapy.
