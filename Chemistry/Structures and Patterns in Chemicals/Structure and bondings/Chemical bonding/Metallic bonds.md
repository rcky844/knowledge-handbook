A **metallic bond** is the electrostatic force of attraction between metallic ions and a 'sea' of delocalized electrons. They exist in metals (metallic elements) only.

In metals, metallic atoms tend to lose their outermost shell electrons to become a positively charged ion. This process is called <u>ionization</u>.

The atoms of metals are closely packed together. The outermost shell electron of each atom continually moves from one atom to another. They are called delocalized electrons.

#### Reactivity of metals
> [!note]
> The information below is mostly exclusive to Group I and Group II metals.

- **The reactivity of the metals increases down the group.**
  Since the strength of metallic bond in the metals decreases down the group, the tendency of the metal to lose the outermost shell electrons increases down the group.

- **The reactivity of the metals decreases from Group I to Group II.**
  Since the strength of metallic bonds in the metals decreases from Group I to Group II, the tendency of the metal to lose the outermost shell electrons decreases from Group I to Group II.
