To compare the boiling point / melting point / states of A and B:
1. The structure of A and B must be stated.
2. The bond / force in A and B must be stated.
3. The particles (atoms / ions / molecules) in A and B must be stated.
4. The strength of bond / force in A and B must be compared.
5. For van der Waals' force comparison, reason must be stated (e.g. molecular size / polarity. Not accept molecular mass)

**Answer pattern**:
- A has a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ structure, while B has a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ structure.
- The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<u>bond / forces</u> between <u>atoms / ions / molecules</u> in A is <u>stronger</u> than the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_<u>bond / forces</u> in B (due to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_).
