Octet structure states that all atoms tend to attain the stable electronic configuration of a noble gas.

However, some molecules have less than or more than eight electrons in their outermost electron shell / do not have a stable octet electronic configuration.
↪️ They have a **non-octet structure**.

#### Reactivity
As they do not have a stable octet structure, they tend to obtain a stable octet structure by reacting with other chemicals.
