**Solubility** refers to the extent of a solute dissolving in a solvent. **Miscibility** refers to the extent of two or more liquids to mix well to become a mixture.

To determine whether a substance is soluble and miscible, we can compare them with the <span class="hi-blue">like-dissolve-like principle</span>.

# Like-dissolve-like principle
Substances will be <u>soluble in / miscible with substance with similar polarity</u>.
- Polar substance will be soluble in / miscible with substance with polar substance.
- Non-polar substance will be soluble in / miscible with substance with non-polar substance.

*Dissolving process*:
- Substances first undergo partial breaking of their intermolecular force / chemical bond.
- New intermolecular force / chemical bond is formed between the original substance and the newly added substance.

*Working principle*:
- If the attraction between the solutes and the attraction between the solvents are of comparable strengths, <u>breaking and reforming of attraction between solutes and solvents are facilitated</u>.
- Therefore, when the <u>attraction</u> between the solutes and the attraction between the solvents <u>are of comparable strengths</u>, the solutes tend to be soluble in the solvents.

*Strength of bonds and attractions*:
*See also: [[Relative strength of chemical bonds and intermolecular forces]]*
In general: [[ionic bonds]] â‰ˆ [[hydrogen bonds]] >> [[van der Waals' forces]]
- Ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds are of comparably strong strength as compared to van der Waals' forces.

# Predominant force
Molecules which can form hydrogen bond with water is not necessarily soluble in water.

![[c10h21oh.webp|500]]

Although the above molecule possess an $\ce{O-H}$ bond and can form [[hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bond]] with water, it is insoluble in water.
- The molecule has a large molecular size, the carbon parent chain is very long.
  (longer than $\ce{C4 - C6}$)
- The [[van der Waals' forces]] becomes predominant between molecules instead of hydrogen bonds.
