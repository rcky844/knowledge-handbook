**Hydrogen bonds** are a strong intermolecular force formed between a <u>hydrogen atom bonded to highly electronegative atom</u> (e.g. N / O / F) in a molecule and the <u>lone pair electrons from a highly electron negative atom</u> (e.g. N / O / F) in another molecule.

> **Note**:
> - Hydrogen bonds are directional in nature and van der Waalsâ€™ forces exist between molecules.

**Conditions for formation**:
1. The hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom (e.g. N / O / F).
2. There are lone pair electrons in the highly electronegative atoms (e.g. N / O / F).

**Examples of hydrogen bonds**:
- $\ce{NH3, H2O, HF}$
- [[Alkanol|Alcohol]]
- [[Alkanoic acid|Carboxylic acids]]

#### Strength of hydrogen bonds
1. **Average number of hydrogen bond formation per molecule** (more important)
   The more hydrogen bond a molecule can form <u>in average</u>, the stronger the hydrogen bond. (It can form more extensive hydrogen bonds.)

> **Note**:
> To find the average number of hydrogen bonds, find the maximum number of hydrogen bonds formed by a molecule The smaller number with respect to hydrogen atoms and lone pair electrons is the average number of hydrogen bonds.

2. **Polarity of bond** (less important)
   When the average number of hydrogen bonds is the same, consider the polarity of bonds. As electronegativity increases from N to O to F, the polarity of bond involving H atom: $\ce{N-H < O-H < F-H}$.
