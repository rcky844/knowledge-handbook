# Electronegativity
**Electronegativity** is the <u>ability</u> of the atom (of that element) to <span class="hi-green">attract bond pair electrons towards itself</span>.

*Trends in electronegativity on the Periodic table*:
- **Electronegativity increases from left to right across a period.**
  The <span class="hi-green">number of protons</span> in an atom of an element <u>increases</u> from left to right. The effective nuclear <u>charge</u> increases.

- **Electronegativity increases from bottom to top across a group.**
  The <u>number of occupied electron shells decreases</u> from bottom to the top. The <span class="hi-green">bond pair electrons can get closer</span> to the <span class="hi-blue">nucleus</span> of the atom of that element and it is more attracted.

- **Noble gases do not have electronegativities.**
  They usually do not form bonds with other atoms.

> [!note]
> Atoms of different elements could have the same electronegativities.

- The most electronegative elements are <span class="hi-blue">nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine</span>.

# Bond polarity
Consider the situations below:
![[cl-cl.webp|180]] $\ce{Cl-Cl}$ bond
- In this bond, there is no electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms.
- The electron cloud is evenly distributed / shared.
↪️ It is a <span class="hi-blue">non-polar bond</span>.

![[h-cl_dipole.webp|180]] $\ce{H-Cl}$ bond
- In this bond, there is electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms.
- The electron cloud is unevenly distributed / shared.
↪️ It is a <span class="hi-blue">polar bond</span>.

> [!note]
> The symbol underneath the $\ce{H-Cl}$ diagram can be used to indicate the dipole moments of the polar bond.

The <u>difference in electronegativities</u> between the two atoms of a covalent bonds results in polar bonds.

# Molecular polarity
> [!note]
> In diatomic molecules, the molecular polarity is also the bond polarity.
> 
> *Example*:
> ![[h-cl_dipole.webp|180]]

*Factors under consideration*:
1. **Presence of polar covalent bonds**
   The molecule must contain one of more polar bonds for it to be polar.

2. **Bond polarity symmetry**
   When polar bonds are <u>arranged symmetrically</u>, the molecule is <u>non-polar</u>.
   When polar bonds are <u>arranged asymmetrically</u>, the molecule is <u>polar</u>.

Consider $\ce{CHCl3}$ and $\ce{CCl4}$:
```tikz
\usepackage{chemfig}
\begin{document}
\chemfig{
  C
  ([::-45]<:Cl)
  ([:-90]<Cl)
  ([::-135]-Cl)
  ([:90]-H)
}
\qquad\qquad\qquad
\chemfig{
  C
  ([::-45]<:Cl)
  ([:-90]<Cl)
  ([::-135]-Cl)
  ([:90]-Cl)
}
\end{document}
```
- For $\ce{CHCl3}$, it has a tetrahedral structure. The dipole moments of the $\ce{C-H}$ and $\ce{C-Cl}$ bonds cannot exactly cancel out. Therefore, it is a polar molecule.
- For $\ce{CCl4}$, it has a tetrahedral structure. The dipole moments of the $\ce{C-Cl}$ bonds exactly cancel out. Therefore, it is a non-polar molecule.

> [!note]
> There is net dipole moment in the molecule of $\ce{CHCl3}$. It can be represented with the same symbols as in the case of bond polarity.

# Physical test for polarity of chemical species
![[polarity_test.webp|450]]
Physical test of <span class="hi-blue">liquid jet</span> can be used to determine whether a chemical species (liquid) is <span class="hi-green">polar</span>.

*Procedures*:
- A sample is added into a <span class="hi-blue">burette</span> and allowed to run.
- A charge rod is placed close to the liquid jet.

*Results*:
- If the liquid is polar, the liquid jet will be <span class="hi-orange">deflected towards</span> the charged rod.
- If the liquid is non-polar, deflection does not occur and the liquid jet keeps running as normal.

> [!tip] Polarity of charged rods
> A charged rod of either polarity (negative or positive) can be used, as the molecules can <span class="hi-green">rearrange / orientate</span> themselves to face the charged rod with a <span class="hi-orange">side of opposite charges</span> to the charged rod.

> [!info] Induced charges
> It is possible for some <span class="hi-green">non-polar</span> liquids to be deflected.
> 
> A charged rod induces an <span class="hi-blue">instantaneous dipole</span> in the molecule, so the molecules will face in alignment with the electric field of the charged rod.
