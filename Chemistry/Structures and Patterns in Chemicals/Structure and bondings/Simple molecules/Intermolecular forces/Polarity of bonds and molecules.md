#### Electronegativity
**Electronegativity** is the ability of the atom (of that element) to attract bond pair electrons towards itself.

On a [[periodic table]], several trends in electronegativity can be observed:
- **The electronegativity increases from left to right across a period.**
  The <u>number of protons in an atom of an element increases</u> from left to right. The effective nuclear <u>charge</u> increases.

- **The electronegativity increases from bottom to top across a group.**
  The <u>number of occupied electron shells decreases</u> from bottom to the top. The <u>bond pair electrons can get closer to the nucleus of the atom</u> of that element and it is more attracted.

- **Noble gases do not have electronegativities.**
  They usually do not form bonds with other atoms.

> **Note**:
> Atoms of different elements could have the same electronegativities.

- <u>The most electronegative elements are nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine.</u>

#### Bond polarity
Consider the situations below:
![[cl-cl.webp|180]] $\ce{Cl-Cl}$ bond
- In this bond, there is no electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms.
- The electron cloud is evenly distributed / shared.
↪️ It is a <u>non-polar bond</u>.

![[h-cl_dipole.webp|180]] $\ce{H-Cl}$ bond
- In this bond, there is electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms.
- The electron cloud is unevenly distributed / shared.
↪️ It is a <u>polar bond</u>.

> **Note**:
> The symbol underneath the $\ce{H-Cl}$ diagram can be used to indicate the dipole moments of the polar bond.

The <u>difference in electronegativities</u> between the two atoms of a covalent bonds results in polar bonds.

#### Molecular polarity
> **Note**:
> In diatomic molecules, the molecular polarity is also the bond polarity.
> 
> **Example**:

To deduce the polarity of a molecule, two factors are under consideration:
1. **Presence of polar covalent bonds**
   The molecule must contain one of more polar bonds for it to be polar.

2. **Bond polarity symmetry**
   When polar bonds are <u>arranged symmetrically</u>, the molecule is <u>non-polar</u>.
   When polar bonds are <u>arranged asymmetrically</u>, the molecule is <u>polar</u>.

Consider $\ce{CHCl3}$ and $\ce{CCl4}$:
![[chcl3.webp|180]] ![[ccl4.webp|180]]
- For $\ce{CHCl3}$, it has a tetrahedral structure. The dipole moments of the $\ce{C-H}$ and $\ce{C-Cl}$ bonds cannot exactly cancel out. Therefore, it is a polar molecule.
- For $\ce{CCl4}$, it has a tetrahedral structure. The dipole moments of the $\ce{C-Cl}$ bonds exactly cancel out. Therefore, it is a non-polar molecule.

> **Note**:
> There is net dipole moment in the molecule of $\ce{CHCl3}$. It can be represented with the same symbols as in the case of bond polarity.

#### Physical test for polarity of chemical species
![[polarity_test.webp|450]]
Physical test of <u>liquid jet</u> can be used to determine whether a chemical species (liquid) is polar.

**Procedures**:
- A sample is added into a burette and allowed to run.
- A charge rod is placed close to the liquid jet.

**Results**:
- <u>If the liquid is polar, deflection occurs and the liquid jet is brought closer to the charged rod.</u>
- If the liquid is non-polar, deflection does not occur and the liquid jet keeps running as normal.

> **Note**:
> A charged rod of either polarity (negative or positive) can be used as the molecules can rearrange themselves to face the charged rod with a side of opposite charges to the charged rod.
