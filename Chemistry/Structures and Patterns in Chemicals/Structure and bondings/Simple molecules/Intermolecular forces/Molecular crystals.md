#### Ice ($\ce{H2O}$)
##### Structure

##### Physical properties
###### Density
- In ice, water molecules are arranged in an orderly manner in an open structure because of the extensive hydrogen bonding between them.
- In this structure, water molecules are further apart than they are in liquid water. Thus, they make up a larger volume.
- When ice melts, water molecules have constant motion and the open structure collapses. The water molecules pack more closely together. This explains why liquid water is denser than ice.
