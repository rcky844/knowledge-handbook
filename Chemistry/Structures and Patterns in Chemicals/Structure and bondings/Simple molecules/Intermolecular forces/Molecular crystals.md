#### Ice ($\ce{H2O}$)
##### Structure
In ice, water molecules are arranged <span style="color: lightgreen">tetrahedrally</span> in an <span style="color: skyblue">open structure</span> because of the extensive [[Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]] between them. Water molecules are loosely packed and spaced further apart than they are in liquid water. Therefore, it has a relatively low density and makes up a larger volume.

> **Note**:
> The water molecules are held this way as hydrogen bonds are directional.

When ice melts, water molecules gain energy and have relative motion. The <u>open structure collapses</u>. Water molecules <u>pack more closely together</u>. Therefore, liquid water is denser than ice.
