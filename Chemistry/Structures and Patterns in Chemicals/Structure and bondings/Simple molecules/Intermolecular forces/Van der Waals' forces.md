**Van der Waals' forces** is a weak force that forms between molecules.

#### Formation of van der Waals' forces
##### Polar molecules
![[hcl_polar_vdw.webp|450]]
**Polar molecules** have permanent partial positive and partial negative charges, allowing them to be attracted to an end of another molecule by van der Waals’ forces (dipole-dipole forces).

##### Non-polar molecules
![[n2_vdw.webp|450]]
**Non-polar molecules** have no permanent partial positive and partial negative charges.

However, the random movements of electrons causes an uneven distribution of electrons in atoms of non-polar molecules. This causes the molecule to become polar (the atoms carry partial positive and partial negative charge) instantaneously.

This force is also know as dispersion forces / London forces.

#### Factors affecting the strength of van der Waals’ forces
1. **Molecular size**
   Molecules with larger molecular size has <u>greater contact surface area</u> with neighbouring molecules.
   The strength of van der Waals' forces between molecules of larger molecular size is stronger.

2. **Polarity of molecules**
   The strength of van der Waals' forces between polar molecules is stronger than those between non-polar molecules.

3. **Shape of molecules**
   When the molecule is <u>more linear</u> in shape (instead of bulky in shape, with many branched chains), the <u>contact surface area</u> between molecules becomes larger (they can pack more regularly). The strength of van der Waals' forces increase.
