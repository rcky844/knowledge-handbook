*Pre-context: [[Metallic bonds]]*

In metals, metal ions are packed together tightly in regular patterns to form a giant 3-dimensional structure (i.e. a lattice, crystalline structure), held together with <span style="color: skyblue">metallic bonding between metal ions</span> (e.g. $\ce{Na+}$) and <span style="color: skyblue">delocalized electrons</span> ($\ce{e-}$).

#### Appearance
Most metals have a shiny (metallic lustre) appearance.
- If they are reactive (e.g. [[Group I elements]] / [[Group II elements]]), they would tarnish in air easily.

#### Hardness
Metals are <span style="color: violet">malleable</span> and <span style="color: violet">ductile</span>.
- When force is applied to the metal, the <u>layers of metallic ions slide over each other, and the metallic bond reforms.</u>

#### Melting points and boiling points
Metals have <u>high</u> melting points and boiling points in general.
- To melt / boil metal, lots of heat energy is required to break the <u>metallic bond between metallic ions and a 'sea' of delocalized electrons</u>.

#### Electrical conductivity
Metals are <u>good electrical conductors</u> when they are in <u>solid or molten (liquid) state</u>.
- This is because metals consist of delocalized electrons.
- When electricity is passed through, the electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal in one direction to conduct electricity.

#### Heat conductivity
Metals are <u>good heat conductors</u>.
- When the terminal of a metal is heated, delocalized electrons collide with the neighbouring electrons, heat is transferred in the collision.

#### Solubility in aqueous and organic solvents
Most metals are insoluble in aqueous and organic solvents.
- The metallic bond in metal is much stronger than the intermolecular forces between water molecules in water / molecules in organic solvent. They are not of comparable strength.
- However, some reactive metals (e.g. $\ce{Na}$, $\ce{K}$) would chemically react with water, but this is not the metal dissolving.
