Atoms of most non-metals join together to form small molecules. The could either be elements or compounds.
- Within a molecule, covalent bond may exist to hold different atoms.
- Between different molecules, intermolecular forces (van der Waals' forces) exist to hold the discrete molecules.

# Hardness
For solid substances with simple molecular structure, they are usually soft as the intermolecular forces are weak.

# Melting points and boiling points
Most substances with simple molecular structure have <u>low melting points and boiling points</u>.
- To melt / boil them, less heat energy is required to break the van der Waals' forces between the molecules. (❌ covalent bond in the molecule)

# Solubility in aqueous and organic solvents
They are usually sightly soluble or insoluble in aqueous solvents.
- They are soluble in organic solvents as the strength of intermolcular forces (van der Waals' forces) between these molecules and that between the organic solvent molecules are of comparable strength.
- They are insoluble in aqueous solvents as the strength of intermoleuclar forces (van der Waals' forces) between these molecules and that betwee the water molecules (hydrogen bond) are not of comparable strength.

# Electrical conductivity
They usually do not conduct electricity since it does not consist of delocalized electrons or mobile ions.
