Acid-base properties of oxides of Period 3 ⤴️

> [!note]
> - $\ce{P4O10}$ is also called "Phosphorous(V) oxide" by its empirical formula of $\ce{P2O5}$. Phosphorous does not form ions with +5 charge, but it refers to the oxidation number of P in $\ce{P4O10}$.

#### Demonstrating their acid-base properties
To demonstrate their acid-base properties, add them to water or react with another substance (e.g. $\ce{HCl}$, $\ce{NaOH}$). Below lists some reactions that can be used for demonstrating these properties.

##### Sodium oxide ($\ce{Na2O}$)
- **Reaction with water (very vigorous)**
  $\ce{Na2O(s) + H2O(ℓ) → 2NaOH(aq)}$
  → $\ce{NaOH}$ is alkaline.

- **Reaction with acid**
  $\ce{Na2O(s) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$
  → The reaction is a neutralization reaction, producing salt and water only.

##### Aluminium oxide ($\ce{Al2O3}$)
$\ce{Al2O3}$ is <span style="color: skyblue">amphoteric</span>. It shows both acidic and basic properties.
- **Reaction with acid**
  $\ce{Al2O3(s) + 3H2SO4(aq) → Al2(SO4)3(aq) + 3H2O(ℓ)}$
  → The reaction is a neutralization reaction, producing salt and water only.

- **Reaction with alkali**
  $\ce{Al2O3(s) + NaOH(aq) + 3H2O(ℓ) → NaAl(OH)4(aq)}$
  → $\ce{NaAl(OH)4}$ is called sodium tetrahydroxoaluminate.

##### Sulphur dioxide ($\ce{SO2}$)
> [!note]
> $\ce{SO2}$ has double bonds in its structure, and the $\ce{S}$ atom is non-octet.

- **Reaction with water**
  $\ce{SO2(g) + H2O(ℓ) ⇌ H2SO3(aq)}$

- **Reaction with alkali**
  $\ce{SO2(g) + 2NaOH(aq) ⇌ Na2SO3(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$

##### Silicon dioxide ($\ce{SiO2}$)
> [!note]
> $\ce{SiO2}$ is insoluble in water. The compound alone is unable to exhibit acidic properties (pH of mixture of $\ce{SiO2}$ and water is 7).

- **Reaction with alkali**
  $\ce{SiO2(s) + 2NaOH(aq) ⇌ Na2SiO3(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$
  → The reaction is a neutralization reaction, producing salt (sodium silicate) and water only.

- **Ionic equation of neutralization**
  $\ce{SiO2(s) + 2OH-(aq) ⇌ SiO3^2-(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$
