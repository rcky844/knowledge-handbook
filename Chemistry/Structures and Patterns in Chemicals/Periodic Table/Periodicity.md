Variations in the nature of bonding and structure ⤴️

Across a period, elements on different groups show different bondings and structures. They can be used to explain the differences in physical properties of these elements.

#### Explaining variations in melting points
![[variations_melting_points.webp]]

1. **Gradual increase of melting point from Group I to Group III**
	- They have [[giant metallic structure]] and their atoms are held together by strong [[metallic bonds]].
	- Across the period, the number of electrons participating in metallic bond formation increases. The strength of metallic bonds increases.

2. **Abnormal increase of melting point of C and Si**
	- They have [[giant covalent structure]], their atoms are held together by strong [[covalent bonds]] in their structures.

3. **Low melting point from Group V to Group 0**
	- They have [[simple molecular structure]], their <u>discrete molecules</u> are held together by weak [[Intermolecular forces|van der Waals' forces]] only.

4. **Group 0 elements have the lowest melting point across the period**
	- They exist in the form of <u>monoatomic molecules</u>.
	- Their relative molecular masses are the lowest across the period.

#### Explaining variations in electrical conductivity
![[variations_electrical.webp|500]]

1. **Increase in electrical conductivity from Group I to Group III**
	- They are mostly metals and have [[giant metallic structure]].
	- Metals are good conductors of electricity as they have a lot of delocalised electrons in their structures.
	- Across the period, the number of electrons participating in metallic bond formation increases. Electrical conductivity increases.

2. **B, C and Si are electrical insulators**
	- They all have [[giant covalent structure]].
	- There is no delocalised electrons in their structure.

> [!note]
> Si and B are semi-conductors, they can conduct electricity at specific conditions (e.g. temperature).

3. **Elements of Group V to Group 0 are electrical insulators**
	- They are all non-metals with [[simple molecular structure]].
	- There is no delocalised electrons in their structure.
