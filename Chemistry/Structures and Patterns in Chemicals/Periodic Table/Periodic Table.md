- Horizontal rows in the Periodic Table are called <span class="hi-green">period</span>.
- Vertical columns in the Periodic Table called called <span class="hi-green">group</span>.

- The elements in the Periodic Table are arranged in the order of increasing atomic number.

# Groups
The group number of an element is equal to the number of <u>outermost shell electrons</u> in its atom.
- Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties as they have the same number of outermost shell electrons.
- Chemicals in the same group in the Periodic Table would show similar chemical properties. However, there is a gradual change of reactivity of the elements as we move down the group.

*List of specific groups*:
- [[Group I elements]]: alkali metals
- [[Group II elements]]: alkaline earth metals
- [[Group VII elements]]: halogens
- [[Group 0 elements]]: noble gases

# Periods
The atoms of elements in the same period have the same number of occupied electron shells.

Moving across the Periodic Table from left to right, some patterns can be observed.
- Elements change from metal to metalloid (semi-metal) to non-metal across a period.
- Melting points of elements of elements increase then decrease across a period.
↪️ These patterns are referred to as [[periodicity]].

# Duplet / octet rule
All noble gases are chemically inert and chemically stable as they have a fully occupied outermost shell electron shell.
- Main group elements tend to form compounds in such a way that each atom attained two / eight electrons in its outermost electron shell, giving it the same stable electronic configuration as a noble gas, and thus a stable octet structure.
