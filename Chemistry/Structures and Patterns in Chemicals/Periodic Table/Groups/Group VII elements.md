**Group VII elements** are <span style="color: violet">halogens</span>, all non-metals. They all have the same number of outermost shell electrons: 7.

#### Physical properties of the first four halogens
| Element  | State at r.t.p. | Colour of pure halogen | Colour in aqueous solution | Colour in organic solution |
| :------: | :-------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------: |
| Flourine |       gas       |      pale yellow       |             /              |             /              |
| Chlorine |       gas       |    greenish yellow     |        pale yellow         |        pale yellow         |
| Bromine  |     liquid      |         brown          |           brown            |           brown            |
|  Iodine  |      solid      |      dark purple       |           brown            |           purple           |

> **Note**:
> Halide ions are colourless.

#### Similarities of Group VII halogens
1. They are all toxic and smelly.
2. They are all non-metals.
3. They all react with metals to form compounds called salt.

#### Differences of Group VII halogens
> **Note**:
> The strength of van der Waals' forces between halogens molecules increases with the molecular mass.

1. There is a gradual change in state as we move down the group.
2. There is a gradual change in colour intensity down the group, from pale yellow to dark purple, becoming darker down the group.
3. There is a gradual change in melting and boiling points of the halogens.
4. The reactivity of halogens decreases down the group.

| Halogen | Reaction with hydrogen | Chemical equation |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Flourine | Reacts explosively even in darkness | $\ce{F2 (g) + H2 (g) -> 2HF (g)}$ |
| Chlorine | Reacts explosively in sunlight or when heated | $\ce{Cl2 (g) + H2 (g) -> 2HCl (g)}$ |
| Bromine | Reacts only when heated | $\ce{Br2 (â„“) + H2 (g) -> 2HBr (g)}$ |
| Iodine | Only partially reacts even when heated | $\ce{I2 (s) + H2 (g) -> 2HI (g)}$ |
