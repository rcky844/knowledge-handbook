> Hydrogen is not an alkali metal, as it behaves very differently compared to Group I alkali metals.

**Group I elements** are <span class="hi-blue">alkali metals</span>. They all have the same number of outermost shell electrons: 1.

# Similarities
1. They are all soft and can be cut with a knife. When they are freshly cut, they give a silvery (metallic) lustre but tarnish rapidly in air (due to reacting with oxygen in air).
2. They all have low densities (lower than water). Therefore, they would float on water (during reaction with water).
3. They are highly reactive, and must be stored in paraffin oil to prevent them from reacting with oxygen in air.
4. They all react vigorously with water to give $\ce{H2 (g)}$ and an alkaline solution.
   e.g. $\ce{2Na (s) + 2H2O (ℓ) -> 2NaOH (aq) + H2 (g)}$
5. They all react with certain non-metals to form compounds called salt.
   e.g. $\ce{2Na (s) + Cl2 (g) -> 2NaCl (s)}$

# Differences
- **The melting points and boiling points <u>decrease down the group</u>.**
  For metals, their melting points and boiling points depend on the strength of metallic bond in the metals. The stronger the metallic bond, the more heat energy is required to break the metallic bond so as to melt or boil the metals.

- **The reactivity <u>increases down the group</u>.**
  For metals, their reactivity depends on the tendency of that metal to loss the outermost shell electrons. The easier the metal to lose the outermost shell electron, the more reactive it is.

> [!tip]
> Strength of metallic bond decreases down the group as the the electron in the outermost shell is weakly bounded by nucleus.
