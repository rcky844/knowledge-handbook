**Group 0 elements** are <span class="hi-blue">noble gases</span>, all non-metals and gases. They all obey the [[Periodic Table#Duplet / octet rule|duplet / octet rule]] and <u>chemically inert and stable</u>.

> [!note]
> Helium has a duplet structure while other noble gases all have octet structures.

# Similarities
1. They are all colourless gases at room temperature and pressure.
2. They all have very low melting and boiling points.
3. They are all very unreactive due to extra stability created by duplet or octet structure.

# Differences
1. The melting and boiling points of noble gases increase down the group.

# Uses

| Gas | Use | Reason |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Helium | In balloons and airships | Low density and unreactive |
| Neon | In advertising signs | Glows red when an electric current is passed through it |
| Argon | Filling electric light bulbs | Does not react with the metal filament in a light bulb |
