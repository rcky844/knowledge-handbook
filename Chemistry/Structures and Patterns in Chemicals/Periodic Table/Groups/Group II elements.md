**Group II elements** are <span style="color: violet">alkaline earth metals</span>. They all have the same number of outermost shell electrons: 2.

#### Similarities of Group II alkaline earth metals
1. They are all soft and can be cut with a knife. When they are freshly cut, they give a silvery (metallic) lustre but tarnish rapidly in air (due to reacting with oxygen in air).
2. They are reactive metals, and must be stored in paraffin oil to prevent them from reacting with oxygen in air.
3. They all react vigorously with dilute acids to give hydrogen gas and a salt.
   e.g. $\ce{Mg (s) + 2HCl (aq) -> MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)}$
4. They all react with certain non-metals to form compounds called salt.
   e.g. $\ce{2Mg (s) + Cl2 (g) -> MgCl2 (s)}$

#### Differences of Group II alkaline earth metals
- **The melting points and boiling points <u>decrease down the group</u>.**
  For metals, their melting points and boiling points depend on the strength of metallic bond in the metals. The stronger the metallic bond, the more heat energy is required to break the metallic bond so as to melt or boil the metals.

- **The reactivity <u>increases down the group</u>.**
  For metals, their reactivity depends on the tendency of that metal to loss the outermost shell electrons. The easier the metal to lose the outermost shell electron, the more reactive it is.

> [!note]
> Strength of metallic bond decreases down the group as the the electron in the outermost shell is weakly bounded by nucleus.

> [!note]
> Compared to Group I alkali metals, Group II alkaline earth metals are less reactive and has higher melting points and boiling points. This is because the electron in the outermost shell is bounded by more and stronger metallic bonds.
