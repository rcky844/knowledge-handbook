The mass of an atoms is small. Instead of using conventional SI units (e.g. grams), the mass of every atom is compared to the mass of one proton or neutron. This is called relative mass, calculated based on comparison.

#### Relative isotopic mass
The relative mass of a certain isotope is called **relative isotopic mass**.

> **Definition**:
> The **relative isotopic mass** of a particular isotope of an element is the mass of one atom of the isotope compared with 1/12 of the mass of one carbon-12 atom.
- The mass of a proton and neutron can be calculated from carbon-12, which has a mass number of 12, with 6 protons and 6 neutrons.\

#### Relative atomic mass
> **Definition**:
> The **relative atomic mass** of an element is the weighed average relative isotopic mass of all naturally occurring isotopes of that element compared with 1/12 of the mass of one carbon-12 atom.

**Example #1**:
Magnesium has three isotopes, $^{24}\pu{Mg}$, $^{25}\pu{Mg}$ and $^{26}\pu{Mg}$. Under natural situation, they have the following relative abundances:

| Isotope | Relative isotopic mass | Relative abundance |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $^{24}\pu{Mg}$ | 24 | 80 |
| $^{26}\pu{Mg}$ | 26 | 10 |

Calculate the relative atomic mass of magnesium.

$24\times80\% + 26\times10\% + 25\times(100-80-10)\% = 24.3$

**Example #2**:
Silicon has three isotopes: $^{28}\pu{Si}$, $^{29}\pu{Si}$ and $^{30}\pu{Si}$. Given that the relative abundance of $^{28}\pu{Si}$ is $92.2\%$ and the relative atomic mass of Si is $28.1$, find the relative abundance of $^{30}\pu{Si}$.

$\text{Let }x\text{ be the relative abundance of }^{30}\pu{Si}.$
$28\times0.922 + 29(1 - 0.922 - x) + 30x = 28.1$
$x = 0.022$
$\therefore \text{}^{30}\pu{Si}\text{: }2.2\%$
