*Pre-context: [[Electrolysis of sea water]]*

**Chloroalkali industry** involves the production of $\ce{NaOH}$, $\ce{Cl2}$, $\ce{H2}$ by electrolysis of <span style="color: skyblue">brine</span> (conc. $\ce{NaCl}$ — feedstock).

> [!note]
> - In industrial production, sea water is not used as the feedstock directly, as it contains not only $\ce{NaCl}$, but also other dissolved minerals.
> - However, seawater can be purified to obtain conc. $\ce{NaCl}$ solution.

#### Working principle
![[electrolysis_brine.webp|300]]

**Cathode**:
- $\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{Na+}$ are attracted towards the cathode.
- $\ce{H+}$ is lower than $\ce{Na+}$ in E.C.S., $\ce{H+}$ are preferentially discharged to give $\ce{H2}$ gas.

**Anode**:
- $\ce{OH-}$ and $\ce{Cl-}$ are attracted towards the anode.
- Since $\ce{[Cl-(aq)]}$ is higher than $\ce{[OH-(aq)]}$, $\ce{Cl-}$ is preferentially discharged to give $\ce{Cl2}$ gas.

**Resulting electrolyte**:
- $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are preferentially discharged, the ions left will be $\ce{Na+(aq)}$ ions. The equilibrium position of self-ionization of water ($\ce{H2O(ℓ) <=> H+(aq) + OH-(aq)}$) will shift to the product side to produce more $\ce{H+(aq)}$ (together with $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions).
- $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ ions are preferentially discharged, the ions left will be $\ce{OH-(aq)}$.
↪️ Sodium hydroxide solution ($\ce{NaOH}$) is formed.

**Overall equation**:
$\ce{2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(ℓ) -> 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + Cl2(g)}$

##### Problems of traditional set-up
1. $\ce{H2(g)}$ and $\ce{Cl2(g)}$ would mix together, which is <span style="color: lightgreen">an explosive reaction under sunlight</span>.

2. $\ce{Cl2(g)}$ would <span style="color: lightgreen">dissolve in the electrolyte and react directly</span> with $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$.
	- $\ce{Cl2(g) + H2O(ℓ) <=> HOCl(aq) + HCl(aq)}$
	  The products would also react with $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ in the electrolyte, which makes the resulting electrolyte impure.

3. When $\ce{[Cl-(aq)]}$ < $\ce{[OH-(aq)]}$, $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ will be discharged to give $\ce{O2(g)}$ as one of the products and contaminates the $\ce{Cl2(g)}$ produced.

#### Flowing mercury cell
![[flowing_mercury_cell.webp|600]]

*Design* (advantages):
- **Production of $\ce{Cl2(g)}$ happens separately from $\ce{H2(g)}$.**
  This ensures no direct mixing of $\ce{Cl2(g)}$, $\ce{H2(g)}$ and $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$.

- **Reaction takes place in the cell with a sloping base.**
  This allows used brine to flow away so that $\ce{[Cl-(aq)]}$ > $\ce{[OH-(aq)]}$ and $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions will not be discharged to give $\ce{O2(g)}$.

- **The anode used is titanium or graphite.**
  They do not participate in the reaction and has high corrosion resistance.

> [!note]
> Platinum ($\ce{Pt}$) must not be used as the electrode, as $\ce{Cl2(g)}$ produced will attack the electrode.

*Limitations* (disadvantages):
- Mercury used is toxic.
- Unreactive sodium ion is discharged, it requires high energy to operate.

---

**At anode** (titanium or graphite):
- $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ has a higher conc. than $\ce{OH-(aq)}$, $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ ions are preferentially discharged to give $\ce{Cl2(g)}$.
- $\ce{2Cl-(aq) -> Cl2(g) + 2e-}$

**At cathode** (*mercury*):
- As mercury is used as cathode, it favours the discharge of $\ce{Na+(aq)}$.
- $\ce{Na+(aq)}$ is preferentially discharged to give $\ce{Na/Hg(ℓ)}$.
- $\ce{Na+(aq) + Hg(ℓ) + e- -> Na/Hg(ℓ)}$ (sodium amalgam)

**At the water tank**:
- $\ce{2Na/Hg(ℓ) + 2H2O(ℓ) -> 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + 2Hg(ℓ)}$
- Sodium amalgam reacts with water to give $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$, $\ce{H2(g)}$ and $\ce{Hg(ℓ)}$.

#### Membrane cell
**Membrane cell** is a more ideal cell compared to flowing mercury cell.

![[membrane_cell.webp|600]]

**Design** (advantages):
- **It uses a cation-permeable membrane.**
  The membrane only allows the passage of cations ($\ce{Na+, H+}$), but not anions ($\ce{Cl-, OH-}$), water ($\ce{H2O}$) and gas molecules ($\ce{Cl2, H2}$).

- **Flow of $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ from the anodic to cathodic compartment is prevented.**
  The cell produces sodium hydrogen of high purity.

- **There is no mixing of the reactants.**
  The substances obtained is highly pure.

---

**At anode** (titanium or graphite):
- As $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ has a higher conc. than $\ce{OH-(aq)}$, $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ ions are preferentially discharged to give $\ce{Cl2(g)}$.
- $\ce{2Cl-(aq) -> Cl2(g) + 2e-}$

**At cathode** (*nickel*):
<u>Neutral conditions</u>
- $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are discharged to give $\ce{H2(g)}$.
- $\ce{2H+(a) + 2e- -> H2(g)}$

<u>Presence of sodium ion</u>
- As $\ce{H+(aq)}$ has a lower E.C.S. position, $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are preferentially discharged to give $\ce{H2(g)}$.
- $\ce{2H+(aq) + 2e- -> H2(g)}$

<u>Solution becomes alkaline</u>
- The membrane is only permeable to cations but not anions.
- $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are discharged while $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions remain in the cathode compartment.
- $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions are continuously formed in the cathode compartment by self-ionization of water ($\ce{H2O(ℓ) <=> H+(aq) + OH-(aq)}$).
- $\ce{2H2O(ℓ) + 2e- -> H2(g) + 2OH-(aq)}$
