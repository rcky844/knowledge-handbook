#### Importance of methanol
**Example**: HKDSE 2012 Paper 2 Q1(b)(i)
Suggest why methanol is an important compound to chemical industry.
- Methanol is a 1-carbon containing compound which acts as a <span style="color: lightgreen">starting material</span> to produce carbon compounds with larger carbon number.

#### Methods for manufacturing
1. **Biomass conversion**
   Converting pig's manure to produce methanol.
	- **Advantage**: Renewable feedstock is used.
	- **Disadvantage**: Slow rate of reaction, product is impure and yield is low.

2. **Catalytic conversion of methane**
   Conversion of methane directly with the use of metal oxide catalyst at high temperature and pressure.
	- **Advantage**: Catalyst is used.
	- **Disadvantage**: High temperature is used which requires a lot of heat energy.

3. **Flue gas conversion**
   Converts carbon dioxide in flue gas to methanol
	- **Advantage**: Helps reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
	- **Disadvantage**: Collection of flue gas is difficult, may contain impurities.

4. **Microbial oxidation**
   Using microbial to oxidize methane to methanol.
	- **Advantage**: It has higher energy efficiency.
	- **Disadvantage**: Slow rate of reaction, product is impure and yield is low.

5. **Conversion by syngas**
   Through steam-methane reforming process.

##### Sources of methane

#### Conversion by syngas
##### Process
1. **Steam-methane reforming process**
   $\ce{CH4(g) + H2O(g) <=>[\text{700°C, 20 atm}][\ce{NiO}] CO(g) + 3H2(g)}$          $\pu{\Delta H = +206 kJ mol-1}$
	- Gas produced are <span style="color: skyblue">syngas</span>.

2. **Methanol manufacture**
   $\ce{CO(g) + 2H2(g) <=>[\text{250°C, 100 atm}][\ce{Cu / Al2O3 / ZnO}] CH3OH(g)}$          $\pu{\Delta H = -90 kJ mol-1}$

> [!note]
> - Methanol is flammable and toxic.
> - Methanol produced is in gaseous states due to the high temperature of the reaction system.

3. **Water-gas shift reaction**
   $\ce{CO2(g) + H2(g) <=> CO(g) + H2O(ℓ)}$          $\pu{\Delta H = +41 kJ mol-1}$
	- Excess $\ce{H2}$ is formed as volume ratio of $\ce{CO : H2}$ is $1:3$ in steam-methane reforming process but it is $1:2$ in methanol production.
	- This reaction can further increase the yield.

##### Working principle
![[steam_methane.webp]]

1. **Steam-methane reforming chamber**
	- Natural gas containing methane is first purified to remove sulphur impurity present.
	- Purification <u>prevents impurities from contaminating the iron catalyst</u>.

2. **Compression chamber**
	- The gas is compressed to the required pressure.

3. **Heat exchanger**
	- Heat is extracted from the hot product mixture in order to save energy. Outcoming gas also gets cooled down.

4. **Catalytic chamber**
	- It is where the reaction takes place.

5. **Condenser**
	- Crude methanol is liquefied and collected.
	- Unreacted syngas is recycled for another round of reaction.

6. **Distillation chamber**
	- Distillation of crude methanol product allows obtaining pure methanol.
