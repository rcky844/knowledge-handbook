**Ammonia** is produced by the direct combination of nitrogen and hydrogen.

**Equation**:
$\ce{N2(g) + 3H2(g) <=>[\text{450°C, 250 atm}][\text{finely divided }\ce{Fe(s)}] 2NH3(g)}$          $\pu{\Delta H = -92 kJ mol-1}$

**Source of nitrogen**:
- By [[Separation of different components of air|fractional distillation of liquefied air]]

**Source of hydrogen**:
- Electrolysis of brine (conc. $\ce{NaCl}$)
- [[Cracking]] of petroleum
- <span style="color: violet">Steam-methane reforming process + Water-gas shift reaction</span>
  ↪️ See also: [[Methanol manufacture]]
	 - $\ce{CH4(g) + H2O(g) <=>[\text{700°C, 20 atm}][\ce{NiO}] CO(g) + 3H2(g)}$          $\pu{\Delta H = +206 kJ mol-1}$
	 - $\ce{CO(g) + H2O(ℓ) <=> CO2(g) + H2(g)}$          $\pu{\Delta H = -41 kJ mol-1}$
	   ↪️ This is in reverse with the process in methanol manufacture.

#### Working principle
![[haber_process.webp]]

1. **Purifer and drier**
   $\ce{N2(g)}$ and $\ce{H2(g)}$ is mixed in the ratio of $1:3$ then purified and dried.
	- Purification <u>prevents impurities from contaminating the iron catalyst</u>.
	- Drying <u>prevents the formation of ice</u> which block the pipes.

2. **Compressor and heat exchanger**
	- As the Haber process is exothermic, the <u>hot gas coming out from catalytic chamber can help heat up the incoming gas</u>.
	- <u>Product and unused gases can be cooled down</u> simultaneously.
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">Saves heat and fuel.</span>

3. **Catalytic chamber**
	- It is where the reaction takes place.

4. **Condenser and storage tank**
	- Ammonia is liquefied by the condenser and collected in the storage tank.
	  ↪️ See also: HKDSE 2017 Paper 2 Q1(a)(i)(2)
	- Unreacted $\ce{N2}$ and $\ce{H2}$ are recycled and used to react again.

#### Operating conditions for Haber process
*Pre-context: [[Importance of industrial chemistry]]*

##### Temperature
Change in **temperature** affects <span style="color: lightgreen">rate of reaction and equilibrium position</span>.
- High temperature shifts the equilibrium position to the left and yield of $\ce{NH3(g)}$ will be decreased.
- Low temperature decreases the rate of reaction.

##### Pressure
Change in **pressure** affects <span style="color: lightgreen">equilibrium position</span>.
- High pressure shifts the equilibrium position to the right and increase the yield of $\ce{NH3(g)}$.
- However, this is limited by mechanical design. There is also safety concern (at pressure >10 atm) as this can cause explosion.

##### Others
**Example**: HKDSE 2012 Paper 2 Q1(a)(iv)
In Haber process, the product mixture is removed from the reaction chamber before reaching the yield of about 20%. Explain why this is so.
- It takes a long time for the equilibrium to be attained / to reach 20% product yield.
- It can increase the total amount of $\ce{NH3(g)}$ produced per unit time.

**Example**: HKDSE 2017 Paper 2 Q1(a)(i)(2)
Suggest how ammonia can be separated from the reaction mixture obtained.
- Cool to condense the reaction mixture to liquid.

#### Manufacture of nitrogenous fertilizer
##### Ostwald process
**Ostwald process** involves the <u>manufacture of nitric acid from ammonia</u>.
1. $\ce{4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) <=>[\text{900°C, 8 atm}][Pt] 4NO(g) + 6H2O(ℓ)}$     $\pu{\Delta H = -970 kJ mol-1}$
2. $\ce{2NO(g) + O2(g) -> 2NO2(g)}$     $\pu{\Delta H = -117 kJ mol-1}$
3. $\ce{4NO2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) + O2(g) -> 4HNO3(aq)}$     $\pu{\Delta H = -970 kJ mol-1}$

##### Production of ammonium salt (fertilizer)
**Reactions**:
- $\ce{NH3(aq) + HNO3(aq) -> NH4NO3(aq)}$
- $\ce{2NH3(aq) + H2SO4(aq) -> (NH4)2SO4(aq)}$
- $\ce{2NH3(aq) + CO2(g) -> (NH2)2CO(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$

→ The salt is then <u>purified and dried</u>.

> [!note]
> Ammonium salts are used as they contain the highest percentage by mass of nitrogen.
