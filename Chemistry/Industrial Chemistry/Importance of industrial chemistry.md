**Industrial chemistry** involves industrial processes to convert <span style="color: skyblue">feedstocks</span> (natural raw materials) to desired products.

To maximize profits, mass production of products would be needed. The reaction conditions should be maximized to achieve a <u>higher reaction rate</u> and <u>yield of products</u>.

#### Example: Vitamin C
**Vitamin C** (ascorbic acid) is an essential [[Vitamins|vitamin]] for the human body, and can prevent and treat scurvy. They can be found and extracted naturally in citrus fruits.
- The <span style="color: lightgreen">feedstock for vitamin C production</span> in industries is <span style="color: skyblue">glucose</span>.
- Even though they can be extracted naturally, they are still artificially synthesized. This is <u>to solve the issue of inadequate supply of vitamin C from natural sources</u>.

Vitamin C is manufactured by two main processes:
- Reichstein process
- Two-stage fermentation process
