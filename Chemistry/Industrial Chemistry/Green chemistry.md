**Green chemistry** is important for achieving sustainable development. It investigates ways to maximize the efficiency of utilization of feedstock, raw materials and energy, while reducing the emission of toxic substances and waste produced during the production process.

# Twelve principles of green chemistry
1. **Waste prevention**
   An industrial process is greener when no waste (side products other than products) is produced. <u>(Maximizes atom economy)</u>

2. **Using less hazardous chemical synthesis**
   An industrial process is greener when hazardous reactants are not involved.

3. **Using safer chemical products**
   Chemicals synthesized should be safe to use and not harm the environment.

4. **Using saver solvents and auxillaries**
   *Examples*: Replacement of VOCs and CFCs

5. **Designing for energy efficiency**
	- When a [[Catalysts|catalyst]] is used, less energy is needed to heat up the reaction mixture.
	- Energy is used to heat liquid mixture and purifying productions by <u>distillation</u>.
	- When the reaction pathway <u>consists of fewer steps</u>, less processes of separation and purification are needed. Less energy is needed.

6. **Using renewable raw materials / feedstock**
	- Reliance on petroleum-based raw materials is non-renewable.
	- Renewable raw products mostly come from agricultural products or crops.
	  *Example*: [[Importance of industrial chemistry|Production of vitamin C]], as glucose can be extracted from corn.

7. **Reducing derivatives**
   Additional reagents should be minimized.

8. **Using catalyst**
   [[Catalysts]] can speed up the reaction by providing an <u>alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy</u>. Less energy will be needed for synthesis.

> [!warning]
> Some catalysts are heavy [[transition metals]], they can cause harm to the environment when disposed of into rivers.

9. **Designing degradable products**
   *Example*: Biodegradable plastics

10. **Developing real-time analysis for pollution prevention**

11. **Minimizing the potential for chemical accidents**
    *Example*: leakages, explosions, fires

12. **Maximizing atom economy**
    Atom economy is based on the <u>100% conversion from reactants to products</u>.
    $\text{Atom economy} = {\text{mass of atoms in desired product} \over \text{total mass of atoms in the reactants used}} \times 100\%$

> [!warning]
> Do not mix up atom economy and percentage yield.
> - **Atom economy** does not involve experimentation, it is <u>based on a 100% completed reaction</u>.
> - **Percentage yield** is <u>based on experimental data</u>.

*Relationship of atom economy with percentage yield*:
Atom economy and percentage yield do not show any relationships.
- The calculation of atom economy is <u>based on a 100% complete reaction</u>.
- However, <u>most of the reactions do not go to completion</u>, and the yield is related to the <u>extent of reaction</u>.
