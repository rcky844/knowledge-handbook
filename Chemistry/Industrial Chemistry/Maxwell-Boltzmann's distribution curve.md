The **Maxwell-Boltzmann's distribution curve** is a curve showing the range of kinetic energies of the particles in a gaseous system at a particular temperature.

**Characteristics**:
- The x-axis is the <span style="color: skyblue">molecular kinetic energy</span>, the y-axis is the <span style="color: skyblue">number of particles</span>.
- The area under the curve represents the <span style="color: lightgreen">total number of particles in the system</span>.
- There are very few particles with high energies, and no particles with zero energy.
- There is no maximum energy for a particle.
- **Most probable kinetic energy**: The kinetic energy possessed by the largest number of particles.
- **Average kinetic energy**: Always lies on the <u>right of the maximum point</u>.

The shaded region under the curve shows the number of particles having energy equal or greater than the activation energy, which can collide effectively and undergo chemical reaction.

#### Change in temperature
**Effects** (increase):
- There is greater portion of high kinetic energy particles, distribution curve becomes flatter and lie to the right side.
- Most probable kinetic energy and average kinetic energy increase, while the number of particles having these kinetic energies decrease.
- Range of kinetic energy increases as higher kinetic energy can be achieved.
- Area under the curves are the same as the number of particles remain unchanged.
- Activation energy ($E_a$) remains unchanged.

**Explanation** (increase):
- An increase in temperature can increase the (average) kinetic energy of molecules.
- There is a larger portion of molecules having kinetic energy equal or greater than activation energy.
- The collision frequency and hence the effective collisions increase. Rate of reaction increases.

#### Catalyst
![[maxwell_boltzmann_catalyst.avif|450]]

**Explanation**:
- Catalyst increases the rate of reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with <u>lower activation energy</u>.
- More molecules will have energy equal or greater than $E_a$, effective collision increases.
