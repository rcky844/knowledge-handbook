Consider the reaction: $\ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD}$

**Rate equation**: $\ce{rate = k [A]^x [B]^y}$
where $k$ is the rate constant.

- Products are irrelevant to the rate equation.
- $k$ is the rate constant, and its value depends on the temperature of the reaction.
  ↪️ See also: [[Arrhenius equation]]
- $x$ and $y$ is the order of reaction for $\ce{A}$ and $\ce{B}$ respectively.

#### Order of reaction
##### 0<sup>th</sup> order
![[0order_cvt.avif|245]] ![[0order_rvc.avif|250]]
- <u>Rate of reaction does not depend on the concentration of reactants</u>, rate of reaction does not change even when the concentration increases.
- Concentration of reactants decreases at a constant rate.

##### 1<sup>st</sup> order
![[1order_cvt.avif|245]] ![[1order_rvc.avif|250]]
- <u>Rate of reaction depends on the concentration of reactants.</u>
- Concentration of reactants decreases from a higher rate to a lower rate.

##### 2<sup>nd</sup> order
![[2order_cvt.avif|245]] ![[2order_rvc.avif|250]]
- <u>Rate of reaction depends on the concentration of reactants.</u>
- Concentration of reactants decreases from a higher rate to a lower rate.
