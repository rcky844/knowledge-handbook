**Arrhenius equation** can be used to show the relationship between the rate constant and the activation energy.

**Effects of temperature on rate constant**:
Reaction rate increases when the temperature increases.
↪️ Rate constant increases.

#### Determination of $E_a$
The **Arrhenius equation** is usually used by taking $\pu{log}$ on both sides of the equation:
$\log k = \log A - {E_a\over 2.3R}({1\over T})$

##### Graphical method
Consider $\log k = \log A - {E_a\over 2.3R}({1\over T})$, it can be plotted into the following graph:

By $y=mx+c$:
- x-axis ($x$): $1\over T$
- y-axis ($y$): $\log k$
- slope ($m$): $-{E_a\over 2.3R}$
- constant ($c$): $\log A$

##### Mathematical method
To find the activation energy mathematically, the reactions have to be carried out under two different temperatures. Both equations are then combined together:

$\log({k_1 \over k_2}) = -{E_a\over2.3R}({1\over T_1}-{1\over T_2})$

**Example**:
Consider: $\ce{2N2O5(g) -> 2N2O4(g) + O2(g)}$
<table>
<tr>
<th>Temperature (K)</th>
<td>298</td>
<td>318</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Rate constant (s<sup>-1</sup>)</th>
<td>1.75 x 10<sup>-5</sup></td>
<td>5.00 x 10<sup>-5</sup></td>
</tr>
</table>

Determine the activation energy of the decomposition of $\ce{N2O5(g)}$.

$\log({1.75\times10^{-5}\over5.00\times10^{-5}}) = -{E_a\over2.3R}({1\over 298}-{1\over 318})$
$E_a = \pu{41.3 kJ mol-1}$
