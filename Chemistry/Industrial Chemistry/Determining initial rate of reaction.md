*Pre-context: [[Following the progress of a reaction]]*

Almost all of the rate equations are determined by using the initial concentration, as the initial concentration is accurately known.
↪️ The initial rate of reaction is found.

Initial rate can also be approximately calculated by measuring the time it takes for the reaction to produce a small amount of product. It is done through the following methods:
- Precipitation
- Colour change
- Change in absorbance

#### Precipitation ('Cross-blocking')
Consider the reaction:
$\ce{Na2S2O3(aq) + 2HCl(aq) -> 2NaCl(aq) + SO2(g) + H2O(ℓ) + S(s)}$
$\ce{S2O3^2-(aq) + 2H+(aq) -> SO2(g) + H2O(ℓ) + S(s)}$

Formation of creamy yellow precipitate of sulphur makes the solution <span style="color: lightgreen">turbid</span>, which <u>decreases the light transmittance</u> of the solution.

To measure the initial rate of reaction, the time for a small amount of sulphur to be produced which is enough to block the cross on the paper under the beaker is measured.

$\text{Initial rate} ∝ {1\over\text{Time to reach opaque stage}}$

##### Example

| Exp. no. | $\pu{1.0M}$<br>$\ce{HCl(aq)}$ | $\ce{H2O(ℓ)}$ | $\pu{0.04M}$<br>$\ce{Na2S2O3(aq)}$ | Time to reach opaque stage | Initial rate<br>($\ce{s^-1}$) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 1 | 10.0 | 20.0 | 10.0 | 83 | $0.0120$ |
| 2 | 10.0 | 10.0 | 20.0 | 42 | $0.0238$ |
| 3 | 10.0 | 0.0 | 30.0 | 28 | $0.0357$ |
- **Reason for same volume of the reaction mixture**
  To ensure fair comparison between trials.

- **Reason for different volume of water and $\ce{Na2S2O3}$ in different reaction mixture**
  To allow the concentration of $\ce{Na2S2O3(aq)}$ to be directly proportional to the volume of $\ce{Na2S2O3(aq)}$ used.

- **Reason to keep $\ce{[HCl(aq)]}$ much higher than $\ce{[Na2S2O3(aq)]}$**
  $\ce{[H+(aq)]}$ \>> $\ce{[S2O3^2-(aq)]}$
  $\ce{[H+(aq)]}$ remains constant, $\ce{[S2O3^2-(aq)]}$ is the only variable.

#### Colour change (Iodine clock reaction)
Iodine clock reaction is used to study the rate of reaction in cases where the reaction gives iodine ($\ce{I2}$) as products.

Consider the reaction:
$\ce{H2O2 (aq) + 2I- (aq) + 2H+ (aq) -> I2 (aq) + 2H2O (ℓ)}$
↪️ $\ce{I2 (aq)}$ can form a <span style="color: skyblue">dark blue complex</span> with starch.

**Description and explanation**:
- Add a small and fixed amount of $\ce{Na2S2O3(aq)}$ and starch solution at the beginning of reaction.
- The $\ce{I2 (aq)}$ produced will be consumed by $\ce{S2O3^2-(aq)}$ immediately.
- When all $\ce{S2O3^2-(aq)}$ is used up, any $\ce{I2 (aq)}$ produced will react with starch solution to form a dark-blue complex.
- Time $t$ can be found by measuring the time to reach the dark-blue complex.

**Reason for $\ce{S2O3^2-(aq)}$ solution is needed in a small and fixed amount**:
- Fixed amount ensures fair comparison.
- If a large amount is used, $\ce{I2(aq)}$ will be a limiting reagent, $\ce{S2O3^2-(aq)}$ cannot be used up, dark blue complex may not be produced. The rate of reaction is not equal to the initial rate.

#### Change in absorbance (colorimetry)
This is useful for measuring the concentration of coloured substance produced in a reaction, as the light absorbance of the solution is changed.
