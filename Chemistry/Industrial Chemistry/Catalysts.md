#### Characteristics
1. A **catalyst** is a substance which changes the rate of reaction with itself being <u>chemically unchanged</u> after the reaction.
	- Catalyst may undergo chemical change during reaction, but it must be regenerated after the reaction.

2. **Catalyst** increases the rate of reaction by <u>providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy</u>.

3. A **catalyst** is needed in a very small amount.

4. A **catalyst** is very specific in action.

5. A **catalyst** is easily poisoned by a small amount of impurities. The catalytic effect will be decreased once the catalyst is contaminated.
	- $\ce{Pt}$ catalyst in catalytic converter in motor cars is easily poisoned by lead compounds, leaded fuels cannot be used.

6. The **catalytic effect** will be <u>increased when the surface area of the catalyst is increased</u> (e.g. using porous / finely divided catalysts).
	- Increasing the surface area of a catalyst will increase the collision frequency between the catalyst and reactant particles.
	- The effective collision (per unit time) increases and the rate of reaction is increased.

7. The use of **catalyst** <u>doesn't change the enthalpy change</u> ($\ce{\Delta H}$) of the reaction.
	- The amount of total energy released / absorbed will be the same as that in uncatalysed reaction.
