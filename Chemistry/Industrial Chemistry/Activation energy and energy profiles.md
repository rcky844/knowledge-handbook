*Pre-context: [[Effective collisions]]*

**Activation energy** is the <u>minimum amount of energy possessed by the reactant particles in order for a reaction to occur</u>. It is the <u>energy barrier</u> that the reactant particles have to overcome before a reaction can occur.

#### Energy profile
![[energy_profile.avif]]

- **Activation energy must be positive.**
  Energy is needed to break bonds at the beginning of reaction.

- **Activated complex (or transitional state) is highly unstable.**
  It contains partially broken and partially formed bonds.

> **Note**:
> $\Delta H$ can be positive, zero or negative.

##### Catalyzed energy profile
**Definition of catalyst**:
Catalyst is a substance that can change the rate of reaction with itself being <u>chemically unchanged after the reaction</u>.

**Working principle of positive catalyst**:
- It increases the rate of reaction by providing an <u>alternative reaction pathway</u> with <u>lower activation energy</u>.
- More reactant particles have energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. The collision frequency and effective collisions increase.

##### Rate determining step (r.d.s.)
**Rate determining step** is the <u>slowest step of a chemical reaction</u> that determines the speed (rate) at which the overall reaction proceeds.

The slower step also have a <u>higher activation energy</u>.
