#### Basic definitions
- A **solute** is a substance to be dissolved by the solvent.
- A **solvent** is a substance to dissolve the solute.
- A **solution** is formed when the <u>solute dissolves in the solvent</u>.
↪️ solute + solvent → solution

- Substances that can dissolve in the solvent are **soluble**.
- Substances that cannot dissolve in the solvent are **insoluble**.

The substances in sea water (fish, sand and water) are useful, separation of these substances is important for different purposes.

Methods for separation:
- [[Separation of insoluble solid from a solution]]
- [[Obtaining soluble solid from a solution]]
- [[Obtaining solvent from a solution]]
- [[Electrolysis of sea water]]

#### Concentration of solutions
- A **saturated solution** is a solution that has <u>dissolved all the solute it can at a given temperature</u>. It can also be a concentrated solution, but may not necessarily be when the maximum degree of saturation at a given temperature is low (e.g. 10%).
- A **concentrated solution** is a solution that has <u>dissolved a relatively large percentage amount of solute</u>. It may not necessarily be a saturated solution and could possibly dissolve more solute at the same temperature.
