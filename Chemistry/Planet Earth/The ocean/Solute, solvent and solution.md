# Definitions
## Solutions
- A **solute** is a substance to be dissolved by the solvent.
- A **solvent** is a substance to dissolve the solute.
- A **solution** is formed when the <u>solute dissolves in the solvent</u>.
↪ solute + solvent → solution

## Solubility
- Substances that can dissolve in the solvent are **soluble**.
- Substances that cannot dissolve in the solvent are **insoluble**.

The substances in sea water (fish, sand and water) are useful, separation of these substances is important for different purposes.

## Solids
*Forms of dissolved solids*:
- **As a powder**: Very small in size with no water (completely anhydrous)
  e.g. $\ce{NaCl (s)}$
- **As a crystal**: Have regular shapes and may contain water inside
  e.g. $\ce{NaCl . nH2O (s)}$

# Methods for separation
- [[Decantation]]
- [[Filtration]]
- [[Evaporation]]
- [[Crystallization]]
- [[Simple distillation]]
- [[Electrolysis of sea water]]

# Concentration of solutions
- A **saturated solution** is a solution that has <span class="hi-green">dissolved all the solute it can at a given temperature</span>. It can also be a concentrated solution, but may not necessarily be when the maximum degree of saturation at a given temperature is low (e.g. 10%).
- A **concentrated solution** is a solution that has <span class="hi-green">dissolved a relatively large percentage amount of solute</span>. It may not necessarily be a saturated solution and could possibly dissolve more solute at the same temperature.
