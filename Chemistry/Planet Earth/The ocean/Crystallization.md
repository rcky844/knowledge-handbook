**Crystallization** is a <u>physical process</u> that involves incomplete [[evaporation]]. A solution is first heated until it is <u>saturated</u> and let to cool down for crystals to form. Crystals obtained via this method are highly pure, they can be classified as pure substances.

1. Heat the solution to remove some solvent by [[evaporation]] until the solution becomes <u>saturated</u>.

> [!tip] Test whether a solution is saturated
> - Dip a glass rod into the solution and take it out. The solution is saturated if solid forms on the rod when it cools down.
> - Add solute (e.g. salts) into the solution. The solution is saturated when the solute can no longer dissolve.

2. Allow cooling of the hot saturated solution. Crystallization will start as some solute can no longer dissolve in the solution.

> [!note]
> The solution can either be cooled rapidly or slowly. However:
> - **Rapid cooling** provides <u>less time</u> to allow the crystallizing solute to form larger crystals, which leads to the formation of <u>crumble crystals</u> instead.
> - **Slow cooling** provides <u>more time</u> to allow the crystallization solution to form <u>larger crystals</u>.

3. Separate the crystals formed using [[filtration]]. The crystals are collected as residue.
4. Wash the crystal with <u>small amount of cold distilled water</u> to wash away any <u>soluble impurities</u> on the crystal surface. Dry the crystal with a filter paper or desiccator.

> [!note]
> When crystals are dried in an oven, the high temperature causes the water inside the crystal to evaporate, leading the anhydrous salt in powdered form.
