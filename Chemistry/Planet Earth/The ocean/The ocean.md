**The ocean** contains sea water, which is a water solution consisting of 3.5% by mass of dissolved salts (e.g. NaCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The main solid dissolved is NaCl (common salt).

Some oceans or bodies of water have differing amounts of dissolved salts. For example, the sea water in the Dead Sea has an unusually high salt content (27%), enabling one to float effortlessly.
