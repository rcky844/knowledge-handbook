**The ocean** contains sea water, which is a water solution consisting of 3.5% by mass of dissolved salts (e.g. $\ce{NaCl}$, $\ce{MgCl2}$, $\ce{Na2SO4}$, $\ce{CaCl2}$). The main solid dissolved is $\ce{NaCl}$ (common salt).

Some oceans or bodies of water have differing amounts of dissolved salts. For example, the sea water in the Dead Sea has an unusually high salt content (27%), enabling one to float effortlessly.
