**Electrolysis of sea water** would pass electricity through sea water to rearrange the constituent elements to make other useful substances.

When electricity is passed through sea water, chemical reactions are forced to occur.
- Chlorine gas ($\ce{Cl2 (g)}$) is formed at the positive electrode.
- Hydrogen gas ($\ce{H2 (g)}$) is formed at the negative electrode.
- The solution in the set-up (sea water) becomes sodium hydroxide solution ($\ce{NaOH}$).
↪️ $\ce{sea water ->[electrolysis] hydrogen + chloride + sodium hydroxide}$

# Uses of products of electrolysis of sea water
## Hydrogen
- Hydrogenation of vegetable oil to form <span class="hi-blue">margarine</span>
- Produce <span class="hi-blue">hydrazine</span> used as rocket fuel
- Produce <span class="hi-blue">ammonia</span> to make fertilizer
- To make <span class="hi-blue">hydrochloric acid</span> with chlorine gas

## Chlorine
- To <span class="hi-green">sterilize</span> swimming pool and drinking water
- To make <span class="hi-blue">PVC</span>
- To make solvents (e.g. $\ce{CCl4}$)
- To make <span class="hi-blue">chlorine bleach</span> by dissolving in sodium hydroxide
  ↪️ $\ce{2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) → NaCl(aq) + NaClO(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$
- To make <span class="hi-blue">hydrochloric acid</span> with hydrogen gas

## Sodium hydroxide
- To make <span class="hi-blue">soap</span> ([[Detergents#Production of soap in laboratory]])
- Used as <span class="hi-blue">drain cleaners</span>
- To <span class="hi-blue">neutralise acidic waste water</span> from factories
