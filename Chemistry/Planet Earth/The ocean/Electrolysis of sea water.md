**Electrolysis of sea water** would pass electricity through sea water to rearrange the constituent elements to make other useful substances.

When electricity is passed through sea water, chemical reactions are forced to occur.
- Chlorine gas ($\ce{Cl2 (g)}$) is formed at the positive electrode.
- Hydrogen gas ($\ce{H2 (g)}$) is formed at the negative electrode.
- The solution in the set-up (sea water) becomes sodium hydroxide solution ($\ce{NaOH}$).
↪️ $\ce{sea water ->[electrolysis] hydrogen + chloride + sodium hydroxide}$

#### Uses of products of electrolysis of sea water
##### Hydrogen
- Hydrogenation of vegetable oil to <u>form margarine</u>
- <u>Produce hydrazine</u> used as rocket fuel
- <u>Produce ammonia</u> to make fertilizer
- To make <u>hydrochloric acid</u> with chlorine gas

##### Chlorine
- To <u>sterilize swimming pool and drinking water</u>
- To <u>make PVC / hydrochloric acid</u>
- To <u>make solvents</u> (e.g. $\ce{CCl4}$)
- To <u>make chlorine bleach</u> by dissolving in sodium hydroxide
- To make <u>hydrochloric acid</u> with hydrogen gas

##### Sodium hydroxide
- To <u>make soap</u>
- Used as <u>drain cleaners</u>
- To <u>neutralise acidic waste water</u> from factories
