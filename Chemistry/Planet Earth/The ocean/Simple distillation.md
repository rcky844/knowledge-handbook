**Simple distillation** is a <span class="hi-blue">physical process</span> which boils and evaporates the solvent, then condenses its vapour so that the pure solvent can be obtained.

> [!note]
> Sea water mainly consists of water and dissolved salts, but the dissolved salts have much higher boiling points than water. Water will boil and vaporize upon heating while the dissolved salt will not. Thus, simple distillation is needed to obtain the solvent itself.

*Procedures*:
1. The solution is <span class="hi-green">heated up slowly</span>. The solvent (water) will vaporize and rise the distillation flask when the temperature has reached its boiling point.
	- The dissolved solutes (e.g. $\ce{NaCl}$) has a much higher boiling point than water / is non-volatile, they will not vaporize easily.

2. Eventually, the <span class="hi-blue">distillate</span> will be collected at the end of the condenser in a conical flask / test tube.

*Underlying principles*:
- Water boils at 100°C while the salts do not.
- Water vapour condenses to liquid in the condenser.

# 'Quickfit' set-up
![[simple_distillation_quickfit.webp|550]]
- The <span class="hi-blue">condenser</span> will be connected to the distillation flash. It provides a lower temperature to condense water vapour.
	- Cold tap water is kept flowing in the outer layer of the condenser, while the inner layer would condense the water vapour that reaches the top of the distillation flask.
	- Cooling water <span class="hi-green">enters at the lower end</span> to increase the effectiveness of cooling.
- The <span class="hi-blue">anti-bumping granules</span> is to ensure <span class="hi-green">even heating and prevents bumping</span> of sea water.
- The <span class="hi-blue">thermometer</span> is to <span class="hi-blue">detect the boiling point</span> of the vapour.

> [!tip]
> For accurate control of heating, a <span class="hi-blue">water bath</span> can be used as a heat source.

# Simple set-up
![[simple_distillation_simple.webp|500]]
- The main benefit of this set-up is its relative simplicity and cheapness, since it does not utilize any condenser.
- However, the cooling effect is poorer.
