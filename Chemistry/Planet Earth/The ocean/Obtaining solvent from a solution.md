#### Simple distillation
**Simple distillation** is a <u>physical process</u> which boils and evaporates the solvent, then condenses its vapour so that the pure solvent can be obtained.

> **Note**:
> Sea water mainly consists of water and dissolved salts, but the dissolved salts have much higher boiling points than water. Water will boil and vaporize upon heating while the dissolved salt will not.
