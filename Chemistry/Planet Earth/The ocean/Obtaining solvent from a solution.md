#### Simple distillation
**Simple distillation** is a <u>physical process</u> which boils and evaporates the solvent, then condenses its vapour so that the pure solvent can be obtained.

> **Note**:
> Sea water mainly consists of water and dissolved salts, but the dissolved salts have much higher boiling points than water. Water will boil and vaporize upon heating while the dissolved salt will not. Thus, simple distillation is needed to obtain the solvent itself.

##### Simple set-up
![[simple_distillation_quickfit.webp|550]]
- The <span style="color: lightgreen">condenser</span> will be connected to the distillation flash. It provides a lower temperature to condense water vapour.
	- Cold tap water is kept flowing in the outer layer of the condenser, while the inner layer would condense the water vapour that reaches the top of the distillation flask.
	- Cooling water enters at the lower end to increase the effectiveness of cooling.
- The <span style="color: lightgreen">anti-bumping granules</span> is to ensure even heating and prevents bumping of sea water.
- The <span style="color: lightgreen">thermometer</span> is to detect the boiling point of the vapour.

##### Simple set-up

- The main benefit of this set-up is its relative simplicity and cheapness, since it does not utilize any condenser.
- However, the cooling effect is poorer.

##### Procedures
1. The solution is <u>heated up slowly</u>. The solvent (water) will vaporize and rise the distillation flask when the temperature has reached its boiling point.
	- The dissolved solutes (e.g. $\ce{NaCl}$) has a much higher boiling point than water / is non-volatile, they will not vaporize easily.

2. Eventually, the <span style="color: lightgreen">distillate</span> will be collected at the end of the condenser in a conical flask / test tube.
