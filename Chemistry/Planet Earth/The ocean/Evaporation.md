**Evaporation** is a <u>physical process</u> used to <u>obtain powder form of soluble solids</u> directly in a solution. It involves the <u>evaporation of solvent</u> by heat and leaves the <u>solute behind</u>.

1. Heat the solution to evaporate the solvent.
   (Use a water bath instead of direct naked flame when needed)
2. The powder of dissolved salt is obtained when most of the solvent has evaporated.
