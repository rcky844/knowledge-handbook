**Decantation** is a <span style="color: violet">physical process</span> used to separate a much denser <span style="color: aqua">insoluble solid from a liquid</span> by gravitational force.

---

**Problems**:
This method is simple but <u>not effective</u> as some insoluble solid may be disturbed and may flow into another beaker.

**Process**:
1. The solution / liquid is <u>settled down</u> to allow time for the insoluble solid in the solution to precipitate by gravity.
2. Pour the solution / liquid into another beaker <u>by the guide of a glass rod</u>, leaving the insoluble solid undisturbed at the original container.
