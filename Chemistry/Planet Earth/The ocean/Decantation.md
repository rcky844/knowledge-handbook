**Decantation** is a <span class="hi-blue">physical process</span> used to separate a much denser <span class="hi-green">insoluble solid from a liquid</span> by gravitational force.

---

*Problems*:
This method is simple but <u>not effective</u> as some insoluble solid may be disturbed and may flow into another beaker.

*Process*:
1. The solution is <u>settled down</u> to allow time for the insoluble solid in the solution to precipitate by gravity.
2. Pour the solution into another beaker <u>by the guide of a glass rod</u>,  insoluble solid is left undisturbed at the original container.
