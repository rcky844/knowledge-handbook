**Decantation** is a <u>physical process</u> used to separate a much denser insoluble solid from a liquid. This method is simple but <u>not effective</u> as some insoluble solid may be disturbed and may flow into another beaker.

1. The solution / liquid is <u>settled down</u> to allow time for the insoluble solid in the solution to precipitate by gravity.
2. Pour the solution / liquid into another beaker <u>by the guide of a glass rod</u>, leaving the insoluble solid undisturbed at the original container.
