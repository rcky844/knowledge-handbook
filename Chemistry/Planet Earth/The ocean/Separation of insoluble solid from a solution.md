#### Decantation
![[decantation.webp|400]]

**Decantation** is a <u>physical process</u> used to separate a much denser insoluble solid from a liquid. This method is simple but <u>not effective</u> as some insoluble solid may be disturbed and may flow into another beaker.

1. The solution / liquid is <u>settled down</u> to allow time for the insoluble solid in the solution to precipitate by gravity.
2. Pour the solution / liquid into another beaker <u>by the guide of a glass rod</u>, leaving the insoluble solid undisturbed at the original container.

#### Filtration
![[filtration.webp|320]]
**Filtration** is a <u>physical process</u> involving the use of <span style="color: lightgreen">filter paper</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">filter funnel</span> to separate insoluble solids from a liquid. It is more efficient than decantation.

> **Note**:
> <u>Tiny holes</u> exists on the filter paper that <u>only allow small particles (e.g. water molecules, dissolved salts) to pass through</u>. Sand and mud particles are too large to pass through.

The liquid that passes through and drops to the container is called <span style="color: violet">filtrate</span>, while the insoluble solid that is filtered and remains on the filter paper is called <span style="color: violet">residue</span>.

1. The liquid / solution together with insoluble solid will be poured into a filter funnel fitted with a piece of filter paper.
2. Wait for a period of time until all the liquid flows into the beaker through the filter paper. The addition of the liquid can be repeated.

> **Note**:
> Do not add a very large amount of liquid at once, otherwise it may cause an overflow.
