**Acidified silver nitrate test** is a chemical test for halide ions. It is used for the preliminary test for halogens such as chloride, bromide and iodine ions.

> **Note**:
> - Fluoride ions are not able to be tested as it does not form insoluble precipitate with silver ion.
> - Astatine is radioactive and "any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its radioactivity".

#### Procedure
1. Add dilute nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$) into the sample solution <u>until in excess</u>.
	- The purpose of acidification is to remove interfering ions (e.g. $\ce{SO3^2-}$, $\ce{CO3^2-}$) to prevent the formation of precipitate irrelevant to halide ions.
	  ↪️ $\ce{CO3^2- (aq) + 2H+ (aq) -> CO2 (g) + H2O (ℓ)}$
	  ↪️ $\ce{SO3^2- (aq) + 2H+ (aq) -> SO2 (g) + H2O (ℓ)}$

> **Note**:
> Result if sample is not acidified:
> ↪️ $\ce{CO3^2- (aq) + 2Ag+ (aq) -> Ag2CO3 (s)}$
> ↪️ $\ce{SO3^2- (aq) + 2Ag+ (aq) -> Ag2SO3 (s)}$
> 
> Choice of acid in acidification:
> - $\ce{HCl (aq)}$ contains $\ce{Cl- (aq)}$, which would interfere with the test.
> - $\ce{H2SO4 (aq)}$ contains $\ce{SO4^2- (aq)}$, which would interfere with the test.

2. Add silver nitrate solution ($\ce{AgNO3}$) into the acidified sample solution. Observe the colour of precipitate.

| Colour of precipitate | Identity of precipitate | Ionic equation |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| White | Silver chloride ($\ce{AgCl}$) | $\ce{Ag+ (aq) + Cl- (aq) -> AgCl (s)}$ |
| Pale yellow | Silver bromide ($\ce{AgBr}$) | $\ce{Ag+ (aq) + Br- (aq) -> AgBr (s)}$ |
| Yellow | Silver iodide ($\ce{AgI}$) | $\ce{Ag+ (aq) + I- (aq) -> AgI (s)}$ |
