#### Test with limewater
![[limewater_test.webp|400]]
**Limewater** produced in "[[Calcium carbonate and its reactions]]" can be used for detecting carbon dioxide.

**Test description**:
↪️ Carbon dioxide gas <u>turns limewater from colourless to milky</u>.

**Reaction**: $\ce{Ca(OH)2 (aq) + CO2 (g) -> CaCO3 (s) + H2O (ℓ)}$
- Insoluble calcium carbonate is formed upon <u>passing</u> carbon dioxide into limewater, turning the limewater milky.

> **Note**:
> Sulphur dioxide gas ($\ce{SO2}$) behaves similarily to carbon dioxide gas ($\ce{CO2}$). It can also turn limewater from colourless to milky by the following reaction:
> 
> $\ce{Ca(OH)2 (aq) + SO2 (g) -> CaSO3 (s) + H2O (ℓ)}$
> 
> Therefore, limewater test is only a preliminary test but not a specified test for carbon dioxide gas.
