**Flame test** is a <span class="hi-blue">physical test</span>. When the metallic ion is burnt in a Bunsen flame, they will give off different colours. The metallic element in a compound can be identified by the flame colour produced.

> [!tip] Choice and cleaning of apparatus
> A platinum or nichrome (alloy of nickel and chromium) wire will be used for the test, as they have <span class="hi-blue">high melting point and corrosion resistance</span>.
> 
> The wire used should be <span class="hi-green">cleaned before the experiment</span>.
> 
> To clean the platinum wire, <u>dip the wire into concentrated hydrochloric acid</u> and then heat it in the Bunsen flame until no characteristic flame colour is observed.

# Procedure
1. Dip a <span class="hi-blue">clean platinum / nichrome wire</span> into <u>concentrated hydrochloric acid</u> and heat in <u>Bunsen flame</u> (until no characteristic flame is observed).
2. Dip the nichrome wire into the <u>concentrated hydrochloric acid</u> and then the <u>solid sample</u>. (If the sample is in aqueous form, use [[evaporation]] or [[crystallization]] first)
3. Put the end of the wire in the (non-luminous) <span class="hi-blue">Bunsen flame</span> and observe the flame colour.

> [!warning]
> The wire should be <span class="hi-green">heated under naked flame</span>.
> 
> Heating the compound when it is placed inside of a test tube does not produce enough heat for the formation of the characteristic flame colours (spectral colours).

| Solid | Flame colour |
| :--: | :--: |
| Compound of potassium (potassium ion — $\ce{K+}$) | lilac flame |
| Compound of sodium (sodium ion — $\ce{Na+}$) | golden yellow flame |
| Compound of calcium (calcium ion — $\ce{Ca^2+}$) | brick-red flame |
| Compound of copper (copper(II) ion — $\ce{Cu^2+}$) | bluish green flame |
