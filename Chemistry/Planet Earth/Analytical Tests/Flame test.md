When the metallic ion is burnt in a Bunsen flame, they will give off different colours. The metallic element in a compound can be identified by the flame colour produced.

A platinum or nichrome wire will be used for the test, as they have high melting point and corrosion resistance.

> [!note]
> The wire used should be cleaned before the experiment.
> To clean the platinum wire, dip the wire into concentrated hydrochloric acid and then heat it in the Bunsen flame until no characteristic flame colour is observed.

#### Procedure
1. Dip a clean nichrome wire into <u>concentrated hydrochloric acid</u>.
2. Dip the nichrome wire into the <u>solid sample</u>. If the sample is in aqueous form, consider using one of the methods in "[[Obtaining soluble solid from a solution]]".
3. Put the end of the wire in the <u>Bunsen flame</u> and observe the colour of the flame.

| Solid | Flame colour |
| :--: | :--: |
| Compound of potassium (potassium ion — $\ce{K+}$) | lilac flame |
| Compound of sodium (sodium ion — $\ce{Na+}$) | golden yellow flame |
| Compound of calcium (calcium ion — $\ce{Ca^2+}$) | brick-red flame |
| Compound of copper (copper(II) ion — $\ce{Cu^2+}$) | bluish green flame |
