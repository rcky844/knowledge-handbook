Different components in air have different boiling points, they can be separated by a physical process called <span class="hi-green">fractional distillation of liquefied air</span>.

![[fractional_distillation_air.webp|550]]

1. **Purification**
	- <span class="hi-blue">Water vapour, carbon dioxide and dust</span> are removed as they might <u>accumulate and block the pipes</u>.

2. **Liquefaction**
    - Purified air is compressed at a very high pressure at the compressor, and passes through the cooling coils to cool down. It then passes through the expansion chamber and is expanded rapidly.
    - The process is <u>repeated several times</u> until the temperature of air drops to -200°C. The components of air becomes liquefied and the air becomes liquid.

3. **Fractional distillation of liquefied air**
	- Liquefied air is pumped into the bottom of a fractionating tower with its <span class="hi-green">bottom warmer than its top</span>.
	- <span class="hi-green">Different components have different boiling points.</span> When the temperature is higher than the boiling point of the component, the component would become gas and start vaporising up the column.

| Fraction (component) | Boiling point (°C) |
| :------------------: | :----------------: |
| Nitrogen ($\ce{N2}$) |        -196        |
|  Argon ($\ce{Ar}$)   |        -186        |
|  Oxygen ($\ce{O2}$)  |        -183        |

*Separation of common gases*:
- Nitrogen is vaporized and is collected at the top as gas.
- Argon is also vaporized but condenses at the centre and is collected as liquid.
- Liquid oxygen flow to the bottom and is collected.
