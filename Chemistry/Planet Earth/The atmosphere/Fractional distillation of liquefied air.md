Different components in air have different boiling points, they can be separated by a physical process called <span style="color: lightgreen">fractional distillation of liquefied air</span>.

1. <span style="color: lightgreen">Purification</span>
	- <u>Water vapour, carbon dioxide and dust are removed</u> as they might <u>accumulate and block the pipes</u>.

2. <span style="color: lightgreen">Liquefaction</span>
    - Purified air is <u>compressed at a very high pressure</u> at the compressor, and passes through the <u>cooling coils to cool down</u>. It then passes through the <u>expansion chamber and is expanded rapidly</u>.
    - The process is <u>repeated several times</u> until the temperature of air drops to -200°C. The components of air becomes liquefied and the air becomes liquid.

3. <span style="color: lightgreen">Fractional distillation of liquefied air</span>
	- Liquefied air is pumped into the bottom of a fractionating tower <u>with its bottom warmer than its top</u>.
	- <u>Different components have different boiling points.</u> When the temperature is higher than the boiling point of the component, the component would become gas and start vaporising up the column.

| Fraction (component) | Boiling point (°C) |
| :------------------: | :----------------: |
| Nitrogen ($\ce{N2}$) |        -196        |
|  Argon ($\ce{Ar}$)   |        -186        |
|  Oxygen ($\ce{O2}$)  |        -183        |
Table showing the boiling points of common air components ⤴️

- Nitrogen is vaporized and is collected at the top as gas.
- Argon is also vaporized but condenses at the centre and is collected as liquid.
- Liquid oxygen flow to the bottom and is collected.
