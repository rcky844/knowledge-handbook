#### Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)
Nitrogen is chemically <u>inert</u>. It does not react with other chemicals easily.
→ **Usage**: As the filling gas in food packaging

Nitrogen has a <u>low boiling point</u>, its liquid stays at a very low temperature.
→ **Usage**: As a refrigerant (ice-cream production or molecular gastronomy)

#### Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)
Oxygen is an <u>oxidising agent</u>. It is important for the oxidation for other substances.
→ **Usage**: Supporting combustion, For welding materials

Oxygen is essential for lots of organisms to maintain their lives by aerobic [[respiration]].

#### Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
Carbon dioxide is a relatively chemically <u>inert</u> gas. It does not react with other substances easily.
→ **Usage**: Fire extinguisher, Dry ice

Carbon dioxide is essential for plants to carry out [[photosynthesis]].

#### Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar)
They are all noble gases. They are chemically <u>inert</u>. They do not react with other substances easily.

Helium has a very <u>low density</u>, which is <u>lower than air</u>.
→ **Usage**: Fill helium balloons

Neon <u>glows and lights when electricity passes through</u>.
→ **Usage**: Fill neon light tubes / advertising signs

Argon is used to **fill light bulbs** as it <u>doesn't react with the metal (tungsten) filament</u>.
