> [!info] Nitrogen ($\ce{N2}$)
> - *Chemically inert* (low reactivity): Filling gas in food packaging
> - *Low boiling point* (liquid at low temperature): Refrigerant

> [!info] Oxygen ($\ce{O2}$)
> - *Oxidising agent*: Supporting combustion; For welding materials
> - *[[Aerobic respiration]]*: Maintaining lives of organisms

> [!info] Carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$)
> - *Chemically inert* (relatively): Fire extinguisher; Dry ice
> - *[[Photosynthesis]]*: Production of food in plants

> [!info] Noble gases
> They are all *chemically inert* and do not react with other substances easily.
> - **Helium** ($\ce{He}$): Lower density than air
>   ↪️ Fill helium balloons
> - **Neon** ($\ce{Ne}$): Glows and lights when electricity passes through
>   ↪️ Fill neon light tubes / advertising signs
> - **Argon** ($\ce{Ar}$)
>   ↪️ Fill light bulbs as it doesn't react with the metal (tungsten) filament
