**The atmosphere** is a layer of gases surrounding the Earth, consisting of the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and ionosphere.

We live in the layer closet to the ground, which contains a <u>mixture</u> of gases called **air**.
If its composition is measured by volume (100 cm<sup>3</sup>), air consists of the following composition by volume:

|                 Component                 | Percentage by volume |
| :---------------------------------------: | :------------------: |
|         Nitrogen / $\ce{N2 (g)}$          |         78%          |
|          Oxygen / $\ce{O2 (g)}$           |         21%          |
| Noble gases / $\ce{He (g)}$, $\ce{Ar(g)}$ |          1%          |
|      Carbon dioxide / $\ce{CO2 (g)}$      |     0.03 - 0.04%     |
|       Water vapour / $\ce{H2O (g)}$       |       variable       |

Individual components of air have [[Properties and uses of components of air|different uses]]. However, they are not found in nature, and has to be [[Separation of different components of air|separated from air]].
