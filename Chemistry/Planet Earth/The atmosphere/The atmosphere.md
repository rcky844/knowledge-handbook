**The atmosphere** consists of layers of gases surrounding the Earth. We live in the troposphere, which contains a <u>mixture</u> of gases called **air**.

#### Composition of air

|                 Component                 | Percentage by volume |
| :---------------------------------------: | :------------------: |
|         Nitrogen / $\ce{N2 (g)}$          |         78%          |
|          Oxygen / $\ce{O2 (g)}$           |         21%          |
| Noble gases / $\ce{He (g)}$, $\ce{Ar(g)}$ |          1%          |
|      Carbon dioxide / $\ce{CO2 (g)}$      |     0.03 - 0.04%     |
|       Water vapour / $\ce{H2O (g)}$       |       variable       |

- Individual components of air have [[Components of air|different uses]].
- They are not found in nature, and has to be [[Fractional distillation of liquefied air|separated from air]].
