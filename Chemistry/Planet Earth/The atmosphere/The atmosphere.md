**The atmosphere** is a layer of gases surrounding the Earth, consisting of the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and ionosphere.

We live in the layer closet to the ground, which contains a mixture of gases called **air**. It is a mixture consisting of different composition. If its composition is measured by volume (100 cm<sup>3</sup>), air consists of the following composition by volume:

|              Component              | Percentage by volume |
| :---------------------------------: | :------------------: |
|    Nitrogen / N<sub>2</sub> (g)     |         78%          |
|     Oxygen / O<sub>2</sub> (g)      |         21%          |
|    Noble gases / He (g), Ar (g)     |          1%          |
| Carbon dioxide / CO<sub>2</sub> (g) |     0.03 - 0.04%     |
|  Water vapour / H<sub>2</sub>O (g)  |       variable       |

Individual components of air have different uses. However, they are not found in nature, and has to be separated from air.

#### Properties and uses of components of air
##### Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)
Nitrogen is chemically <u>inert</u>. It does not react with other chemicals easily.
→ **Usage**: As the filling gas in food packaging

Nitrogen has a <u>low boiling point</u>, its liquid stays at a very low temperature.
→ **Usage**: As a refrigerant (ice-cream production or molecular gastronomy)

##### Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)
Oxygen is an <u>oxidising agent</u>. It is important for the oxidation for other substances.
→ **Usage**: Support of combustion, welding materials

Oxygen is essential for lots of organisms to maintain their lives by aerobic respiration.

##### Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
Carbon dioxide is a relatively chemically <u>inert</u> gas. It does not react with other substances easily.
→ **Usage**: Fire extinguisher, Dry ice

Carbon dioxide is essential for plants to carry out [[photosynthesis]].

##### Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar)
They are all noble gases. They are chemically <u>inert</u>. They do not react with other substances easily.

Helium has a very low density, which is lower than air. 
→ **Usage**: Fill helium balloons

Neon glows and lights when electricity passes through.
→ **Usage**: Fill neon light tubes / advertising signs

Argon is used to fill light bulbs as it doesn't react with the metal (tungsten) filament.

#### Separation of different components of air
Different components in air have different boiling points, they can be separated by a physical process called <u>fractional distillation of liquefied air</u>.
