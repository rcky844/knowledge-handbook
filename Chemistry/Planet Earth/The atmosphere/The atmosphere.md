**The atmosphere** is a layer of gases surrounding the Earth, consisting of the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and ionosphere.

We live in the layer closet to the ground, which contains a <u>mixture</u> of gases called **air**.
If its composition is measured by volume (100 cm<sup>3</sup>), air consists of the following composition by volume:

|              Component              | Percentage by volume |
| :---------------------------------: | :------------------: |
|    Nitrogen / N<sub>2</sub> (g)     |         78%          |
|     Oxygen / O<sub>2</sub> (g)      |         21%          |
|    Noble gases / He (g), Ar (g)     |          1%          |
| Carbon dioxide / CO<sub>2</sub> (g) |     0.03 - 0.04%     |
|  Water vapour / H<sub>2</sub>O (g)  |       variable       |

Individual components of air have [[Properties and uses of components of air|different uses]]. However, they are not found in nature, and has to be [[Separation of different components of air|separated from air]].
