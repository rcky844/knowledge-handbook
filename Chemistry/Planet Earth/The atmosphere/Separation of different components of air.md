Different components in air have different boiling points, they can be separated by a physical process called <span style="color: lightgreen">fractional distillation of liquefied air</span>.

![[fractional_distillation_air.webp|550]]

1. <span style="color: lightgreen">Purification</span>
	- <u>Water vapour, carbon dioxide and dust are removed</u> as they might <u>accumulate and block the pipes</u>.

2. <span style="color: lightgreen">Liquefaction</span>
    - Purified air is <u>compressed at a very high pressure</u> at the compressor, and passes through the <u>cooling coils to cool down</u>. It then passes through the <u>expansion chamber and is expanded rapidly</u>.
    - The process is <u>repeated several times</u> until the temperature of air drops to -200°C. The components of air becomes liquefied and the air becomes liquid.

3. <span style="color: lightgreen">Fractional distillation of liquefied air</span>
	- The liquefied air is pumped into the bottom of a fractionating column <u>with the bottom warmer than its top</u>.
	- <u>When the temperature is higher than the boiling point of the component, the component would become gas and start vaporising up the column.</u>

|   Fraction (component)   | Boiling point (°C) |
| :----------------------: | :----------------: |
| Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) |        -196        |
|        Argon (Ar)        |        -186        |
|  Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)  |        -183        |
Table showing the boiling points of common air components ⤴️

- Nitrogen and argon vaporise and rises up the tower, oxygen remains as liquid and is collected.
- Argon condenses to liquid at the centre and is collected as a liquid.
- Nitrogen rises to the top and is collected as a gas.
