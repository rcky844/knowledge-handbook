#### General precautions
- Perform the experiment in a fume cupboard. (e.g. $\ce{CO}$, $\ce{Cl2}$)
	- For removal of air-borne hazardous substances.
- Wear safety gloves and safety goggles.
- To dilute concentrated acid, add a small amount of concentrated acid to a large amount of cold distilled water with stirring. (part of [[Acids and Bases]])
	- Doing the opposite may cause concentrated acid to splash out during the highly exothermic reaction.
- Make sure there is no reducing agent around strong oxidizing agents.

#### Sucking back / flowing back
**Example**: HKDSE 2021 1B Q6
Lead is obtained from lead(II) oxide, producing nitrogen gas and <u>steam</u>.

- **The reaction tube is placed in a <u>downward slanted position</u>.**
  To prevent the condensed water from flowing back, which can crack the test tube.

- **The experiment is performed in a fume cupboard.**
  Ammonia is poisonous. / Lead(II) oxide is toxic. / Lead is toxic.

**Example**: HKDSE 2016 1B Q3

When no more gas can be collected, the following should be done to end the experiment for safety consideration:
- Remove the delivery tube from the water before removing the water source.
- This prevents the water from <u>sucking back</u>, which can crack the boiling tube.
