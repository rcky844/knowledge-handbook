**Particle theory** states that all matter is made up of particles. These particles are so small that we cannot see them with the naked eye, but some simple experiments confirm that they do exist.

#### Experiments
##### Dissolving crystal in water
- **Experiment**: Placing a potassium permanganate crystal (purple) in water.
- **Observation**: The lump of potassium permanganate crystal dissolved in water gradually.
- **Deduced explanation**: The <u>particles</u> of potassium permanganate leave the crystal and <u>mix</u> through the water particles.

##### Spreading of bromine vapour
- **Experiment**: Placing a jar of air upside down on a jar of bromine vapour.
- **Observation**: The bromine vapour has spread throughout both jars after a period of time.
- **Deduced explanation**: The <span style="color: lightgreen">bromine particles</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">air particles</span> <u>move around randomly</u> and fill both gas jars. ([[Diffusion]])

#### State of substances
> **Note**:
> The states discussed here are measured at <u>room temperature and pressure</u> (25°C, 1 atm). Information regarding supercritical states or similar will not be included in the Knowledge Handbook at this time.

##### Solid state (s)
Particles in this state are <u>tightly packed, usually in a regular pattern</u>. Therefore, they have the <u>highest density</u> in general. Although the particles can vibrate in a solid, they generally do not move from place to place.

##### Liquid state (ℓ)
Particles in this state are <u>close together with no regular arrangement</u>. Therefore, they have lower density than solids in general. The particles in this state can vibrate, <u>move about and slide past</u> each other.

##### Gaseous state (g)
Particles in this state are well separated with no regular arrangement. Therefore, they have the lowest density in general. The particles in this state can vibrate and <u>move freely</u> at high speeds.

#### Change of states
Change of states is an example of physical change.

- Melting, evaporation and sublimation are all <u>endothermic</u> reactions, as these types of state changes <u>increase the temperature</u>.
- Freezing, condensation and deposition are all <u>exothermic</u> reactions, as these types of state changes <u>decrease the temperature</u>.

##### Relationship between temperature and physical states
Take water as an example:
![[temp_phystate.webp]]

At any temperature $x$°C, the following conditions are true:
- If (s): $x$ < m.p.
- If (ℓ): b.p. > $x$ > m.p.
- If (g): $x$ > b.p.
