# Displacement of water
![[displacement_of_water.webp|300]]

*Conditions*:
- For collecting gases which is insoluble in water.
- Gas collected is wet.

*Examples*: $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{N2}$
- Not suitable for collecting water-soluble gases.
  (e.g. $\ce{NH3 (g)}$, $\ce{HCl (g)}$, $\ce{SO2 (g)}$, $\ce{CO2 (g)}$)

# Upward delivery
![[upward_delivery.webp|180]]

*Conditions*:
- For collecting gases less dense than air.

*Examples*: $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{NH3}$, $\ce{CH4}$
(less dense than air)

# Downward delivery
![[downward_delivery.webp|180]]

*Conditions*:
- For collecting gases denser than air

*Examples*: $\ce{HCl}$, $\ce{Cl2}$, $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{SO2}$
(denser than air)

# Syringe
![[syringe.webp|200]]
One of the most versatile gas collection method.

*Conditions*:
- Gases with not enough pressure cannot be collected.
- Experimental condition requiring strong heating cannot be collected, as a higher pressure may be created.
