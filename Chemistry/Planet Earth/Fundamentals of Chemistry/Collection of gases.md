> To determine the most appropriate gas collection method, the relative atomic mass can be calculated. It is then compared to a <span style="color: lightgreen">rough value of the mass of air (e.g. 28.56)</span>.
#### Displacement of water
![[displacement_of_water.webp|300]]

**Conditions**:
- For collecting gases which is insoluble in water.
- Gas collected is wet.

**Examples**: $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{N2}$
- Not suitable for collecting water-soluble gases.
  (e.g. $\ce{NH3 (g)}$, $\ce{HCl (g)}$, $\ce{SO2 (g)}$, $\ce{CO2 (g)}$)

#### Upward delivery

**Conditions**:
- For collecting gases less dense than air.

**Examples**: $\ce{H2}$, $\ce{NH3}$, $\ce{CH4}$

#### Downward delivery

**Conditions**:
- For collecting gases denser than air

**Examples**: $\ce{HCl}$, $\ce{Cl2}$, $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{SO2}$

#### Syringe

One of the most versatile gas collection method.

**Conditions**:
- Gases with not enough pressure cannot be collected.
- Experimental condition requiring strong heating cannot be collected, as a higher pressure may be created.
