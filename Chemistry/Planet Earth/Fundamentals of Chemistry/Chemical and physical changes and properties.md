# Physical change and physical property
**Physical change** is a change <span class="hi-green">without new substance formed</span>. These changes can be reversed easily.

*Examples*:
- Changing the state of a substance (e.g. boiling water)
- Changing the appearance of a substance (e.g. grinding big lumps of limestone into fine powder)
- Dissolving a solid in a liquid (e.g. dissolving sugar in water)

---

The **physical properties** of a substance are properties that can be observed or measured without changing the chemical composition of the substance.

*Examples*:
- Melting point, Boiling point
- Colour, Odour
- State, Density, Hardness
- Electrical conductivity

> [!note]
> For example, ice melting into water at 0Â°C is a physical property of ice.

# Chemical change and chemical property
**Chemical change** is a change <span class="hi-green">without new substance formed</span>. These changes are difficult to reverse.

*Examples*:
- Burning magnesium to form a white powder
- Heating a mixture of iron fillings to sulphur to form a dark brown solid
- Rusting of iron

---

The **chemical properties** of a substance are properties that can observed or measured only when the substance undergoes a chemical change to form new substance.

*Examples*:
- Flammability, oxidizability
- Toxicity
- Reaction of substances with other matters

# Iron sulphur experiment
Iron powder has magnetic property. When iron is mixed with sulphur powder, no particular chemical reaction occurs and no new substances are formed. The mixing process is a physical change. When a magnet is placed near the iron powder, it would try to stick on the magnet and follow its movement.

However, when the iron is heated with sulphur, the heat provided triggers a chemical reaction to form a new substance ($\ce{FeS}$). The nature of iron has been changed, it can no longer exhibit the magnetic property.
