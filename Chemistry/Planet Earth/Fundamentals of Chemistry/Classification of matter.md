> **Note**:
> Comparing pure substances and mixture, pure substances would have sharp physical properties (such as boiling point and melting point) while mixtures do not.

#### Pure substances
**Pure substances** are <u>single substances</u> that has nothing else mixed with it.

**Examples**:
- Copper (Cu)
- Chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>)
- Distilled water (H<sub>2</sub>O)

##### Elements
**Elements** are substances which cannot be broken down into anything simpler by chemical methods. Substances that can be broken down into simpler substances by electricity, for example, is not an element.

**Examples**:
- Carbon (C)
- Aluminium (Al)
- Copper (Cu)

##### Compounds
**Compounds** are substances composed of two or more elements chemically joined together. They can be broken down into simpler substances by chemical methods.

**Examples**:
- Sodium chloride (NaCl)
- Water (H<sub>2</sub>O)
- Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)

#### Mixtures
**Mixtures** consists of <u>two or more pure substances</u> which are <u>not chemically joined together</u>. Different pure substances in mixtures can be separated by a physical method.

**Examples**:
- Soda water (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O)
- Wine (H<sub>2</sub>O, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH and other substances)
- Rock salt (NaCl, SiO<sub>2</sub> and other substances)
