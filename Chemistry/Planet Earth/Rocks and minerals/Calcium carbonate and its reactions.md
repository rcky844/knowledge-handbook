Limestone is one of the most common types of rock found in Earth’s crust. It is composed primarily of calcite. The major composition of calcite is <u>calcium carbonate</u>.

**Calcium carbonate** ($\ce{CaCO3}$) occurs naturally in mainly three forms:
- Chalk
- Limestone
- Marble

 **Formation of chalk in the Earth's crust**:
 Chalk is formed from the skeletons and shells of animals containing calcium carbonate when their dead remains sink to the seabed, the action of heat and pressure will gradually turn the dead remains into chalk. Earth movements such as earthquake will bring these layers of chalk to the Earth's surface.

**Differences in strength between chalk, limestone and marble**:
Higher pressure and heat cause chalk to turn into much harder limestone. Even higher pressure and heat would turn limestone into marble.
↪️ Strength: marble > limestone > chalk

#### Chemical reactions of calcium carbonate
![[caco3_cycle.svg]]
**Calcium carbonate** ($\ce{CaCO3}$) is a white solid / powder, and is <u>insoluble</u> in water.

- **Step 1**: Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate
  Calcium carbonate will be decomposed on strong heating into calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide.
  ↪️ $\ce{CaCO3 (s) -> CaO (s) + CO2 (g)}$

- **Step 2**: Addition of little water to calcium oxide
  When a few drops of water is added to calcium oxide (quicklime), it becomes crumbled and water is absorbed. Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) is formed.
  ↪️ $\ce{CaO (s) + H2O (ℓ) -> Ca(OH)2 (s)}$

- **Step 3**: Addition of excess water to calcium hydroxide
  When calcium hydroxide is added into excess amount of water, the amount of water is sufficient to dissolve the slightly soluble calcium hydroxide. Soluble aqueous calcium hydroxide (limewater) is formed. It is a colourless solution.
  ↪️ $\ce{Ca(OH)2 (s) ->[dissolve] Ca(OH)2 (aq)}$
	- Saturated limewater is used to for chemical tests, it can be produced by adding excess slaked lime ($\ce{Ca(OH)2 (s)}$) into water, and filtered off to remove the excess undissolved solid.

- **Step 4**: Addition of excess carbon dioxide to limewater
  *See also: [[Test for carbon dioxide gas]]*
  Passing carbon dioxide gas into limewater turns it <u>from colourless to milky</u> due to the formation of insoluble calcium carbonate.
  ↪️ $\ce{Ca(OH)2 (aq) + CO2 (g) -> CaCO3 (s) + H2O (ℓ)}$

#### Additional chemical reactions
- When <u><span style="color: skyblue">excess</span> carbon dioxide is passed into limewater</u>, the solution turns <u>from milky to colourless</u> due to the formation of water soluble calcium hydrogencarbonate ($\ce{Ca(HCO3)2 (aq)}$).
  ↪️ $\ce{CaCO3 (s) + H2O (ℓ) + CO2 (g) -> Ca(HCO3)2 (aq)}$

- Calcium can also react with carbonic acid ($\ce{H2CO3}$) to form calcium hydrogencarbonate ($\ce{Ca(HCO3)2 (aq)}$).
  ↪️ $\ce{CaCO3 (s) + H2CO3 (aq) -> Ca(HCO3)2 (aq)}$

- Calcium can also react with hydrochloric acid ($\ce{HCl (aq)}$) to give a dissolved salt of $\ce{CaCl2 (aq)}$, colourless gas bubble of $\ce{CO2 (g)}$ and $\ce{H2O (ℓ)}$.
  ↪️ $\ce{CaCO3 (s) + 2HCl (aq) -> CaCl2 (aq) + CO2 (g) + H2O (ℓ)}$

#### Uses of products in the calcium carbonate cycle
**Limestone**:
- For neutralising acidic pollutants in flue gas
- For making glass
- For construction of building and roads
- For neutralising waste water

**Quicklime**:
- For making steel from iron
- For making cement
- For neutralising soil acidity

**Slaked lime**:
- For neutralising waste water

#### Environmental problems with chemistry of calcium carbonate
Air consists of carbon dioxide (some formed naturally while others are from industrial processes). When rain falls, the water reacts with carbon dioxide to form <span style="color: lightgreen">carbonic acid</span>.
- Normal rainwater is slightly acidic and has a pH level of 5.0 ~ 5.5. <u>Carbonic acid is not the source to cause acid rain.</u>
- Acid rain is caused by [[other pollutants produced from industrial plants]]. They dissolve in rainwater to make it more acidic (with a pH level lower than 4).

Many man-made buildings and natural craves are made up of calcium carbonate. However, when the carbonic acid in rainwater contacts with these structures, erosion may occur as a reaction causes the calcium carbonate to form water-soluble calcium hydrogencarbonate. These structures will gradually dissolve. Constant repairs are required.
