#### Average rate of reaction
**Average rate of reaction** is the rate of reaction at a certain period of time.

If not specified, the average rate of reaction usually refers to the rate of reaction at the time period from the beginning to the finished moment of reaction.

It is calculated by $\text{Total change in content of product (or reactant)}\over\text{Total time taken for the reaction}$.

#### Instantaneous rate of reaction
**Instantaneous rate of reaction** is the rate of reaction at a certain point of time.

To calculate the instantaneous rate of reaction, draw a tangent to the curve at that point of time. The slope of the tangent represents the instantaneous rate of reaction at that point of time.

Slope of tangent is calculated by ${y_2 - y_1}\over{x_2 - x_1}$.

#### Initial rate of reaction
**Initial rate of reaction** is the instantaneous rate at t = 0 (the beginning of the reaction).
