# Average rate of reaction
**Average rate of reaction** is the rate of reaction at a <u>particular moment of time</u> / from the beginning to the finished moment of reaction.

If not specified, the average rate of reaction usually refers to the <span class="hi-green">rate of reaction at the time period from the beginning to the finished moment of reaction</span>.

*Formula*: $\text{Total change in content of product (or reactant)}\over\text{Total time taken for the reaction}$.

# Instantaneous rate of reaction
**Instantaneous rate of reaction** is the rate of reaction at a <u>certain point of time</u>.

To calculate the instantaneous rate of reaction, <span class="hi-green">draw a tangent to the curve at that point of time</span>. <span class="hi-orange">The slope of the tangent represents the instantaneous rate of reaction at that point of time.</span>

*Formula*: ${y_2 - y_1}\over{x_2 - x_1}$ (Slope of tangent)

# Initial rate of reaction
**Initial rate of reaction** is the <span class="hi-blue">instantaneous rate at t = 0</span> (the beginning of the reaction).

To calculate the initial rate of reaction, <span class="hi-green">draw a tangent to the curve passing through the origin</span>. <span class="hi-orange">The slope of the tangent represents the initial rate of reaction.</span>
