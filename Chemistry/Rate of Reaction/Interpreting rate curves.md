- **At time = 0**
  There are no products present.

- **At time > 0 & time < T**
  Curve is steep at first, then become less steep. Product increases with time while the production of products slow down.

- **At time > T**
  No more products are produced.

- **Identity of chemical species**
  The reactant will decrease in amount while the product will increase in amount during the reaction.
  ↪️ $\ce{Q(g)}$ is a reactant, while $\ce{P(g)}$ is a product.

> [!note]
> In completed irreversible reactions, no limiting reagent is left.

- **Ratio of change of chemical species**
  Rate curves have to follow the stochiometric ratio of a chemical equation. In the above example, $\ce{Q(g) -> 2P(g)}$.
  ↪️ The <span style="color: lightgreen">change</span> (increase) in amount of $\ce{P}$ double the <span style="color: lightgreen">change</span> (decrease) in amount of $\ce{Q}$.
