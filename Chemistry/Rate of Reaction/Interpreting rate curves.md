- **At time = 0**
  There are no products present. The reaction will proceed at the highest rate.

- **At time > 0 & time < T**
  Curve is <span class="hi-green">steep</span> at first, then become <span class="hi-green">less steep</span>. Product increases with time while the production of products slow down.

- **At time > T**
  No more products are produced. The curve becomes a <span class="hi-green">flat line</span> and level off.

- **Identification of chemical species**
  The <span class="hi-green">reactant will decrease in amount</span> while the <span class="hi-green">product will increase in amount</span> during the reaction.
  ↪️ $\ce{Q(g)}$ is a reactant, while $\ce{P(g)}$ is a product.

> [!note]
> In completed irreversible reactions, no limiting reagent is left.

- **Ratio of change of chemical species**
  Rate curves have to follow the stochiometric ratio of a chemical equation. In the above example, $\ce{Q(g) -> 2P(g)}$.
  ↪️ The <span class="hi-green">change</span> (increase) in amount of $\ce{P}$ double the <span class="hi-green">change</span> (decrease) in amount of $\ce{Q}$.

**Comparing differences in the curves**:
- The curve of trial 2 is <span class="hi-green"><u>steeper / levels off earlier</u></span> than the curve of trial 1.
- Since the <span style="color: aqua">concentration of reactant of trail 2 used is higher than that in trial 1</span>, the <u>rate</u> of reaction in trial 2 is <span class="hi-green"><u>higher</u></span> than that in trial 1.
