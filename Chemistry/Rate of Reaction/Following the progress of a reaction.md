The methods to follow the progress of a reaction are classified by the following:
- Methods based on <u>physical properties</u> of the reaction mixture
- Method based on <u>titrimetric analysis</u>

# Physical properties
## Gas collection
- **Physical parameter**: <span class="hi-blue">Volume</span> (of gas)
- **Description**: The production of a gaseous product increases the volume of gas. It is performed in a <span class="hi-blue">closed system</span>.
- **Process**: Volume of gas produced is <span class="hi-green">measured at a regular time interval</span>.

*Requirements*:
- Ensure the set-up is <span class="hi-green">airtight</span> with no leakage of gas
- Gas produced should <span class="hi-green">not be highly soluble in water</span>

![[gas_syringe.webp|220]]

> [!tip]
> If a gas is highly soluble in water (e.g. $\ce{CO2(g)}$), the reaction mixture can be saturated with the gas before the reaction begins.
> 
> As the gas is <span class="hi-green">highly soluble in water</span>, it makes sure that <span class="hi-green">no gas produced from the reaction can dissolve in the solution</span>.

> [!note]
> There is a similar device used for measuring the rate of reaction, but uses the measured gas as a reactant instead.

## Gas release
- **Physical parameter**: <span class="hi-blue">Mass</span> (of set-up)
- **Description**: The decrease in mass of reaction mixture is equal to the mass of gas given off. It is performed in an <span class="hi-blue">open system</span>.
- **Process**: Gas given off during a chemical reaction is <span class="hi-green">allowed to escape</span> from the reaction mixture, which <span class="hi-green">causes mass to decrease</span>.

> [!note]
> - The <span class="hi-blue">cotton wool</span> is used to <u>prevent the spilling of the reaction mixture</u>.
> - Release of <span class="hi-blue">hydrogen gas</span> may not be followed accurately, it is <span class="hi-green">too light</span> ($2\,\pu{g mol-1}$) to be measured in an accurate way.

## Change in gas pressure
- **Physical parameter**: <span class="hi-blue">Pressure</span> (of closed reaction system)
- **Process**: A <span class="hi-blue">closed system</span> (airtight) is <span class="hi-green">attached to a pressure sensor connected to a data-logger / computer</span>.

> [!note]
> - This method is suitable for measuring reactions involving hydrogen gas or unbalanced stochiometric ratio of gaseous reactants and products.
> - The reactants would firstly be separated (as setting up takes time). The vial (or similar) containing the reactants is then tilted to mix with other (solid) reactants.

## Change in pH
- **Description**: Useful for reactions involving a change in $\ce{[H+(aq)]}$
- **Process**: By using a <span class="hi-blue">pH meter</span>, and measuring the <span class="hi-green">change of pH value of the reaction mixture</span> throughout the experiment <span class="hi-green"><u>at regular intervals</u></span>.

*Example*: $\ce{5NaBr(aq) + NaBrO3(aq) + 6HCl(aq) -> 3Br2(aq) + 6NaCl(aq) + 3H2O(ℓ)}$

> [!warning]
> When both reactants and products contain acidic substances, inaccuracies can occur. It is not advised to employ this method in this situation.

## Change in electrical conductivity
- **Description**: Useful for reactions involving the <span class="hi-green">change in concentration / number of mobile ions</span>, as electrical conductivity will change.
- **Process**: An <span style="color: aqua">ammeter</span> is used for measuring the electrical conductivity.

*Example*: $\ce{I2 (aq) + CH3COCH3 (aq) -> CH3COCH2I (aq) + H+ (aq) + I- (aq)}$

## Change in colour intensity
*See also: [[]]* <!-- TODO: Add Analytical Chemistry topic on this -->
- **Physical parameter**: <span class="hi-blue">Light absorbance</span> (of the reaction mixture)
- **Description**: Useful for reactions involving a <span class="hi-blue">coloured reactant or product</span>.

![[absorbance.webp|600]]
- <span class="hi-green">Light absorbance is directly proportional to the colour intensity of the reaction mixture.</span> The more intense the colour intensity of the solution, the higher concentration of coloured species in the reaction mixture.
- The absorbance of a solution is measured by the <span class="hi-blue">colorimeter</span>.

*Example*: $\ce{MnO4-(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e- -> Mn^2+(aq) + 4H2O(ℓ)}$

## Change in light transmittance
In reactions that consumes or produces a solid, the <u>'disappearing-cross' / 'cross-blocking'</u> method can be used.

![[transmittance.webp|550]]

To reach the <span class="hi-green">opaque / turbid stage</span> of the reaction mixture, there must be an enough amount of solid sulphur formed to block the cross.

- **Physical parameter**: <span class="hi-blue">Light transmittance / Turbidity</span>
- **Calculation**: $\text{Average rate} ∝ {1\over\text{Time to reach opaque stage}}$ (inversely proportional)

*Disadvantages*:
- The method is not accurate as the average rate is only inversely proportional to the time, not directly equal to.
- The initial rate can only be approximated as it is <span class="hi-green">difficult to determine the time to reach the opaque stage</span>.

*Example*: $\ce{S2O3^2-(aq) + 2H+(aq) → SO2(aq) + H2O(ℓ) + S(s)}$
↪ $\ce{S2O3^2-(aq)}$: thiosulphate ion

> [!note]
> - This method is not suitable for applying to reactions which is rapid, since it is not possible to measure the time for the precipitate to form. One example of such reaction is <span class="hi-blue">precipitation</span>.
> - For more accurate measurements, use a light sensor to <u>measure the light transmittance</u> of the reaction mixture.

# Titration
This method involves <span class="hi-green">withdrawing</span> and analysing small portions of known volumes <span class="hi-green"><u>at regular time intervals</u></span>.

**Quenching** is a method used with this method. It <span class="hi-green">prevents further changes</span> in the concentration of the small portions.

*Methods*:
- **Cooling the sample in ice rapidly**
  Ice provides a <span class="hi-blue">low temperature</span> which can <span class="hi-green">slow down</span> the reaction.

- **Diluting with large volume of ice-cold water**
  This can <span class="hi-green">lower both the temperature and concentrations of reactants</span> to decrease the rate of reaction.

- **Removing the catalyst**
  Removing the catalyst can <span class="hi-green">slow down or stop</span> any further reaction.

*Advantages*:
- Titrimetric analysis can be applied to <u>most reactions</u>.
- Only <u>simple</u> laboratory apparatus are required.

*Disadvantages*:
- Withdrawal process of samples <u>disturbs</u> the reaction as the volume of the reaction mixture has changed.
- <u>Continuous measurement</u> of concentration is impossible.
- Titrimetric analysis takes time and thus <u>cannot be used for rapid reactions</u>.

*Example*: HKALE 1997 Paper 2 Q3(a)(i)
$$
\ce{CH3COCH3(aq) + I2(aq) -> CH3COCH2I(aq) + H+(aq) + I-(aq)}
$$
The progress of the reaction can be monitored by a titrimetric method. Outline the experimental procedure.
- At regular time intervals, <span class="hi-green">withdraw</span> a known value of the reaction mixture.
- Add it to excess $\ce{NaHCO3}$ to <span class="hi-green">quench</span> the reaction (in order to remove the catalyst).
- <span class="hi-green">Titrate</span> against standard $\ce{S2O3^2-}$ using starch as indicator.
