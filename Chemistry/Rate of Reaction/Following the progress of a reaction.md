This article introduces the methods to follow the progress of a reaction. They are separated by the following:
- Methods based on physical properties of the reaction mixture
- Method based on titrimetric analysis

#### Physical properties
##### Gas collection
- **Physical parameter**: Volume (of gas)
- **Description**: The production of a gaseous product increases the volume of gas produced. It is performed in a closed system.
- **Process**: Volume of gas produced is measured at a regular time interval.

**Requirements**:
- Ensure the set-up is airtight with no leakage of gas
- Gas produced should not be highly soluble in water

> **Note**:
> There is a similar device used for measuring the rate of reaction, but uses the measured gas as a reactant instead.

##### Gas release
- **Physical parameter**: Mass (of set-up)
- **Description**: Gas given off during a chemical reaction is allowed to escape from the reaction mixture, which causes mass to decrease. It is performed in an open system.
- **Calculations**: The decrease in mass of reaction mixture is equal to the mass of gas given off.

> **Note**:
> - The cotton wool is used to <u>prevent the spilling of the reaction mixture</u>.
> - Release of hydrogen gas may not be followed accurately. It is too light ($2\pu{g mol-1}$) to be measured in an accurate way.

##### Change in gas pressure
- **Physical parameter**: Pressure (of closed reaction system)
- **Description**: A closed system (airtight) is attached to a pressure sensor connected to a data-logger / computer.

> **Note**:
> - This method is suitable for measuring reactions involving hydrogen gas or unbalanced stochiometric ratio of gaseous reactants and products.
> - The reactants would firstly be separated (as setting up takes time). The vial (or similar) containing the reactants is then tilted to mix with other (solid) reactants.

##### Change in pH
- **Description**: Useful for reactions involving a change in concentration of hydrogen ion ($\ce{H+}$). pH level of reaction mixture is measured at a regular time interval.
- **Process**: By using a pH meter, and measuring the change of pH value of the reaction mixture throughout the experiment.

> **Note**:
> When both reactants and products contain acidic substances, inaccuracies can occur.

##### Change in electrical conductivity
- **Description**: Useful for reactions involving the change of concentration / number of mobile ions, as electrical conductivity will change.
- **Process**: An ammeter is used for measuring the electrical conductivity.

**Example reaction**: $\ce{I2 (aq) + CH3COCH3 (aq) -> CH3COCH2I (aq) + H+ (aq) + I- (aq)}$

##### Change in colour intensity
- **Physical property**: Light absorbance (of the reaction mixture)
- **Description**: Useful for reactions involving a coloured reactant or product.

The more intense the colour intensity of the solution, the higher concentration of the coloured species in the reaction mixture.

![[absorbance.webp|600]]
- Light intensity is directly proportional to the colour intensity of the reaction mixture. When the reaction mixture is more intense in colour, the more light it can absorb.
- The absorbance of a solution is measured by the **colorimeter**.

**Example reaction**: $\ce{MnO4- (aq) -> Mn^2+ (aq)}$

##### Change in light transmittance
Consider the reaction:
$\ce{S2O3^2-(aq) + 2H+(aq) → SO2(aq) + H2O(ℓ) + S(s)}$ (thiosulphate ion: $\ce{S2O3^2-}$).

![[transmittance.webp|550]]

To reach the opaque / turbid stage of the reaction mixture, there must be an enough amount of solid sulphur formed to block the cross.

**Physical property**: Light transmittance / Turbidity

$\text{Average rate} ∝ {1\over\text{Time to reach opaque stage}}$ (inversely proportional)

**Disadvantages for determining initial rate**:
- The initial rate can only be approximated as it is difficult to determine the time to reach the opaque stage.

> **Note**:
> - This method is not suitable for applying to reactions which is rapid, since it is not possible to measure the time for the precipitate to form. One example of such reaction is **precipitation**.
> - For more accurate measurements, use a light sensor to <u>measure the light transmittance</u> of the reaction mixture.

#### Titration
This method involves withdrawing and analysing small portions of known volumes at regular time intervals.

**Quenching** is a method used with this method. It prevents further changes in the concentration of the small portions.
- Cooling (rapidly in ice)\
- Diluting (with sufficient amount of cold water)
- Titrate the small portions to remove products
