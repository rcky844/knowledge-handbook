*Pre-context: [[]]* <!-- TODO: add when enthalpy is added -->

For a chemical reaction to take place, the reactant particles must collide. The collision must also be an <span class="hi-blue">effective collision</span>.

# Conditions for effective collision
1. The reactant particles <u>must collide in a proper orientation</u>.
2. The reactant particles <u>possess kinetic energy equal or greater</u> than the [[Activation energy and energy profiles|activation energy]].
