#### Concentration of reactant
Generally, a <u>higher concentration of reactants</u> results in a <u>higher rate of reaction</u>.

Consider the reaction: $\ce{Mg + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2}$

| Curve | $\ce{[HCl (aq)]}$ | $\text{Mass of }\ce{Mg}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A | $\pu{1.0 mol dm^-3}$ | $\pu{5g}$ |
| B | $\pu{0.5 mol dm^-3}$ | $\pu{5g}$ |
| C | $\pu{1.0 mol dm^-3}$ | $\pu{10g}$ |

**Comparison of reaction rates at different times** (refer to curve A):
- The reaction rate at the beginning of reaction is the highest as the initial concentration of the reactants is the highest.
- The reaction rate then decreases with time as the concentration of reactants decreases with time.

**Comparison of reaction rates at different curves**:
<u>Comparing curve A and B</u>
- The <u>reaction rate for curve A is higher</u> than that of curve B at any time as the concentration of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ of curve A is higher than that of curve B.
- <u>Curve A levels off earlier</u> than that of curve B as the <u>reaction completes earlier</u>.

> **Note**:
> Same volume of hydrogen gas is produced, as $\ce{HCl}$ is in excess, while $\ce{Mg}$ is the limiting reagent.

<u>Comparing curve A and C</u>
- Similar to curve A and B, reaction rate for curve C is higher.
- More product is produced as $\ce{Mg}$ is the limiting reagent.

**Explaining effects of concentration from molecular level**:
- The <u>number of reactant particles in a unit volume increases</u> when the concentration is increased.
- The <u>collision frequency</u> and hence the <u>effective collision increases</u>.

> **Note**:
> - Changing only the volume of a reagent used (e.g. $\ce{HCl}$) without a change in its concentration results in the same initial rate of reaction.
> - In some instances, the total volume of the reaction mixture is kept the same between different trials, with a higher volume of the reagent and a lower volume of water in different trials. This is to allow the <u>concentration</u> of the reagent to be directly proportional to the <u>volume</u> of the reagent used.

#### Temperature of reaction

- The reactant particles move faster and collide with each other more frequently.
- The collision frequency increases and hence the effective collision increases.
OR
- More reactant particles have energy equal or greater than the activation energy.
- The effective collision increases.
- The rate of reaction increases.

#### Surface area of solid reactant
![[surface_area_rate.webp|600]]
- The collision frequency increases and hence the effective collision increases.

#### Presence of a catalyst
- More reactant particles have energy equal or greater than the activation energy.
- The effective collision increases.

> **Note**:
> The rate of reaction is independent of the amount of catalyst added.
