# Concentration of reactant
Generally, a <u>higher concentration of reactants</u> results in a <u>higher rate of reaction</u>.

Consider the reaction: $\ce{Mg + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2}$

| Curve | $\ce{[HCl (aq)]}$ | $\text{Mass of }\ce{Mg}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A | $\pu{1.0 mol dm^-3}$ | $\pu{5g}$ |
| B | $\pu{0.5 mol dm^-3}$ | $\pu{5g}$ |
| C | $\pu{1.0 mol dm^-3}$ | $\pu{10g}$ |

*Comparison of reaction rates at different times*: (refer to curve A)
- The <span class="hi-green">reaction rate at the beginning of reaction is the highest</span> as the <span class="hi-blue">initial concentration</span> of the reactants is the highest.
- The <span class="hi-green">reaction rate then decrease progressively during the reaction</span> as the <span class="hi-blue">concentration of reactants decreases</span> with time.

*Comparison of reaction rates at different curves*:
<u>Comparing curve A and B</u>
- The <span class="hi-green">reaction rate for curve A is <u>steeper</u></span> than curve B as the concentration of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ of curve A is higher than curve B.
- <span class="hi-green">Curve A <u>levels off earlier</u></span> than that of curve B as the <span class="hi-blue">reaction completes earlier</span>.
- However, the <u>same volume of hydrogen gas is produced</u>, as $\ce{HCl}$ is in excess, while $\ce{Mg}$ is the limiting reagent.

<u>Comparing curve A and C</u>
- The <span class="hi-green">reaction rate for curve C is <u>steeper</u></span> than curve A as the mass of $\ce{Mg(s)}$ of curve C is higher than curve A.
- <span class="hi-blue">More product is produced</span> as $\ce{Mg(s)}$ is the limiting reagent.

*Explaining effects of concentration from molecular level*:
- The <span class="hi-green">number of reactant particles in a unit volume increases</span> when the concentration is increased.
- The <span class="hi-blue">collision frequency</span> and hence the <span class="hi-blue">effective collision increases</span> per unit time.

> [!note]
> Changing only the volume of a reagent used (e.g. $\ce{HCl}$) without a change in its concentration results in the same initial rate of reaction.

> [!tip] Same volume of reaction mixture
> In some instances, the <u>total volume of the reaction mixture is kept the same between different trials</u>, with a higher volume of the reagent and a lower volume of water in different trials.
> 
> - To ensure <span class="hi-blue">fair comparisons</span> between trials.
> - To allow <span class="hi-blue">the volume change to represent the concentration change</span> of reactants.
> - To allow the <span class="hi-blue">concentration</span> of the reagent to be directly proportional to the <span class="hi-blue">volume</span> of the reagent used.

# Surface area of solid reactant
With a <u>solid reactant</u>, <span class="hi-green">a higher surface area results in a higher rate of reaction</span>.

Compare the reaction using granules and powder:
![[surface_area_rate.webp|600]]
- The <span class="hi-green">curve of the powdered reactant is steeper</span> than the lumped (/ granular) reactant, as the <span class="hi-blue">surface area</span> of the powdered form is higher than the lumped (/ granular) form.
- The collision frequency increases and hence the effective collision increases.

# Temperature of reaction
*See also: [[Maxwell-Boltzmann's distribution curve]]*

<span class="hi-green">When the <u>temperature</u> of the reaction increases, the <u>rate of reaction</u> increases</span>.

Consider the reaction with the following curves:
![[temperature_rate.webp|600]]
- The reactant particles <span class="hi-green">move faster and collide with each other more frequently</span>.
- More reactant particles have energy equal or greater than the <span class="hi-blue">activation energy</span>.
- The <span class="hi-blue">collision frequency</span> per unit time increases and hence the <span class="hi-blue">effective collision</span> increases.

# Presence of a catalyst
*See also: [[Catalysts]]*

- Catalysts provide an <span class="hi-green">alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy</span> required.
- More reactant particles have energy equal or greater than the activation energy.
- The <span class="hi-blue">effective collision</span> increases.

> [!note]
> The rate of reaction is independent of the amount of catalyst added.

## Autocatalysis
**Autocatalysis** refers to a reaction which produces a product that can act as the catalyst of the original reaction.

The rate of reaction will increase rapidly in the middle period of the reaction due to the production of catalytic product.
