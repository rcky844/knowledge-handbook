#### Concentration of reactant
Generally, a <u>higher concentration of reactants</u> results in a <u>higher rate of reaction</u>.

> [!tip]
> Some reactions are not affected by the concentration of reactants.

Consider the reaction: $\ce{Mg + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2}$

| Curve | $\ce{[HCl (aq)]}$ | $\text{Mass of }\ce{Mg}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A | $\pu{1.0 mol dm^-3}$ | $\pu{5g}$ |
| B | $\pu{0.5 mol dm^-3}$ | $\pu{5g}$ |
| C | $\pu{1.0 mol dm^-3}$ | $\pu{10g}$ |

**Comparison of reaction rates at different times:** (refer to curve A)
- The <span style="color: lightgreen">reaction rate at the beginning of reaction is the highest</span> as the <span style="color: aqua">initial concentration of the reactants is the highest</span>.
- The <span style="color: lightgreen">reaction rate then decrease progressively during the reaction</span> as the <span style="color: aqua">concentration of reactants decreases with time</span>.

**Comparison of reaction rates at different curves**:
<u>Comparing curve A and B</u>
- The <span style="color: lightgreen">reaction rate for curve A is <u>steeper</u></span> than curve B as the concentration of $\ce{HCl(aq)}$ of curve A is higher than curve B.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Curve A <u>levels off earlier</u></span> than that of curve B as the <span style="color: aqua">reaction completes earlier</span>.
- However, the <span style="color: orange">same volume of hydrogen gas is produced</span>, as $\ce{HCl}$ is in excess, while $\ce{Mg}$ is the limiting reagent.

<u>Comparing curve A and C</u>
- The <span style="color: lightgreen">reaction rate for curve C is <u>steeper</u></span> than curve A as the mass of $\ce{Mg(s)}$ of curve C is higher than curve A.
- <span style="color: orange">More product is produced</span> as $\ce{Mg(s)}$ is the limiting reagent.

**Explaining effects of concentration from molecular level**:
- The <span style="color: peachpuff">number of reactant particles in a unit volume increases</span> when the concentration is increased.
- The <span style="color: violet">collision frequency</span> and hence the <span style="color: violet">effective collision increases</span> per unit time.

> [!note]
> Changing only the volume of a reagent used (e.g. $\ce{HCl}$) without a change in its concentration results in the same initial rate of reaction.

> [!tip] Same volume of reaction mixture
> In some instances, the <u>total volume of the reaction mixture is kept the same between different trials</u>, with a higher volume of the reagent and a lower volume of water in different trials.

> - To ensure <span style="color: aqua">fair comparisons</span> between trials.
> - To allow <span style="color: aqua">the volume change to represent the concentration change</span> of reactants.
> - To allow the <span style="color: aqua">concentration</span> of the reagent to be directly proportional to the <span style="color: aqua">volume</span> of the reagent used.

#### Surface area of solid reactant
With a <span style="color: violet">solid reactant</span>, <span style="color: lightgreen">a higher surface area results in a higher rate of reaction</span>.

Compare the reaction using granules and powder:
![[surface_area_rate.webp|600]]
- The <span style="color: lightgreen">curve of the powdered reactant is steeper</span> than the lumped (/ granular) reactant, as the <span style="color: aqua">surface area of the powdered form is higher than the lumped (/ granular) form</span>.
- <span style="color: orange">The collision frequency increases and hence the effective collision increases.</span>

#### Temperature of reaction
*See also: [[Maxwell-Boltzmann's distribution curve]]*

<span style="color: lightgreen">When the <u>temperature</u> of the reaction increases, the <u>rate of reaction</u> increases</span>.

Consider the reaction with the following curves:
![[temperature_rate.webp|600]]
- The reactant particles <span style="color: lightgreen">move faster and collide with each other more frequently</span>.
- <span style="color: aqua">More reactant particles have energy equal or greater than the activation energy.</span>
- The <span style="color: violet">collision frequency</span> per unit time increases and hence the <span style="color: violet">effective collision</span> increases.

<!--![[temperature_rate1.webp|300]]-->

#### Presence of a catalyst
*See also: [[Catalysts]]*

- Catalysts provide an <span style="color: lightgreen">alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy</span> required.
- More reactant particles have energy equal or greater than the activation energy.
- The <span style="color: violet">effective collision</span> increases.

> [!note]
> The rate of reaction is independent of the amount of catalyst added.

##### Autocatalysis
**Autocatalysis** refers to a reaction which produces a product that can act as the catalyst of the original reaction.

The rate of reaction will increase rapidly in the middle period of the reaction due to the production of catalytic product.
