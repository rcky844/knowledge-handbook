# Primary cell
**Primary cell** refers to a chemical cell which is <span class="hi-green">non-rechargeable</span>.

| Properties | Zinc-carbon cell | Alkaline manganese cell | Silver oxide cell |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| **-ve electrode** | Zinc | Zinc | Zinc |
| **+ve electrode** | Carbon | Manganese(IV) oxide | Silver oxide |
| **Electrolyte** | Ammonium chloride | Potassium hydroxide | Potassium hydroxide |
| **Advantages** | Low cost | Steady voltage;<br>Good performance in high-drained devices | Lightweight, small size |
| **Limitations** | Poor performance in high-drained devices;<br>Output voltage decreases when discharged | More expensive than zinc-carbon cell | Most expensive |

# Secondary cell
**Secondary cell** refers to a chemical cell which is <span class="hi-green">rechargeable</span>.

| Properties | Lithium ion cell | Nickel metal hydride cell | Lead-acid accumulator |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| **Advantages** | High energy density | Good performance in high-drained devices | Constant voltage over discharge |
| **Limitations** | High initial cost | High initial cost | Heavy and bulky;<br>Lead is toxic<br>Conc. $\ce{H2SO4}$ is corrosive |
> [!note]
> - Dry cells refer to chemical cells which uses moist paste (paste with small amounts of electrolyte attached) as electrolyte.
> - Wet cells refer to chemical cells which uses a solution as the electrolyte.
>   (e.g. lead-acid accumulator)
