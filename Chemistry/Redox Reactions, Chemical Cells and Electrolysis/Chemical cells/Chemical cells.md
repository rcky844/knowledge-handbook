**Chemical cells** consists of redox reactions that occur <u>spontaneously</u>, converting chemical energy to electrical energy.
- There is <u>no need to connect a battery</u> into the set-up.
- There will be <u>electron flow</u> in the external circuit of the chemical cell.

> [!warning]
> - <span class="hi-green">Electrons only flow through the external circuit.</span> They do not flow through the electrolyte solution.
> - Current flow occurs in the reverse direction to the electron flow.
> - There is <span class="hi-green">no attraction between electrodes and ions</span> by charge.

The <u>voltage produced</u> by chemical cells are measured using <span class="hi-blue">voltmeter or multimeter</span>.

# Types of chemical cells
*Simple chemical cells*:
- [[Metal couple cells]]
- [[Lemon cells]]
- [[Two half-cells]]
- [[Concentration cells]]
- [[Daniell cell]]
- [[Electrolyte redox cell using inert electrodes]]

*Fuel cells*:
- [[Hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell]]
- [[Proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]
- [[Direct methanol fuel cell]]

> [!note]
> - Fuel cells are <span class="hi-blue">primary cells</span>.
> - They are not secondary cells as they <u>cannot be recharged</u>.
