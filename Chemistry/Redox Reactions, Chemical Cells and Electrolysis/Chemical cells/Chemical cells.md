**Chemical cells** consists of redox reactions that occur <u>spontaneously</u>, converting chemical energy to electrical energy.
- There is <u>no need to connect a battery</u> into the set-up.
- There will be <u>electron flow</u> in the external circuit of the chemical cell.

> **Note**:
> Current flow occurs in the reverse direction to the electron flow.

The <u>voltage produced</u> by chemical cells are measured using <span style="color: skyblue">voltmeter or multimeter</span>.

#### Types of chemical cells
**Simple chemical cells**:
- [[Metal couple cells]]
- [[Lemon cells]]
- [[Two-half cells]]
- [[Concentration cells]]
- [[Electrolyte redox cells using inert electrodes]]
- [[Daniell cell]]

**Fuel cells**:
- [[Hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell]]
- [[Proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]
- [[Direct methanol fuel cell]]

> **Note**:
> - Fuel cells are <span style="color: skyblue">primary cells</span>.
> - They are not secondary cells as they <u>cannot be recharged</u>.

#### Electrode arrangements
| Electrode | Reaction at electrode | Charge |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Cathode | Reduction | +ve electrode |
