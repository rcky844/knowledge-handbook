# Essay
*Example*: HKALE 2008 Paper 1 Q2(b)
With the help of chemical equations, state the working principle of hydrogen oxygen fuel cell.

- The principle of the fuel cell is based on the conversion of <u>chemical energy</u> released in the reaction $\ce{2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(ℓ)}$ to <u>electrical energy</u>.
- At anode, $\ce{H2(g)}$ is oxidized to $\ce{H2O(ℓ)}$:
  $\ce{2OH-(aq) + H2(g) -> 2H2O(ℓ) + 2e-}$
- At cathode, $\ce{O2(g)}$ is reduced to $\ce{OH-(aq)}$:
  $\ce{O2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) + 4e- -> 4OH-(aq)}$
- The concentrated $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$ acts as an electrolyte and provides the $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ for the anodic reaction.
- The porous electrodes allow the flow of materials in and our of the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell.
- The electrochemical reactions are catalysed by the platinum (/ nickel) in the electrode.

# Advantages and disadvantages
*Advantages*:
- High energy conversion efficiency.
- Can operate continuously if the flow of $\ce{H2(g)}$ and $\ce{O2(g)}$ can be maintained.
- Environmentally friendly as only water is produced in the reaction, which is not harmful.
- No noise pollution.

*Disadvantages*:
- Metals used as electrodes are expensive.
- Difficult to store and transfer hydrogen as it can cause explosions.
- Impure reactants causes the catalyst to become 'poisoned'.
- $\ce{H2(g)}$ used in fuel cell comes from the combustion of fossil fuel or electrolysis, causing pollution and using large amount of electricity.
