*Pre-context: [[Metal couple cells]]*

**Lemon cells** are simple chemical cells <u>using a lemon (or fresh potato) as an electrolyte</u>. They are very similar in nature to typical metal couple cells.

*Reason lemons / potatoes can act as an electrolyte*:
- They contain lemon juice / potato juice to act as an electrolyte.
- The juice contains $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions.
- The anions in the lemon cell mostly do not react.

*At cathode*:
- $\ce{2H+(aq) + 2e- -> H2(g)}$
- Colourless gas bubbles is given out.

*At anode*:
- $\ce{Mg(s) -> Mg^2+(aq) + 2e-}$
- $\ce{Mg(s)}$ gradually dissolves.
