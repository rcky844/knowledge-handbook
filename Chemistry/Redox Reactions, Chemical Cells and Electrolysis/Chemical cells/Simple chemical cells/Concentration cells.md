In this condition, there is a tendency that $\ce{[Cu^2+(aq)]}$ in each beaker becomes the same.

**At anode**:
- Electrode X reacts to give more $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ions, <u>oxidation occurs at electrode X</u>.
- $\ce{Cu(s) -> Cu^2+(aq) + 2e-}$

**At cathode**:
- $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ions are reduced at electrode Y, <u>reduction occurs at electrode Y</u>.
- $\ce{Cu^2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s)}$
