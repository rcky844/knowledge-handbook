**Inert electrodes** are electrodes that do not take part in the cell reactions.

**Examples**:
- Graphite (cannot be in high temperatures)
- Platinum (cannot contain halogens & halides)

**Properties of platinum**:
- Chemically inert
- Electrically conductive
- High corrosion resistance

The reactions are driven by the reducing agent and oxidizing agent in the electrolyte, so $\ce{H2O, H+, OH-}$ <u>can be neglected</u>.

**At anode**:
- $\ce{2I-(aq) -> I2(aq) + 2e-}$
- The solution near the anode turns brown.

**At cathode**:
- $\ce{Cr2O7^2-(aq) + 14H+(aq) + 6e- -> 2Cr^3+(aq) + 7H2O(ℓ)}$
- The solution near the cathode turns from orange to green.

**Overall equation**:
$\ce{6I-(aq) + Cr2O7^2-(aq) + 14H+(aq) → 3I2(g) + 2Cr^3+(aq) + 7H2O(ℓ)}$
