**Two half-cells** are chemical cells where the anode and cathode are separated into two half-cells.

![[half_cells.webp||350]]

**At anode**:
$\ce{Mg(s) -> Mg^2+(aq) + 2e-}$

**At cathode**:
$\ce{Ag+(aq) + e- -> Ag(s)}$

**Overall equation**:
$\ce{Mg(s) + 2Ag+(aq) â†’ Mg^2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)}$

#### Salt bridge
**Functions**:
- It <span style="color: lightgreen">completes the circuit</span> by <u>allowing ions to flow</u> from one half-cell to the other.
- It <span style="color: lightgreen">provides ions to balance the charges</span> in the electrolyte of the two half-cells.

> **Note**:
> Electrons always flow through the external circuit, but not the salt bridge.

**Production**:
- Soaking a <span style="color: skyblue">filter paper</span> in a saturated unreactive electrolyte.
  (e.g. $\ce{KNO3(aq)}$)

> **Note**:
> - The salt bridge cannot be made using species that react with the electrodes or electrolytes (e.g. by redox).
> - The salt bridge cannot be made using species that react with the electrolyte to form a precipitate (e.g. $\ce{AgNO3(aq)}$ as insoluble $\ce{Ag2SO4(s)}$ is formed, which blocks the circuit).
