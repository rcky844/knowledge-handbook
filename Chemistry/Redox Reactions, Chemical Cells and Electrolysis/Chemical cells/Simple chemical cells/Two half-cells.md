**Two half-cells** are chemical cells where the anode and cathode are separated into two half-cells.

![[half_cells.webp||350]]

*At anode*:
$\ce{Mg(s) -> Mg^2+(aq) + 2e-}$

*At cathode*:
$\ce{Ag+(aq) + e- -> Ag(s)}$

*Overall equation*:
$\ce{Mg(s) + 2Ag+(aq) â†’ Mg^2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)}$

# Salt bridge
*Functions*:
- It <span class="hi-green">completes the circuit</span> by <u>allowing ions to flow</u> from one half-cell to the other.
- It <span class="hi-green">provides ions to balance the charges</span> in the electrolyte of the two half-cells.

> [!warning]
> Electrons always flow through the external circuit, but not the salt bridge.

*Production*:
- Soaking a <span class="hi-blue">filter paper</span> in a saturated unreactive electrolyte.
  (e.g. $\ce{KNO3(aq)}$)

> [!warning]
> - The salt bridge cannot be made using species that react with the electrodes or electrolytes (e.g. by redox).
> - The salt bridge cannot be made using species that react with the electrolyte to form a precipitate (e.g. $\ce{AgNO3(aq)}$ as insoluble $\ce{Ag2SO4(s)}$ is formed, which blocks the circuit).
