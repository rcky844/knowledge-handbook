*At cathode*:
- $\ce{Cu^2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s)}$
- Copper of the container acts as the cathode.
- Colour of the $\ce{CuSO4(aq)}$ fades out.

*At anode*:
- $\ce{Zn(s) -> Zn^2+(aq) + 2e-}$
- Zinc strip slowly dissolves.

# Porous pot
*Functions*:
- It <span class="hi-green">prevents direct mixing and reaction</span> of the two electrolytes.
- It <span class="hi-green">completes the circuit</span> by allowing ions to move across the two electrolytes through its <u>small holes</u>.
