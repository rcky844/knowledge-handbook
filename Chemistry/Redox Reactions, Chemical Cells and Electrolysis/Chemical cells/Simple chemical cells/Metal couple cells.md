**Metal couple cells** are simple chemical cells consisting of <u>two different metals</u>, <u>one is more reactive while one is less reactive</u>.
- An <span class="hi-blue">external circuit</span> of an electrical wire connects the two electrodes.
- An <span class="hi-blue">electrolyte</span> is a substance that <span class="hi-green">contains mobile ions to conduct electricity</span> when <span class="hi-green"><u>in molten or aqueous states</u></span>.
- Oxidation occurs at the more reactive electrode, while reduction occurs at the less reactive electrode.

Consider the following chemical cell:
![[metal_couple_cell_mg+cu+cuso4.webp|250]]
*-ve electrode* (anode / oxidation):
- **Species that can undergo oxidation**: $\ce{Mg(s)}$, $\ce{OH-(aq)}$
- **Half equation**: $\ce{Mg(s) -> Mg^2+(aq) + 2e-}$
- **Explanation**: $\ce{Mg(s)}$ is a stronger reducing agent than $\ce{OH-(aq)}$.
  (Higher in E.C.S. position)

*+ve electrode* (cathode / reduction):
- **Species that can undergo reduction**: $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$, $\ce{H+(aq)}$
- **Half equation**: $\ce{Cu^2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s)}$
- **Explanation**: $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ is a stronger oxidizing agent than $\ce{H+(aq)}$.
  (Lower in E.C.S. position)

*Observations*:
- $\ce{Mg(s)}$ dissolves gradually.
- Reddish brown solid deposits on the $\ce{Cu(s)}$ cathode.

*Electron flow and current flow*:
- Electron flows from $\ce{Mg(s)}$ to $\ce{Cu(s)}$ through the external circuit.
- Current flows from $\ce{Cu(s)}$ to $\ce{Mg(s)}$ through the external circuit.

> <span class="hi-green">Electrons only flow through the external circuit.</span> They do not flow through the electrolyte solution.

## Problems
1. **Displacement reaction occurs between $\ce{Mg}$ strip and $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ions in the solution.**
   The electrons are directly transferred from $\ce{Mg}$ to $\ce{Cu^2+}$ and they do not flow through the external circuit. This creates a waste of electrons.

2. **Discharge of $\ce{Mg(s)}$ creates a build up of positive ions surrounding the anode.**
   This hinders the release of electrons from the $\ce{Mg(s)}$ strip through the external circuit.

3. **Discharge of $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ causes the conc. of negative ions to relatively increase.**
   This hinders the acceptance of electrons from external circuit to the $\ce{Cu(s)}$ strip.

In order to provide a more steady voltage, the following problems has to be solved:
- <span class="hi-green">Direct reaction between electrodes in the electrolyte</span>
- <span class="hi-green">Imbalance (excess) charges in the chemical cell</span>

# Voltage comparison
The **cell voltage** of a chemical cell can be increased by increasing the difference in E.C.S. position between two metal electrodes.

For the above cell:
- If $\ce{Mg(s)}$ electrode is replaced by $\ce{Al(s)}$ electrode, voltage decreases.
  The differences of the metals in E.C.S. decreases.
- If $\ce{Cu(s)}$ electrode is replaced by $\ce{Ag(s)}$ electrode, voltage increases.
  The differences of the metals in E.C.S. increases.

*Positive voltage and negative voltage*:
When the terminals of the voltmeter is connected in the <u>reverse</u> of the polarity of the chemical cell, the voltmeter will show negative voltage.

# Metal couple setup
![[metal_couple_setup.webp|500]]
This **metal couple setup** can be used to compare the reactivity of metals.
- For positive voltage, the metal X should be the negative electrode (anode, oxidation), while the copper should be the positive electrode (cathode, reduction).
- The larger the differences in tendencies between the metal couples to form ions <u>(further apart in the ECS)</u>, the <u>larger the reading of the value in voltage</u>.
