**Metal couple cells** are simple chemical cells consisting of <u>two different metals</u>, <u>one is more reactive while one is less reactive</u>.
- An <span style="color: skyblue">external circuit</span> of an electrical wire connects the two electrodes.
- An <span style="color: skyblue">electrolyte</span> is a substance which contains mobile ions to conduct electricity in molten or aqueous states.
- Oxidation occurs at the more reactive electrode, while reduction occurs at the less reactive electrode.

Consider the following chemical cell:
![[metal_couple_cell_mg+cu+cuso4.webp|250]]
**-ve electrode** (anode / oxidation):
- **Species that can undergo oxidation**: $\ce{Mg(s)}$, $\ce{OH-(aq)}$
- **Half equation**: $\ce{Mg(s) -> Mg^2+(aq) + 2e-}$
- **Explanation**: $\ce{Mg(s)}$ is a stronger reducing agent than $\ce{OH-(aq)}$.
  (Higher in E.C.S. position)

**+ve electrode** (cathode / reduction):
- **Species that can undergo reduction**: $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$, $\ce{H+(aq)}$
- **Half equation**: $\ce{Cu^2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s)}$
- **Explanation**: $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ is a stronger oxidizing agent than $\ce{H+(aq)}$.
  (Lower in E.C.S. position)

**Observations**:
- $\ce{Mg(s)}$ dissolves gradually.
- Reddish brown solid deposits on the $\ce{Cu(s)}$ cathode.

**Electron flow and current flow**:
- Electron flows from $\ce{Mg(s)}$ to $\ce{Cu(s)}$ through the external circuit.
- Current flows from $\ce{Cu(s)}$ to $\ce{Mg(s)}$ through the external circuit.

#### Voltage comparison
The **cell voltage** of a chemical cell can be increased by increasing the difference in E.C.S. position between two metal electrodes.

For the above cell:
- If $\ce{Mg(s)}$ electrode is replaced by $\ce{Al(s)}$ electrode, voltage decreases.
  The differences of the metals in E.C.S. decreases.
- If $\ce{Cu(s)}$ electrode is replaced by $\ce{Ag(s)}$ electrode, voltage increases.
  The differences of the metals in E.C.S. increases.

**Positive voltage and negative voltage**:
When the terminals of the voltmeter is connected in the <u>reverse</u> of the polarity of the chemical cell, the voltmeter will show negative voltage.
