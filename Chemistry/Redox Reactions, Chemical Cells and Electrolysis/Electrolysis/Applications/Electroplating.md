*Details*:
- The <span style="color: skyblue">electrolyte</span> must contain the <span style="color: violet">salt of the plating metal</span>.
- The object to be plated must be a <span style="color: violet">cathode</span>, as the metallic ion has to <u>undergo reduction</u> to be plated.
- The anode can be graphite or other inert electrodes, and must not be a metal.
