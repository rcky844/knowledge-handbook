Consider the <span style="color: violet">electrolysis of dilute or concentrated sodium chloride solution</span> using <span style="color: skyblue">graphite electrodes</span>:
![[electrolysis_conc_nacl.webp|400]]

**At anode**:
- Both $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ and $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the anode.
- Since $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ has a <span style="color: aqua">higher concentration</span> than $\ce{OH-(aq)}$, $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ ions are <span style="color: lightgreen">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{Cl2(g)}$.
- *Half equation*: $\ce{2Cl-(aq) -> Cl2(g) + 2e-}$
- *Observation*: Greenish yellow gas is formed at anode.'

**At cathode**:
- Both $\ce{H+(aq)}$ and $\ce{Na+(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the cathode.
- Since $\ce{H+(aq)}$ has a lower ECS position than $\ce{Na+(aq)}$ ions, $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are <span style="color: lightgreen">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{H2(g)}$ at cathode.
- *Half equation*: $\ce{2H+(aq) + 2e- -> H2(g)}$
- *Observation*: Colourless gas bubbles are given out at cathode.

**Overall equation**: $\ce{2HCl(aq) ->  H2(g) + Cl2(g)}$

**Points to note**:
- Mole ratio of $\ce{H2(g) : Cl2(g)}$ = Volume ratio of $\ce{H2(g) : Cl2(g)}$ = $1:1$
- The volume of chlorine collected may be significantly smaller than the theoretical volume, as part of the $\ce{Cl2(g)}$ dissolves / reacts with water.
  ↪️ $\ce{Cl2(g) + H2O(ℓ) <=> HCl(aq) + HOCl(aq)}$

**Observation with universal indicator**:
*Anode*:
- As $\ce{Cl2(g)}$ formed reacts with water: $\ce{Cl2(g) + H2O(ℓ) <=> HCl(aq) + HOCl(aq)}$
- The solution turns red (due to the production of $\ce{H+(aq)}$) than beaches it / turns colourless.

*Cathode*:
- As $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are preferentially discharged, $\ce{H+(aq)} < \ce{OH-(aq)}$.
- The solution turns blue.
