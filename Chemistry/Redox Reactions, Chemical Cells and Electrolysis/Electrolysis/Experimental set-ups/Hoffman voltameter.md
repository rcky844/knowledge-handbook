**Hoffman voltameter** is used in the electrolysis of <span class="hi-blue">acidified water</span>.
- Although water undergoes self-ionization to give $\ce{H+(aq)}$ and $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions, the amount of ions is too small and this makes water a poor electrical conductor.
- Water is acidified by <span class="hi-green">adding sulphuric acid</span> to <span style="color: aqua">increase the electrical conductivity</span>.

*At anode*:
- Both $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ and $\ce{SO4^2-(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the anode.
- Since $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ has a higher ECS position than $\ce{SO4^2-(aq)}$, $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions are <span class="hi-green">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{O2(g)}$ at anode.
- **Half equation**: $\ce{4OH-(aq) -> O2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) + 4e-}$
- **Observation**: Colourless gas bubbles are given out at electrode.

*At cathode*:
- $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the cathode.
- $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are <span class="hi-green">discharged</span> to give $\ce{H2(g)}$.
- **Half equation**: $\ce{2H+(aq) + 2e- -> H2(g)}$
- **Observation**: Colourless gas bubbles are given out at electrode.

*Overall equation*: $\ce{2H2O(ℓ) -> 2H2(g) + O2(g)}$

*Points to note*:
- The sulphuric acid in the electrolyte becomes more concentrated as water is consumed / decomposed during the process.
- Mole ratio of $\ce{H2(g) : O2(g)}$ = Volume ratio of $\ce{H2(g) : O2(g)}$ = $2:1$
- At anode, the discharge of $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ causes $\ce{[H+(aq)]}$ to increase and the environment becomes relatively acidic.
- At cathode, the discharge of $\ce{H+(aq)}$ causes $\ce{[OH-(aq)]}$ to increase and the environment becomes relatively alkaline.
