**Set-up A** (carbon electrodes):
![[electrolysis_graphite_cathode_anode.webp|400]]
**At anode**:
- Both $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ and $\ce{SO4^2-(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the anode.
- Since $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ion has a higher ECS position than $\ce{SO4^2-(aq)}$, $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions are <span class="hi-green">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{O2(g)}$.
- *Half equation*: $\ce{4OH-(aq) -> O2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) + 4e-}$
- *Observation*: Colourless gas bubbles are given out at anode.

**At cathode**:
- Both $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ and $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the cathode.
- Since $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ion has a lower ECS position than $\ce{H+(aq)}$, $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ions are <span class="hi-green">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{Cu(s)}$.
- *Half equation*: $\ce{Cu^2+(aq) +2e- -> Cu(s)}$
- *Observation*: Reddish brown solid deposits on the cathode.

**Set-up B** (carbon cathode and copper anode):
![[electrolysis_graphite_cathode_cu_anode.webp|400]]

**At anode**:
- Both $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ and $\ce{SO4^2-(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the anode.
- As copper is used as anode / $\ce{Cu(s)}$ is higher than $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ in ECS, copper is preferentially discharged to give $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ions.
- *Half equation*: $\ce{Cu(s) -> Cu^2+(aq) + 2e-}$
- *Observation*: Copper gradually dissolves

**At cathode**:
- Both $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ and $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the cathode.
- Since $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ion has a lower ECS position than $\ce{H+(aq)}$, $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ions are <span class="hi-green">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{Cu(s)}$.
- *Half equation*: $\ce{Cu^2+(aq) +2e- -> Cu(s)}$
- *Observation*: Reddish brown solid deposits on the cathode.

> [!note] Observations
> - Anode dissolves.
> - Reddish brown solid deposits on cathode.
> - Colour intensity of $\ce{CuSO4(aq)}$ solution remains the same as $\ce{[Cu^2+(aq)]}$ remains unchanged. (Rate of formation = Rate of consumption)
