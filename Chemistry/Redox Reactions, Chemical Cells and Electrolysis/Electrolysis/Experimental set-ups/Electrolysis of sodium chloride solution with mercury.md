**Design of set-up**:
- A <span style="color: skyblue">U-shaped tube</span> is used as <span style="color: violet">mercury is a liquid</span> at room conditions.
- The <span style="color: skyblue">layer of water</span> on mercury is to <span style="color: lightgreen">prevent the mercury from vaporization</span>.
- The <span style="color: skyblue">plastic cover on the electrical wire</span> is to <span style="color: lightgreen">prevent the electrolysis of water</span>.

**At cathode**:
- Both $\ce{H+(aq)}$ and $\ce{Na+(aq)}$ are attracted towards the cathode.
- As mercury is used as a cathode, it favours the discharge to give $\ce{Na/Hg}$ (/ $\ce{Na}$).
  ↪️ *Half equation*: $\ce{Na+(aq) + e- + Hg(ℓ) -> Na/Hg(ℓ)}$
- The $\ce{Na/Hg(ℓ)}$ dissolves in water to give $\ce{Hg(ℓ)}$, $\ce{H2(g)}$ and $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$.
  ↪️ *Equation*: $\ce{2Na/Hg(ℓ) + 2H2O(ℓ) -> 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + 2Hg(ℓ)}$

**At anode**:
- Both $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ and $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the anode.
- As $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ has a <span style="color: lightgreen">higher concentration</span> than $\ce{OH-(aq)}$, $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ is preferentially discharged to give $\ce{Cl2(g)}$.
- *Half equation*: $\ce{2Cl-(aq) -> Cl2(g) + 2e-}$
- *Observation*: Greenish yellow gas is formed at anode.

**Overall equation**: $\ce{NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(ℓ) -> 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + Cl2(g)}$

**Example**:
The following diagram shows the set-up of an experiment.
![[electrolysis_mercury_ce11.webp|600]]
After starting the experiment for some time, the tap of the separating funnel is opened to run some mercury into the beaker containing water with phenolphthalein.

(a) Explain whether carbon rod is the anode or the cathode.
- It is an anode.
- Oxidation occurs around the carbon rod.

(b) Write the ionic half-equations for the reactions that occurs at the carbon rod and the mercury electrode respectively.
- Carbon rod: $\ce{2Cl-(aq) -> Cl2(g) + 2e-}$
- Mercury electrode: $\ce{Na+(aq) + e- + Hg(ℓ) -> Na/Hg(ℓ)}$

(c) With the aid of a chemical equation, explain the observable change when the mercury is run into the beaker.
- $\ce{2Na/Hg(ℓ) + 2H2O(ℓ) -> 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + 2Hg(ℓ)}$
- The solution turns from colourless to pink due to the formation of alkaline $\ce{NaOH(aq)}$.
