Consider the <span style="color: violet">electrolysis of very dilute sodium chloride solution</span> using <span class="hi-blue">graphite electrodes</span>:
![[electrolysis_dil_nacl.webp|250]]

*At anode*:
- Both $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ and $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the anode.
- Since $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ has a higher ECS position than $\ce{Cl-(aq)}$ ions, $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions are <span class="hi-green">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{O2(g)}$ at anode.
- **Half equation**: $\ce{4OH-(aq) -> O2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) + 4e-}$
- **Observation**: Colourless gas bubbles are given out at anode.

*At cathode*:
- Both $\ce{H+(aq)}$ and $\ce{Na+(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the cathode.
- Since $\ce{H+(aq)}$ has a lower ECS position than $\ce{Na+(aq)}$ ions, $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are <span class="hi-green">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{H2(g)}$ at cathode.
- **Half equation**: $\ce{2H+(aq) + 2e- -> H2(g)}$
- **Observation**: Colourless gas bubbles are given out at cathode.

*Overall equation*: $\ce{2H2O(ℓ) -> 2H2(g) + O2(g)}$
