Consider the <span class="hi-green">electrolysis of dilute copper(II) sulphate solution</span> using <span class="hi-blue">graphite electrodes</span>:
![[electrolysis_cuso4.webp|400]]

*At anode*:
- Both $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ and $\ce{SO4^2-(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the anode.
- Since $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ion has a higher ECS position than $\ce{SO4^2-(aq)}$, $\ce{OH-(aq)}$ ions are <span class="hi-green">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{O2(g)}$.
- **Half equation**: $\ce{4OH-(aq) -> O2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) + 4e-}$
- **Observation**: Colourless gas bubbles are given out at anode.

*At cathode*:
- Both $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ and $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are attracted towards the cathode.
- Since $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ion has a lower ECS position than $\ce{H+(aq)}$, $\ce{Cu^2+(aq)}$ ions are <span class="hi-green">preferentially discharged</span> to give $\ce{Cu(s)}$.
- **Half equation**: $\ce{Cu^2+(aq) +2e- -> Cu(s)}$
- **Observation**: Reddish brown solid deposits on the cathode.

*Overall equation*: $\ce{2Cu^2+(aq) + 4OH-(aq) -> 2Cu(s) + O2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ)}$
- The electrolyte gradually becomes acidic / $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$.

> [!note]
> $\ce{Cu(OH)2(s)}$ is not formed due to low concentration of $\ce{OH-(aq)}$.
