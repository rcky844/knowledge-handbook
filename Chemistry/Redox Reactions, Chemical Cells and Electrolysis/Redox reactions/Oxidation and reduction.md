#### Determining oxidations and reductions
1. **Gain or loss of electrons**
   $\ce{Zn(s) + Cu^2+(aq) -> Zn^2+(aq) + Cu(s)}$
	- $\ce{Zn(s) -> Zn^2+(aq) + 2e-}$
	  Loss of electrons → Reducing agent
	- $\ce{Cu^2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s)}$
	  Gain of electrons → Oxidizing agent

2. **Gain or loss of oxygen atoms**
   $\ce{C(s) + O2(g) -> CO2(g)}$
	- Carbon gains oxygen atoms, so it is oxidized.
	- Oxygen is reduced.

3. **Gain or loss of hydrogen atoms**
   $\ce{2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(ℓ)}$
	- Oxygen gains hydrogen atoms, so it is reduced.
	- Hydrogen is oxidized.

4. **Increase or decrease of oxidation number (O.N.)**
	- Free elements have O.N. = 0.
	- O.N. of simple monoatomic ions is equal to its charge.
	- Group I and II metal ions have O.N. = 1 and O.N. = 2 respectively.
	- O.N. of hydrogen is +1, except for <u>hydride ions which has O.N. = -1</u>
	- O.N. of halide ions is usually -1.
	- O.N. of oxygen is -2, except for hydrogen peroxide ($\ce{H2O2}$) which has O.N. = -1.
	- Sum of O.N. = 0 for neutral compounds.
	- Some elements have variable O.N. (e.g. C, N, S and [[transition metals]])

#### Describing O.N. changes
**Answer pattern**:
The O.N. of {atom} is (increased / decreased) from \_\_ in {species A} to \_\_ in {species B}.

#### Determining redox reactions
A reaction must be a redox reaction when there is a change in O.N. of any chemical species.

Some types of reactions are <u>not redox reactions</u>:
- Neutralization
- Precipitation
