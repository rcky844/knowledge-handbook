*Arrangement*:
- The higher the position in the E.C.S., the species would like to undergo oxidation more.
- The lower the position in the E.C.S., the species would like to undergo reduction more.

*Deducing feasibility of redox reactions*:
By the E.C.S., the reactants should be located in an anti-clockwise manner for a redox reaction to occur.

For example, $\ce{Mg(s)}$ and $\ce{Al^3+}$:
$\ce{Mg(s)}$ is a stronger R.A. than $\ce{Al^3+(aq)}$.

> [!note]
> - Focus on the main chemical species involved, and balance equations *in situ*.
> - To merge two half equations, focus on the combined O.N. of the main chemical species, multiple the reactants by the L.C.M.

# Redox reactions involving halogens
Consider the [[periodic table]], reactivity of [[Group VII elements|halogens]] decreases down the group. This means they become weaker O.A. down the group.

The higher up in the group, the more electronegative is the halogen (tends to attract electrons), the more likely for it to undergo reduction.
