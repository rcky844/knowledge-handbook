**Rusting** is a chemical reaction that results in the <span class="hi-green">corrosion of iron</span>. Both oxygen and water are required in order for rusting to occur.

Consider the following experiment:
![[rusting_exp.webp|600]]

In tube A:
- There is oxygen but no water.
- Anhydrous calcium chloride absorbs water in air.
↪️ Rusting does not occur.

In tube B:
- There is water but no oxygen in water.
- Boiling the distilled water dries away dissolved oxygen, and the oil layer on top prevents air from dissolving in water again.
↪️ Rusting does not occur.

In tube C:
- There is both water and oxygen.
- Distilled water contains dissolved air.
↪️ Rusting occurs.

In tube D:
- There is water, oxygen and dissolved ions.
- Sea water contains dissolved air and ions, which increases the electrical conductivity and further speeds up rusting.
↪️ Rusting occurs, and faster than in tube C.

# Chemistry of rusting

Upon rusting, iron would turn to rust. Rust is hydrated iron(III) oxide: $\ce{Fe2O3 . nH2O (s)}$

The overall chemical equation for rusting is:
$\ce{4Fe (s) + 3O2 (g) + 2nH2O (ℓ) -> 2Fe2O3 . nH2O (s)}$

> [!note]
> Rusting is a [[Redox Reactions, Chemical Cells and Electrolysis|redox reaction]].

## Reaction of iron
Iron undergoes oxidation and loses electrons:
$\ce{Fe (s) -> Fe^2+ (aq) + 2e-}$
$\ce{Fe^2+ (aq) -> Fe^3+ (aq) + e-}$

> [!note]
> Iron will not be directly oxidised to give iron(III) ion:
> $\ce{Fe (s) -> Fe^3+ (aq) + 3e-}$

## Reaction of oxygen and water
Oxygen and water gain electrons to become hydroxide ion.
$\ce{O2 (g) + 2H2O (ℓ) + 4e- -> 4OH- (aq)}$

# Nature of rust
Rust ($\ce{Fe2O3 . nH2O (s)}$) is a <span class="hi-blue">reddish brown solid</span>.
- **Rust does not attach firmly on the iron metal.**
  <span class="hi-green">It flakes off easily and exposes the inner iron</span>.

- **The rust is also permeable to oxygen and water in air.**
  Even if the rust does not flake off, oxygen and water can <span class="hi-green">penetrate and contact the inner iron</span>.

# Rust indicator
**Rust indicator** is an aqueous solution potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) ($\ce{K3[Fe(CN)6]}$) and phenolphthalein.
- Addition of $\ce{NaCl (aq)}$ to the rust indicator can speed up rusting by increasing electrical conductivity.

Consider the following experimental set-up:
![[rusting_indicator_iron.webp|300]]
When rusting occurs:
- <span class="hi-blue">Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III)</span> turns blue for $\ce{Fe^2+ (aq)}$.
- <span class="hi-blue">Phenolphthalein</span> turns pink for $\ce{OH- (aq)}$.

However, if the iron nail is replaced by other metals such as zinc:
![[rusting_indicator_zinc.webp|300]]
- Blue colour will not appear as there is no $\ce{Fe^2+ (aq)}$.
  Only $\ce{Zn^2+ (aq)}$ is produced.
- Pink colour still appear for $\ce{OH- (aq)}$ produced.

# Factors affecting speed of rusting
## Acidic pollutants
Acids speed up the rusting of iron. $\ce{H+ (aq)}$ in the acid can react with $\ce{Fe (s)}$ to speed up the formation of $\ce{Fe^2+ (aq)}$.
↪️ $\ce{Fe(s) + 2H+(aq) → Fe2+(aq) + H2(g)}$

> [!note]
> - Normal rainwater is acidic as it contains carbonic acid. It can speed up rusting.
> - Acid rain contains dissolved $\ce{SO2}$ and $\ce{NO_x}$, which can form acids and increases the rate of rusting. This can happen in industrial areas.

> [!note]
> Alkaline solution will not speed up rusting, but inhibit rusting in contrast. The $\ce{OH- (aq)}$ ions in an alkaline solution shifts the equilibrium position of the following reaction to the reactant side.
> 
> $\ce{O2 (g) + 2H2O (ℓ) + 4e- <=> 4OH- (aq)}$

## Soluble ionic compounds
- Soluble ionic compounds contain mobile ions, which increase the electrical conductivity of substances in the environment.
- Since rusting involve electron transfer, soluble ionic compounds speed up rusting.

> [!note]
> Iron objects near sea will rust faster since seawater contains salts, which are soluble ionic compound.

## High temperature
Higher temperature increases the rate of chemical reaction.

> [!note]
> Iron-made car exhaust pipes rusts easily since they become hot when the cars are running.

## Attachment to less reactive metals
- Iron loses electrons more readily than the less reactive metal.
- When iron is attached to a less reactive metal (e.g. tin and copper), rusting speeds up.

## Scratched, bent or sharp area of an iron-made object
- A sharp, scratched or bent object has a larger surface area.
- When an iron object is sharp, or it is scratched or bent, rusting speeds up.
