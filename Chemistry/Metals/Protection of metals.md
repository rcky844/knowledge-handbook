> This page mainly discusses the protection of iron.

The methods to prevent rusting are made in accordance with one of the following chemical properties:
- To <span class="hi-green">prevent contact of iron to oxygen and water</span> in air
- To <span class="hi-green">prevent lost of electrons</span> in iron

# Coating with paint / plastic / oil / grease
A protective layer has to be completely coated on an iron made object. This prevents the contact of iron to oxygen and water in air.
- **Coating with paint**
  Cheap way to protect iron made objects in bridges, car bodies and fences.

- **Coating with plastic**
  More expansive than paint, used in coat hangers and paper clips.

- **Coating with oil and grease**
  Used in moving parts of machines. It can also serve as a lubricant.

> [!tip] Protection of moving parts
> - A machine should be oiled from time to time, as the oil will rub off and dirt would stick to the oil or grease.
> - Paint or plastic should not be used on moving parts, as it would be scratched off easily.

# Electroplating
*Main article: [[Electroplating]]*
**Electroplating** is a chemical process which uses electrolysis to place a metal onto the iron made object.

Chromium and copper are commonly used as plating metals as they give a shiny appearance. However, this method is expensive.

## Coating with another metal
In **tin-plating**, the iron surface is <u>completely</u> coated by tin.
- Tin prevents iron from contacting oxygen and water in air. Tin metal is corrosion resistant as it forms a protective oxide layer on the surface.
- Tin-plating is widely used in food cans since tin and tin ions are non-poisonous.

> [!note]
> Zinc ions are poisonous, they are not used for coating food cans.

- When the tin metal is incomplete (e.g. being scratched), part of the iron will be exposed. Since tin is less reactive than iron, and iron is now in contact with tin, iron will rust even faster than without contacting tin.
  ↪️ Therefore, tin-plated food can should not be consumed when it is scratched or deformed.

## Galvanization
**Galvanization** is <u>zinc-plating</u>, zinc loses electrons more readily than iron to prevent rusting.

# Sacrificial protection
By <u>attaching a more reactive metal (e.g. zinc)</u>, the more reactive metal loses electrons more readily than iron. Therefore, iron will not lose electrons and will not rust.

The blocks of metal used in protecting iron needs to be replaced from time to time.

*Examples*:
- **Attaching zinc blocks to ship hulls**
  Most ships are made of steel and contains iron. Zinc blocks are attached to the ship hull to prevent iron from rusting.

- **Magnesium blocks connected to underground pipelines**
  Some underground water pipes are made of iron. Magnesium blocks are attached to the underground pipelines to prevent iron from rusting.

# Alloying
An **alloy** is a mixture formed by meting <span class="hi-green">two or more elements</span> (e.g. carbon and chromium) together, in which <span class="hi-green">at least one of them is a metal</span>.

*Example*:
- **Stainless steel** is an alloy of iron made by mixing iron with specific amounts of <span class="hi-blue">carbon, chromium and nickel</span>.

However, this method is the most expensive method.

> [!tip] Strength of alloys
> - The introduction of other elements <span class="hi-green">disturbs the regular arrangement of metals</span> in its [[giant metallic structure]].
> - The metallic ions <span class="hi-green">cannot slide over each other easily</span> when force is applied.

# Cathodic protection
![[metal_cathodic_protection.webp|500]]

In **cathodic protection**, the <span class="hi-blue">negative terminal (cathode)</span> of a battery or power supply is <span class="hi-green">connected to the iron object</span>, providing electrons to the object and preventing the formation of $\ce{Fe^2+}$ ions.
