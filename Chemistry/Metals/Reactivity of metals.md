> [!note]
> - The colour observed may correspond to the colours in [[flame test]] due to the presence of metallic ions in their oxides.
> - Metals form potassium to iron burn, while metals from lead to mercury does not burn.
> - Magnesium metal itself produces a characteristic colour when burnt.

# Reaction with cold water

| Metal | Observations | Chemical equation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Potassium | - burn with lilac flame<br>- melt to form a silvery ball<br>- hissing sound<br>- colourless gas bubble is given out | $\ce{2K (s) + 2H2O (ℓ) -> 2KOH (aq) + H2 (g)}$ |
| Sodium | - burn with golden yellow flame<br>- melt to form a silvery ball<br>- hissing sound<br>- colourless gas bubble is given out | $\ce{2Na (s) + 2H2O (ℓ) -> 2NaOH (aq) + H2 (g)}$ |
| Calcium | - sink into water<br>- colourless gas bubble is given out | $\ce{Ca (s) + 2H2O (ℓ) -> Ca(OH)2 (s/aq) + H2(g)}$ |

*Experiment for reaction of calcium*:
The reaction between calcium and water is least vigorous than potassium and sodium, its reaction is commonly carried out:

# Reaction with steam

| Metal | Observations | Chemical equation |

| Magnesium | - burn with white light<br>- white powder is formed | $\ce{Mg (s) + H2O (g) -> MgO (s) + H2 (g)}$ |

# Reaction with dilute acids (Ca - Pb)
*General observable changes*:
- **Metal dissolves gradually** (due to formation of soluble metallic ions)
- **Colourless gas bubbles is given out**

*Chemical equation*: (example with zinc)
- $\ce{Zn (s) + 2HCl (aq) -> ZnCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)}$
- $\ce{Zn (s) + H2SO4 (aq) -> ZnSO4 (aq) + H2 (g)}$

*Special cases*:
- **Calcium**: $\ce{Ca (s) + H2SO4 (aq) -> CaSO4 (s) + H2 (g)}$
- **Lead**: $\ce{Pb (s) + 2HCl (aq) -> PbCl2 (s) + H2 (g)}$ / $\ce{Pb (s) + H2SO4 (aq) -> PbSO4 (s) + H2 (g)}$

> [!tip]
> Reaction feasibility and products are based on the dilute acid used.
> 
> Some metallic ions ([[Salts#Solubility of salts|list]]) form insoluble solids with the acid. Their reactions stops quickly as insoluble substances form a layer surrounding the metal, which prevents further reaction.
> 
> Dilute $\ce{HNO3}$ produces $\ce{NO(g)}$ when reacting with metals.

> [!note]
> <u>Very dilute</u> $\ce{HNO3 (aq)}$ can be used to form soluble substances with calcium and lead.
> ↪ $\ce{Pb (s) + 2HNO3 (aq) -> Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + H2 (g)}$

# Displacement reaction
**Displacement reaction** is a reaction between a more reactive metal species and a less reactive metallic ion containing solution. It can be used to deduce the reactivity of metals.

## Aqueous displacement reaction
*Example*:
![[aq_displacement_agcu.webp|500]]
- **Chemical equation**: $\ce{Cu (s) + 2AgNO3 (aq) -> Cu(NO3)2 (aq) + 2 Ag (s)}$
- **Ionic equation**: $\ce{Cu (s) + 2Ag+ (aq) -> Cu^2+ (aq) + 2Ag (s)}$
- **Observable changes**:
	- The copper dissolves gradually.
	- The solution turns from colourless to blue.
	- Silvery solid deposits on the copper.
- **Explanation**: Copper is more reactive than silver, copper loses electrons more readily than silver.

## Solid displacement reaction
*Example*:
- **Chemical equation**: $\ce{Zn (s) + CuO (s) ->[heat] ZnO (s) + Cu (s)}$
- **Observable changes**: Reddish brown solid is formed.
- **Explanation**: As zinc is more reactive than copper, zinc will lose electrons more readily than copper.
