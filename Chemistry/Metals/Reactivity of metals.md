The reactivity of different metals is compared by three factors:
- **Lowest temperature at which the reaction starts.**
  A more reactive metal starts to react at a lower temperature.

- **Rate of reaction**
  A more reactive metal reacts faster.

- **Amount of heat released during reaction**
  A more reactive metal releases more heat during reaction.

Metals react with oxygen, steam, liquid water, acids and they have displacement reaction.

#### Reactions with oxygen in air under heating (K - Hg)

| Metal | Observations | Chemical equation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Potassium | - burn with a lilac flame<br>- white powder is formed | $\ce{4K (s) + O2 (g) -> 2K2O (s)}$ |

| Zinc | - burn to form a powder, yellow when hot, white when cold | $\ce{2Zn (s) + O2 (g) -> 2ZnO (s)}$ |
| Iron | - burn with yellow sparks<br>- black powder is formed | $\ce{3Fe (s) + 2O2 (g) -> Fe3O4 (s)}$ |

| Copper | - form a black power (on surface) | $\ce{2Cu (s) + O2 (g) -> 2CuO (s)}$ |
| Mercury | - form a red powder (on surface) | $\ce{2Hg (ℓ) + O2 (g) -> 2HgO (s)}$ |
| Silver, platinum, gold | - does not react | N/A |

> [!note]
> - The colour that appears to correspond to the colours in [[flame test]]. This is due to the formation of oxides with their ions. The metals themselves do not produce flame colours under heating.
> - Metals form potassium to iron burn, while metals from lead to mercury does not burn.

#### Reactions with cold water (K - Ca)

| Metal | Observations | Chemical equation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Potassium | - burn with lilac flame<br>- melt to form a silvery ball<br>- hissing sound<br>- colourless gas bubble is given out | $\ce{2K (s) + 2H2O (ℓ) -> 2KOH (aq) + H2 (g)}$ |
| Sodium | - burn with golden yellow flame<br>- melt to form a silvery ball<br>- hissing sound<br>- colourless gas bubble is given out | $\ce{2Na (s) + 2H2O (ℓ) -> 2NaOH (aq) + H2 (g)}$ |
| Calcium | - sink into water<br>- colourless gas bubble is given out | $\ce{Ca (s) + 2H2O (ℓ) -> Ca(OH)2 (s/aq) + H2(g)}$ |

Since the <u>reaction between calcium and water is least vigorous</u> in the above reactions, its experimental set-up is always investigated:

#### Reactions with steam (Mg - Fe)

| Metal | Observations | Chemical equation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Magnesium | - burn with white light<br>- white powder is formed | $\ce{Mg (s) + H2O (g) -> MgO (s) + H2 (g)}$ |
| Aluminium | - white powder is formed | $\ce{2Al (s) + 3H2O (g) -> Al2O3 (s) + 3H2 (g)}$ |
| Zinc | - a powder is formed, yellow when hot, white when cold | $\ce{Zn (s) + H2O (g) -> ZnO (s) + H2 (g)}$ |
| Iron | - a black powder is formed | $\ce{3Fe (s) + 4H2O (g) -> Fe3O4 (s) + 4H2 (g)}$ |
| Lead, copper, mercury, silver, platinum, gold | - does not react | N/A |

> [!note]
> Wet sand can also be used in place of the damp mineral wool.

#### Reactions with dilute acids (Ca - Pb)
The reaction feasibility and products are based on the dilute acid used.

Overall, the observable changes are:
- **Metal dissolves gradually**
  This is due to the formation of soluble metallic ions.

- **Colourless gas bubbles is given out**

Chemical equation for the reaction (e.g. with zinc):
$\ce{Zn (s) + 2HCl (aq) -> ZnCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)}$
$\ce{Zn (s) + H2SO4 (aq) -> ZnSO4 (aq) + H2 (g)}$

Special cases:
- **Calcium**: $\ce{Ca (s) + H2SO4 (aq) -> CaSO4 (s) + H2 (g)}$
- **Lead**: $\ce{Pb (s) + 2HCl (aq) -> PbCl2 (s) + H2 (g)}$ / $\ce{Pb (s) + H2SO4 (aq) -> PbSO4 (s) + H2 (g)}$
↪️ The reaction stops quickly as insoluble substances form a layer surrounding the metal, which prevents further reaction.

> [!note]
> <u>Very dilute</u> $\ce{HNO3 (aq)}$ can be used to form soluble substances with calcium and lead.
> ↪️ $\ce{Pb (s) + 2HNO3 (aq) -> Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + H2 (g)}$

#### Displacement reaction
**Displacement reaction** can be used to demonstrate the difference in reactivity between two metals.

##### Aqueous displacement reaction
Consider when a copper ribbon is added into an aqueous solution of silver nitrate:
![[aq_displacement_agcu.webp|500]]
- **Chemical equation**: $\ce{Cu (s) + 2AgNO3 (aq) -> Cu(NO3)2 (aq) + 2 Ag (s)}$
- **Ionic equation**: $\ce{Cu (s) + 2Ag+ (aq) -> Cu^2+ (aq) + 2Ag (s)}$
- **Observable changes**:
	- The copper dissolves gradually.
	- The solution turns from colourless to blue.
	- Silvery solid deposits on the copper.
- **Explanation**: As copper is more reactive than silver, copper loses electrons more readily than copper.

> [!note]
> - A less reactive metal cannot displace a more reactive metal from its solution.
> - <u>Sodium and potassium cannot be used to displace a less reactive metal</u> from its aqueous solution. This is because sodium and potassium are very reactive and they will <u>react with water in the aqueous solution preferentially</u>.

##### Solid displacement reaction
<u>On heating</u>, displacement reaction can also take place in solid form.

Consider the reaction between zinc and copper(II) oxide:
- **Chemical equation**: $\ce{Zn (s) + CuO (s) ->[heat] ZnO (s) + Cu (s)}$
- **Observable changes**:
	- Reddish brown solid is formed.
- **Explanation**: As zinc is more reactive than copper, zinc will lose electrons more readily than copper.
