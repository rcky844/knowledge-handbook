Aluminium has a great corrosion resistance due to the formation of the <u>aluminium oxide layer</u> on its surface.
- The thin layer of aluminium oxide <u>sticks to the surface of aluminium very strongly</u> and is <u>impermeable to both oxygen and water</u>, protecting it from further corrosion.
- Aluminium is less dense than iron and has weaker strength compared to iron.

#### Anodization of aluminium objects
![[anodization.webp|420]]

The aluminium undergoes oxidation in order to thicken the oxide layer. <u>It has to be made an anode.</u>

<span style="color: lightgreen">Aluminium object to be anodized is connected to anode, and aluminium sheets rolled into a cylindrical shape is connected to the cathode.</span>

<span style="color: skyblue">Dilute sulphuric acid</span> will be used as the electrolyte. It contains mobile ions to conduct electricity.

**Overall equation**:
$\ce{2Al(s) + 3H2O(ℓ) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)}$

**Advantages**:
- The aluminium object becomes <u>more corrosion resistant</u>.
- The <u>hardness</u> of the aluminium object <u>increases</u>.
- The aluminium object can be <u>dyed to give attractive colours</u>.

> [!warning]
> The strength of the aluminium metal is not increased during anodization.
