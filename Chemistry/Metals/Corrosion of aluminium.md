Aluminium has a great corrosion resistance due to the formation of the <span class="hi-blue">aluminium oxide layer</span> on its surface.
- The thin layer of aluminium oxide <u>sticks to the surface of aluminium very strongly</u> (does not flake off) and is <span class="hi-green">impermeable to both oxygen and water</span>, protecting it from further corrosion.
- Aluminium is less dense than iron and has weaker strength compared to iron.

# Anodization of aluminium objects
![[anodization.webp|420]]

- The aluminium undergoes oxidation in order to thicken the oxide layer.
- <span class="hi-green">Aluminium object to be anodized is connected to anode</span>, and aluminium sheets rolled into a cylindrical shape is connected to the cathode.
- <span class="hi-blue">Dilute sulphuric acid</span> will be used as the electrolyte. It contains mobile ions to conduct electricity.

*Overall equation*:
$\ce{2Al(s) + 3H2O(ℓ) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)}$

*Advantages*:
- The aluminium object becomes <u>more corrosion resistant</u>.
- The <u>hardness</u> of the aluminium object <u>increases</u>.
- The aluminium object can be <u>dyed to give attractive colours</u>.

> [!warning]
> The strength of the aluminium metal is not increased during anodization.
