- The thin layer of aluminium oxide sticks to the surface of aluminium very strongly and is impermeable to both oxygen and water, protecting it from further corrosion.
- Aluminium has a great corrosion resistance due to the formation of the aluminium oxide layer on its surface.
- Aluminium is less dense than iron but weaker strength compared to iron.

#### Anodization of aluminium objects
![[anodization.webp|420]]

The aluminium undergoes oxidation in order to thicken the oxide layer. It has to be made an anode.

Aluminium object to be anodized is connected to anode, and aluminium sheets rolled into a cylindrical shape is connected to the cathode.

Dilute sulphuric acid will be used as the electrolyte. It contains mobile ions to conduct electricity.

**Overall equation**:
$\ce{2Al(s) + 3H2O(ℓ) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)}$

**Advantages**:
- The aluminium object becomes more corrosion resistant.
- The hardness of the aluminium object increases.
- The aluminium object can be dyed to give attractive colours.

> **Note**:
> The strength of the aluminium metal is not increased.
