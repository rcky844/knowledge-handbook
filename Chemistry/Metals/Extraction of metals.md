#### Reason for extraction
Metals have <span style="color: lightgreen">some physical properties</span> that their compounds do not have:
- Shiny appearance
- Good conductors of electricity and heat
- High melting points and boiling points
- Ductility
- Melleability

However, metals tend to form compounds with non-metal as ores.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">The more reactive is the metal, the more stable is the metal compound in the ores.</span>
- The more stable is the metal compound in the ores, the more complicated the method is required to be invented.
- The more reactive the metals, the later they can be extracted in history due to time needed for technological development.

**Example**: HKDSE 2019 Paper 1B Q3(a)
Suggest why iron was used earlier than aluminium in history.
↪️ Iron is less reactive than aluminium.

#### Metal reactivity series
*Pre-context: [[Metallic bonds#Reactivity of metals]]*
In order of decreasing reactivity:
Potassium > Sodium > Calcium > Magnesium > Aluminium > Zinc > Iron > Lead > Copper > Mercury > Silver > Platinum > Gold

↪️ See also: [[Reactivity of metals]] / [[Electrochemical series]]

#### Extraction methods
##### Physical methods
These are suitable for extracting very unreactive metals (e.g. gold and platinum) as they exist as free elements in Earth’s crust.

**Methods**:
- Mechanical separation
- Panning

##### Chemical methods
> [!note]
> Although the methods for dealing with more reactive metals can be used to extract less reactive metals from their ores, this will not be done due to cost concerns.

###### Heating the metal ore alone in air
This method is suitable for extracting silver and mercury.
- When their oxides are heated, they undergo thermal decomposition to give metals.

↪️ Heating mercury(II) oxide: $\ce{2HgO (s) ->[heat] 2Hg (ℓ) + O2 (g)}$

###### Heating the metal ore with reducing agent
This method is suitable for extracting copper, lead, iron and zinc.

These metals require heating with reducing agents like carbon or graphite to extract.

↪️ Heating lead(II) oxide with carbon: $\ce{2PbO (s) + C (s) ->[heat] 2Pb (s) + CO2 (g)}$

Besides carbon, other reducing agents such as carbon monoxide gas, hydrogen gas or town gas (contain both carbon monoxide gas and hydrogen gas) can also be used.
![[metal_reduction_town_gas.webp|500]]

↪️ Heating zinc(II) oxide with hydrogen: $\ce{ZnO (s) + H2 (g) ->[heat] Zn (s) + H2O (ℓ)}$
↪️ Heating zinc(II) oxide with carbon monoxide: $\ce{CuO (s) + CO (g) ->[heat] Cu (s) + CO2 (g)}$

> [!note]
> - An opening is made to prevent the excess build up of gas, which may cause the boiling tube to crack.
> - The excess hydrogen / carbon monoxide is burned since hydrogen is explosive and flammable.
> - The experiment should be performed in a fume cupboard.

###### Electrolysis of molten metal ore
*See also: [[Electrolysis]]*
This method is suitable for extracting <u>aluminium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium</u>.

![[electrolysis_molten_metal.webp|600]]
- The metal ore must be heated to <span style="color: aqua">molten (liquid) state</span>.
  ↪️ $\ce{Al2O3 (s) ->[heat] Al^3+ (ℓ) + O^2- (ℓ)}$

- The positive $\ce{Al^3+ (ℓ)}$ ions are attracted towards the negative electrode (cathode), and is <span style="color: lightgreen">reduced to aluminium metal</span>:
  ↪️ $\ce{Al^3+ (ℓ) + 3e- -> Al(ℓ)}$

- The negative $\ce{O^2- (ℓ)}$ ions are attracted towards the positive electrode (anode), and is <span style="color: lightgreen">oxidized to oxygen</span>:
  ↪️ $\ce{2O^2- (ℓ) -> O2 (g) + 4e-}$

- *Overall chemical equation*: $\ce{2Al2O3 (ℓ) -> 4Al (ℓ) + 3O2 (g)}$

> [!note]
> - The <span style="color: lightgreen">graphite electrodes have to be replaced constantly</span> as the <span style="color: aqua">oxygen formed will react with carbon</span>.
> - The electrolyte used cannot be aqueous solutions containing aluminium ions as $\ce{H+(aq)}$ ions are always preferentially discharged in aqueous solution.

#### Recycling of metals
##### Reasons
- Metals have certain properties that its ore / compounds do not have (e.g. high electrical conductivity, shiny appearance).
- Metal resource is limited.

##### Importance
1. Recycling saves metal resources.
2. Recycling saves energy and other resources (e.g. electricity, water and fuels) for extracting new metals.
3. Recycling metals can reduce metal waste and land use for waste disposal.
4. Recycling helps to reduce pollution.
5. Recycling activities promote public awareness of conserving metals.

##### Problems
1. It is difficult and time consuming to sort out the metal waste from the rubbish dumped which consists of different materials.
2. The cost of collecting, sorting and transporting the metal waste is high in Hong Kong.
3. The cost of melting and purifying the metals is high in Hong Kong.
4. People need to change their habits from simply throwing away used metal objects to putting them into proper recycling bins.
