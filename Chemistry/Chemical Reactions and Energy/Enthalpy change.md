**Enthalpy change of reaction** ($\Delta H$) is the <span class="hi-green">heat change of a reaction</span> measured <span class="hi-blue">at constant pressure</span>.

*Definition for enthalpy*:
- Enthalpy is the <span class="hi-orange">heat content</span> of a substance, which is the sum of thermal energy and bond energy which the substances carry <span class="hi-blue">at that temperature</span>.
- The enthalpy of substances <span class="hi-green">increases with temperature</span> as their <span class="hi-green">thermal energy increases</span>.
- Enthalpy of a substance cannot be measured, so the difference in enthalpy of reactants and products is measured ($\Delta H = H \text{ (products)} - H \text{ (reactants)}$).

*Enthalpy change*:
- Energy change occurs in a reaction, which usually results in <span class="hi-green">energy transfer between the system and its surroundings</span>.

> [!note]
> - Heat change at constant volume = Change in internal energy
> - Heat change at constant pressure = Change in internal energy + Work done (on the surroundings)
> 
> = Enthalpy change of reaction ($\Delta H$)

# Thermal chemical equation
The **thermal chemical equation** shows the enthalpy change along with the <span class="hi-blue">mole ratios</span> of reactants. 
- <span class="hi-green"><u>Physical states of the reacting species must be stated</u></span> because <span class="hi-orange">standard enthalpy change of substances in different physical states is different</span>.

*Example*:
$\ce{CH3CH2OH(ℓ) + 3O2(g) -> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(ℓ)} \qquad \Delta H = \pu{-1371 kJ mol-1}$

# Standard enthalpy change
*Standard conditions*:
- $\pu{25\degree C/298K}$ at $\pu{1atm}$
- $\pu{1 mol dm-3}$ (for solutions)
- Matters in their <span class="hi-blue">standard state</span> (most stable form)

## Standard enthalpy change of combustion ($\Delta H^⊖_c$)
*Definition*:
The enthalpy change when <span class="hi-green">1 mole of the substance (/ compound) is <u>burnt completely</u> in $\ce{O2}$</span> under standard conditions.
- The enthalpy change with <span class="hi-orange">incomplete combustion is not the same as with complete combustion</span>.

*Examples*:
- $\ce{H2(g) + {1\over2}O2(g) -> H2O(ℓ)} \qquad \Delta H = \pu{-285.8 kJ mol-1}$
- $\ce{C6H12O6(s) + 6O2(g) -> 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(ℓ)} \qquad \Delta H = \pu{-2840 kJ mol-1}$

## Standard enthalpy change of neutralization ($\Delta H^⊖_n$)
*Definition*:
The enthalpy change when <span class="hi-blue"><u>an acid</u></span> solution and <span class="hi-blue"><u>a base / an alkali</u></span> solution react together under standard conditions to <span class="hi-green">produce 1 mole of water</span>.

*$\Delta H^⊖_n$ of different acids and alkalis*:

| Acid | Alkali | $\pu{\Delta H^⊖_n / KJ mol-1}$ | Acid | Alkali | $\pu{\Delta H^⊖_n / KJ mol-1}$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $\ce{HNO3}$ | $\ce{KOH}$ | <span class="hi-green">-57.3</span> | $\ce{HCl}$ | $\ce{NH3}$ | -52.2 |
| $\ce{HNO3}$ | $\ce{NaOH}$ | <span class="hi-green">-57.3</span> | $\ce{CH3COOH}$ | $\ce{NH3}$ | -51.5 |
| $\ce{HCl}$ | $\ce{NaOH}$ | <span class="hi-green">-57.3</span> | $\ce{H2S}$ | $\ce{NaOH}$ | -16.0 |
| $\ce{H2SO4}$ | $\ce{NaOH}$ | <span class="hi-green">-57.3</span> | $\ce{HCN}$ | $\ce{NaOH}$ | -12.0 |
| $\ce{CH3COOH}$ | $\ce{NaOH}$ | -55.2 |

> [!note]
> - <span class="hi-green">All strong acid + strong alkali reactions release the same amount of heat</span> ($\Delta H^⊖_n = \pu{‐57.3 kJ mol-1}$), because all neutralization reactions are the result of the reaction: <span class="hi-orange">$\ce{H+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H2O(ℓ)}$</span>.
> - <span class="hi-green">Weaker acids and alkali have less exothermic reactions as their ionization is endothermic</span>, some of the heat released is lost to this ionization.

*Examples*:
- $\ce{HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) -> NaCl(aq) + H2O(ℓ)} \qquad \Delta H = \pu{-57.3 kJ mol-1}$

## Standard enthalpy change of formation ($\Delta H^⊖_f$)
*Definition*:
The enthalpy change when <span class="hi-green">1 mole of a substance is formed from its elements</span> under standard conditions.

*Examples*:
- $\ce{H2(g) + O2(g) -> H2O(ℓ) \qquad \Delta H^⊖_f = \pu{-285.8 kJ mol-1}}$
- $\ce{{1\over2}H2(g) + {1\over2}Cl2(g) -> HCl(aq) \qquad \Delta H^⊖_f = \pu{-92.3 kJ mol-1}}$

> [!note] $\Delta H^⊖_f$ for elements
> It is equal to zero for all elements, with exceptions:
> - $\Delta H^⊖_f\,[\ce{C\,(diamond)}] = \pu{+1.9 kJ mol-1}$
> - $\Delta H^⊖_f\,[\ce{O2(g)}] = \pu{+143.0 kJ mol-1}$
> 
> ↪ They are not equal to zero because they are <span class="hi-orange">not at their most stable form under standard conditions</span>.

> [!warning] Difficulty in determining $\Delta H^⊖_f$ for some compounds
> - Some reactions <span class="hi-orange">proceed too slowly</span> under standard conditions.
> - Some reactions are <span class="hi-orange">highly exothermic</span> and so the <span class="hi-orange">experiments cannot be carried out safely</span>.
> - The constituent elements do not react to give the desired compound only.
> 
> ↪ They have to be determined indirectly by [[Hess’s Law]].
> 
> *Example*:
> $\ce{2C\,(graphite) + 2H2(g) -> C2H4(g) \qquad \Delta H^⊖_f = \pu{+52.3 kJ mol-1}}$
