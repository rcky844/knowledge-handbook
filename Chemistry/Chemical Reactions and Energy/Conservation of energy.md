# Concept of enthalpy change of a reaction
**Enthalpy change of reaction** ($\Delta H$) is the <span class="hi-green">heat change of a reaction</span> measured <span class="hi-blue">at constant pressure</span>.

*Definition for enthalpy*:
- Enthalpy is the <span class="hi-orange">heat content</span> of a substance, which is the sum of thermal energy and bond energy which the substances carry <span class="hi-blue">at that temperature</span>.
- The enthalpy of substances <span class="hi-green">increases with temperature</span> as their <span class="hi-green">thermal energy increases</span>.
- Enthalpy of a substance cannot be measured, so the difference in enthalpy of reactants and products is measured ($\Delta H = H \text{ (products)} - H \text{ (reactants)}$).

*Enthalpy change*:
- Energy change occurs in a reaction, which usually results in <span class="hi-green">energy transfer between the system and its surroundings</span>.

> [!note]
> - Heat change at constant volume = Change in internal energy
> - Heat change at constant pressure = Change in internal energy + Work done (on the surroundings)
