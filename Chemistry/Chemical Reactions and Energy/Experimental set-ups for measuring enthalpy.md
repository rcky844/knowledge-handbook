**Calorimetry** is the <span class="hi-green">experimental method of measuring enthalpy changes</span> of <span class="hi-orange">chemical reactions or physical processes</span>.
- A <span class="hi-blue">calorimeter</span> is the device used for measuring the heat change (e.g. <u>thermoflask, polystyrene cup</u>).

# Heat change calculation
$$
\text{\textcolor{#FEC900}{heat changed} \textcolor{#007BFF}{(absorbed / released)}} = mc\Delta T
$$

*Mass of the solution ($m$)*:
- If only the volume of the solution is given, mass can be calculated by: $\text{volume of solution}\times\text{density} = \text{mass}$.
- For dilute solutions, it is usually assumed to be equal to that of water (i.e. $\pu{1.0 g cm-3}$).

*Specific heat capacity of solution ($c$)*:
- <span class="hi-green">Amount of energy required to heat up $\pu{1g}$ of solution in $\pu{1K}$ or $\pu{1\degree C}$</span>.
- For dilute solutions, it is usually equal to that of water (i.e. $\pu{4.2 / 4.18 J g-1 K-1}$).

*Temperature change ($\Delta T$)*:
- The rise in $\pu{1\degree C}$ is the same as $\pu{1K}$, there is no need to convert the unit in finding temperature change.

# Set-up designs for simple calorimetry

*Reasoning behind placement of apparatus*:
- **Metal can**: <span class="hi-green">Minimize the amount of heat absorbed by the container</span>
- **Polystyrene board / screen**: <span class="hi-green">Reduce heat loss to the surroundings</span>
- **Lid**: <span class="hi-green">Covers the can / breaker to minimize heat loss to the surroundings</span>

> [!note] Assumption
> All of the heat released is used to heat the water, there is no heat loss to the surroundings.

*Reasoning behind placement of apparatus*:
- **Stirrer**: <span class="hi-green">To ensure even distribution of heat throughout the system / solution</span>
- **Thermometer**: <span class="hi-green">Suspended in the solution above the bottom of the cup to prevent errors</span>
- **Polystyrene cup / cotton wool**: <span class="hi-green">To prevent heat loss to the surroundings</span>

## Sources of error
Despite various measures to improve accuracy of data, there can still be <span class="hi-green">differences from theoretical data</span>.
- There was <span class="hi-orange">heat loss to the surroundings</span>.
- The <span class="hi-orange">heat capacity of the calorimeter</span> (<u>container, stirrer & thermometer</u>) was <span class="hi-orange">not taken into account</span>.
- **For combustion reactions**:
  <span class="hi-orange">Incomplete combustion occurred.</span> Some of the hydrocarbon burnt incompletely to form black soot (carbon) and carbon monoxide.
- **For neutralization reactions**:
  The <span class="hi-orange">density and specific heat capacity of the reaction mixture were different from those of water</span>.
- The experiment was <span class="hi-orange">not carried out under standard conditions</span>.

## Deriving $\Delta H$ from data obtained via calorimetry
1. **Find heat released by $mc\Delta T$**
   $\text{heat change} = \text{mass}\times\text{heat capacity}\times\text{temperature change}$

2. **Find the no. of moles of reacting species**
   â†ª Take into account for any <span class="hi-blue">limiting reagent</span>, especially in <span class="hi-green">neutralization reactions</span>, and select the <u>no. of mole of limiting reagent</u> for use in the next step.

3. **Calculate $\Delta H$**
	- Divide the result of step 1 by that of step 2 to get heat change.
	- For <span class="hi-blue">endothermic reactions</span>, the value should be <span class="hi-green">positive (+)</span> by this step.
	- For <span class="hi-blue">exothermic reactions</span>, the value should be <span class="hi-green">negative (-)</span> by this step.
