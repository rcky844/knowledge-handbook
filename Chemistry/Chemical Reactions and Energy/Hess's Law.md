**Hess's Law** provides an <span class="hi-orange">indirect route</span> to calculate the <span class="hi-green">enthalpy change of the main reaction route</span> which can be difficult to determine directly.

> [!info] Reasons for using Hess's Law
> - The reaction is <span class="hi-green">explosive</span>, it is too <span class="hi-green">dangerous</span> to find it this way.
> - The <span class="hi-green">rate of reaction is too slow</span>.
> - The reaction <span class="hi-green">does not occur under standard conditions</span>.
> - The reaction <span class="hi-green">produces side products</span>. (e.g. reaction of carbon and oxygen can produce $\ce{CO}$ and $\ce{CO2}$)

> [!tip] Concept of Hess's Law
> The <span class="hi-orange">total</span> enthalpy change of a chemical reaction is <span class="hi-green">independent</span> of the pathway / route taken between initial and final states.
