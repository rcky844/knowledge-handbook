#### Unique nature of carbon
1. Carbon can <u>form strong covalent bonds with itself</u> to give chains and rings of carbon atoms.
2. Each carbon atom can <u>form four covalent bonds</u>. The four covalent bonds of a carbon atom are arranged in a tetrahedral shape.
3. Carbon can <u>form multiple bonds</u> (e.g. double / triple bonds).

> [!note]
> - Carbon compounds with double or triple bonds are <span style="color: skyblue">unsaturated compounds</span>.
> - Carbon compounds with only carbon single bonds are <span style="color: skyblue">saturated compounds</span>.
