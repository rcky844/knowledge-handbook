**Alkanes** are saturated hydrocarbons (contains only carbon-carbon single bonds).

# Physical properties
*Increasing carbon atoms*:
- Boiling point, melting point, density, viscosity increases.
- Solubility in $\ce{H2O}$ decreases.

*Boiling point*: Lowest
- Molecules are only held together by weak [[van der Waals' forces]].
- Does not form hydrogen bonds with itself or water molecules.

# Chemical properties
- No reactions with acids, alkalis and metals, as they do not have a functional group, and are non-polar molecules.
- A higher number of carbon atoms would result in a lower rate of reaction.
- **Reactions**: [[Combustion]], [[Substitution reaction#Reaction with halogens|Substitution reaction]], [[Cracking]]
