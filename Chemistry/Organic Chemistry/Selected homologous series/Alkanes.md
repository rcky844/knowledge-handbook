**Alkanes** are saturated hydrocarbons (contains only carbon-carbon single bonds).

**Physical properties**:
With more carbon atoms, the following is changed:
- Boiling point, melting point, density, viscosity increases.
- Solubility in $\ce{H2O}$ decreases.

**Chemical properties**:
Alkanes are chemically unreative / inert, and has reactions with acids, alkalis and metals.
- This is because they do not have a functional group, and are non-polar molecules.
- A higher number of carbon atoms would result in a lower rate of reaction.
