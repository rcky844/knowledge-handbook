Carboxyl group

> **Alkanoic acid**
> ━━━━━━━━━━
> **Suffix**: -oic acid
> **General formula**: $\ce{C_n H_{2n+1} COOH}$
> **Characteristics**: Pungent smell, sour taste
> **Melting point & boiling point**: Higher than alcohols
> **Density**: Less dense than water (except for $\ce{CHOOH}$ and $\ce{CH3COOH}$)
> **Solubility**: Soluble in water (for no. of $\ce{C}$ < 4)

*Explanation for melting points and boiling points*:
Pure carboxylic acid exists as a <span class="hi-blue">dimer</span>. They have more extensive intermolecular [[hydrogen bonds]] than alcohols.

↪️ The relative molecular mass of alkanoic acid is multiplied by 2.
e.g. $\ce{CH3COOH}$
$12\times2 + 16\times2 + 1\times4 = 60$
(=> 120)
