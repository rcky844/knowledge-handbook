**Alkenes** are unsaturated hydrocarbons mainly produced by [[cracking|cracking of petroleum]]. They have similar physical properties to alkanes.

# Physical properties
*See also: [[Alkanes#Physical properties]]*

*Boiling points*: Slightly lower than alkanes
- Molecules are only held together by weak [[van der Waals' forces]].
  The intermolecular forces of alkenes are weaker than that in alkanes.
- Does not form hydrogen bonds with itself or water molecules.

# Chemical properties
*See also: [[Alkanes#Chemical properties]]*

Due to the presence of $\ce{C-C}$ double bonds (functional group), alkenes are more reactive than alkanes.

**Reactions**: [[Combustion]], [[Addition reaction]], [[Addition polymerization]]
