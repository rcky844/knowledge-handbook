**Alkanes** are unsaturated hydrocarbons, they have similar physical properties to alkanes.

**Chemical properties**:
Due to the presence of $\ce{C-C}$ double bonds (functional group), alkenes are more reactive than [[alkanes]].

**Reactions**: [[Combustion]], [[Addition reaction]], [[Addition polymerization]]
