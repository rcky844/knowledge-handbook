**Haloalkanes** are alkanes with one or more hydrogen atom substituted with a halogen atom. They are generally used as organic solvents (e.g. $\ce{CCl4}$, $\ce{CHCl3}$).

# Physical properties

*Boiling points*: Slghtly higher than alkanes
- Molecules are predominantly held together by weak [[van der Waals' forces]].
- Many are polar molecules, they can form dipole-dipole attractions.
- Does not form hydrogen bonds with itself or water molecules.
