$\ce{- X}$
Halo group

> **Haloalkanes**
> ━━━━━━━━━━
> **Suffix**: -an(e)
> **General formula**: $\ce{C_n H_{2n+1} X}$ / $\ce{R-X}$
> **Melting point & boiling point**: Higher than alkanes
> **Density**: Less dense than water, but higher than alkanes
> **Solubility**: Not soluble in water, soluble in organic solvents
> **Usage**: As organic solvents (e.g. $\ce{CCl4}$, $\ce{CHCl3}$)

*Explanation for melting points and boiling points*:
Haloalkanes have polar bonds, there are stronger dipole-dipole attractions.

*Reactions*: [[Substitution reaction#Alkanes|Substitution reaction]]
