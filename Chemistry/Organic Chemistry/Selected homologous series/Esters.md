# Physical properties
*See also: [[Alkanes#Physical properties]]*

*Boiling points*: Higher than alkanes, lower than amines
- Molecules are only held together by weak [[van der Waals' forces]].
  Many are polar molecules, they can form dipole-dipole attractions.
- Does not form hydrogen bonds with itself.

*Density*: Less dense than water

*Solubility in water*:
- Molecules can form one [[hydrogen bonds]] on average with water molecules, as they have an oxygen atom with total of four lone pair electrons.
