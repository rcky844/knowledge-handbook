**Fractional distillation of petroleum** separates the petroleum into fractions by physical method. It makes use of the <u>different molecular sizes and boiling points</u> of hydrocarbon fractions.

#### Laboratory set-up
![[petroleum_distillation_lab.webp|350]]
The mineral wool soaked with petroleum is heated very gently. Fraction with the lowest boiling point range distils off first.

Then. heat the mineral wool more strongly, fractions with higher boiling point ranges distill off one after the other.

Collect various fractions in turn in separate test tubes.

#### Oil refinery set-up
![[petroleum_distillation_refinery.webp|500]]
The petroleum is heated to ~400Â°C in a furnace. The hot liquid and partly vapour oil is then pumped into the bottom of a fractionating tower.

The liquid part (with the highest boiling point) sinks to the bottom of the tower. Other fractions rises up the tower.

The temperature decreases up the tower. At the appropriate temperature, the fraction cools and condenses to liquid. Condensed hydrocarbons flows out and is collected.
