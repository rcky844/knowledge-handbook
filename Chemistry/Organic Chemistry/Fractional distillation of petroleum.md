**Fractional distillation of petroleum** separates the petroleum into fractions by physical method. It makes use of the <span class="hi-green">different molecular sizes and boiling points</span> of hydrocarbon fractions.

# Set-ups
## In laboratory
![[petroleum_distillation_lab.webp|350]]
- Heat the mineral wool soaked with petroleum <span class="hi-green">very gently</span>. Fraction with the <u>lowest</u> boiling point range distils off first.
- Then, heat the mineral wool <span class="hi-green">more strongly</span>, fractions with <u>higher</u> boiling point ranges distill off <u>one after the other</u>.
- Collect various fractions in turn in <span class="hi-blue">separate test tubes</span>.

## In oil refinery

- The petroleum is heated to ~400Â°C in a furnace. The hot liquid and partly vapour oil is then pumped into the bottom of a fractionating tower.
- The <span class="hi-blue">liquid part</span> (with the highest boiling point) <span class="hi-green">sinks to bottom</span> of the tower. Other fractions rises up the tower.
- <span class="hi-green">The temperature <u>decrease</u> up the tower.</span> At the appropriate temperature, the fraction cools and condenses to liquid. Condensed hydrocarbons flows out and is collected.
