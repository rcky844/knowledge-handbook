**Combustion** is an <u>exothermic reaction</u>. It can be used to drive machines.

**General equation** (for <u>complete combustion</u>):
$\ce{C_x H_y + (x+{y\over4})O2 -> xCO_2 + {y\over2}H2O}$

**Incomplete combustion** occurs when the supply for oxygen is limited. The fuel burns to form $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{CO}$, $\ce{C}$ and $\ce{H2O}$. Carbon produced will be released as <span style="color: skyblue">soot</span>, a black smoke can be seen.

#### Consequences of combustion
| Pollutants | Effect | Remedies |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| $\ce{CO}$  | - Binds to haemoglobin and reduces oxygen-carrying capacity. | - Install catalytic converters in motor vehicles<br>- Supply sufficient $\ce{O2}$ during combustion |
| $\ce{SO2}$ | - Causes acid rain<br>- Irritant to the respiratory system | - Replacing diesel oil with LPG for motor vehicles<br>- Use fuels of low S content<br>- Installing scrubbers at power plants |
| $\ce{NO_x}$<br>($\ce{NO}$, $\ce{NO2}$) | - Causes acid rain and photochemical smog<br>- Irritant to the respiratory system | - Install catalytic converters in motor vehicles |
| Unburnt hydrocarbons | - Carcinogenic<br>- Causes photochemical smog | - Install catalytic converters in motor vehicles |
| Suspended particles | - Carcinogenic<br>- Irritant to the respiratory system | - Use electronic precipitators in power plants<br>- Remove dust by mechanical filtering of water gas |
| Lead compounds | - Poisonous<br>- Causes anaemia<br>- Causes neurological issues | Use unlead fuels |

> **Note**:
> - These air pollutants are all formed from the combustion of substances.
> - The pollutants $\ce{CO}$, unburnt hydrocarbons and suspended particles are formed from incomplete combustion.
> - The pollutants $\ce{SO2}$ and $\ce{NO_x}$ are formed from combustion of $\ce{S}$ and $\ce{N2}$ respectively.
> - Lead compounds were added to fuels for cars in the past, and were removed due to its effects on humans.

##### Household hazards
- **Carbon monoxide poisoning**
  Town gas is mixed with $\ce{CO}$, which is poisonous. Leakage of town gas may cause carbon monoxide poisoning.

- **Fire and explosions**
  Town gas contains flammable (hydrocarbons) and explosive substances ($\ce{H2}$).

#### Solutions for pollution
##### Catalytic converters
**Catalytic converters** are installed to vehicles to reduce the amount of pollutants ($\ce{NO_x}$, $\ce{CO}$, unburnt hydrocarbons and soot / suspended particulates) in the exhaust.

They contain <u>catalysts (Pt / Pd)</u> to speed up the rate of reaction.
- Leaded fuels should not be used with catalytic converters, as it would <u>'poison' the catalyst</u>.
- Catalytic converters are shaped like a <span style="color: lightgreen">honeycomb / beehive</span>, this is to <u>increase the surface area for reaction</u>.

**Reactions**:
- Combination of $\ce{CO}$ and $\ce{NO_x}$
  $\ce{2CO(g) + 2NO(g) ->[Pt] 2CO2(g) + N2(g)}$
  $\ce{4CO(g) + 2NO2(g) ->[Pt] 4CO2(g) + N2(g)}$

- Direct removal of $\ce{CO}$
  $\ce{2CO(g) + O2(g) ->[Pt] 2CO2(g)}$

- Combustion of unburnt hydrocarbons
  $\ce{C_x H_y + (x+{y\over4})O2 ->[Pt] xCO_2 + {y\over2}H2O}$

**Harmless products produced**: $\ce{N2}$, $\ce{H2O}$, $\ce{CO2}$

##### Scrubbers
**Scrubbers** involve the use of $\ce{CaO}$ or $\ce{CaCl2}$ to remove $\ce{SO2(g)}$.
