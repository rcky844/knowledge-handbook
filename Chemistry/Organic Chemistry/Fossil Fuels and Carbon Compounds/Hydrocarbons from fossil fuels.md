#### Coal
**Coal** contains over 50% carbon by mass, with <u>hydrocarbons, sulphur compounds, nitrogen compounds, etc.</u>

**Coal** can be used for generating electricity. However, combustion of coal also creates environmental problems as it contains impurities.

##### Formation
- Remains of ancient plants were <u>deeply buried under layers of sand and mud</u>.
- <u>High temperature, pressure and the action of bacteria</u> slowly convert the plant remains into coal.

#### Petroleum and natural gas
**Petroleum**, also **crude oil**, is a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons. **Natural gas** is a gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons, with the main component being <span style="color: skyblue">methane</span> ($\ce{CH4}$).

**Petroleum** consist of mainly:
- **Aliphatic hydrocarbons**
  Carbon atoms joined together in <u>straight chains, branched chains or non-aromatic rings</u>.

- **Aromatic hydrocarbons**
  Carbon compounds with <u>one or more benzene rings</u> (e.g. benzene, toluene (methylbenzene), naphthalene).

##### Formation
Formed when large quantities of dead <u>marine organisms</u> (, such as planktons and algaes), that are buried underneath sedimentary rock are subjected to <u>intense heat</u> and <u>pressure</u> for a long time.

##### Refining process
Direct [[Combustion|combustion]] of petroleum is wasteful as it also contains many <u>fractions</u> useful for purposes other than combustion.

**Fractional distillation of petroleum** separates the petroleum into fractions by physical method. It makes use of the <u>different molecular sizes and boiling points</u> of hydrocarbon fractions.

##### Demand of petroleum fractions
- **Smaller molecule hydrocarbons** make better fuels as they are more volatile, more flammable and burn with a less sooty flame.

##### Uses of petroleum fractions
Generally, petroleum is used as <u>fuels</u> for [[Combustion|combustion]] or a <u>source of hydrocarbons</u> for the production of useful chemicals.
