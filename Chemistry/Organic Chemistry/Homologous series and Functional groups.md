# Functional group
A **functional group** is an atom, or a group of atoms, which determines most of the properties of a compound.

Refer to "[[Selected homologous series]]" for a full list of homologous series.

# Homologous series
**Homologous series** refer to a family of compounds having the same general formula and functional group with adjacent members differing by a $\ce{-CH2-}$ unit.

Compounds of the same homologous series have <u>similar chemical properties</u> because they have the same functional group. However, they have <u>different physical properties</u> (mass, boiling points, melting points, density and viscosity, soluble in $\ce{H2O}$).
