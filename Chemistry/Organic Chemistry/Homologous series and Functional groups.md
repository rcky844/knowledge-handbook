# Functional group
A **functional group** is <u>an atom or a group of atoms</u> which <span class="hi-green">determines most of the properties of a compound</span>.

Refer to "[[Selected homologous series]]" for a full list of homologous series.

# Homologous series
**Homologous series** is a family of compounds having the same <span class="hi-blue">general formula and functional group</span> with adjacent members differing by a $\ce{-CH2-}$ unit.

Compounds of the same homologous series have <u>similar chemical properties</u> because they have the same functional group. However, they have <u>different physical properties</u> (mass, boiling points, melting points, density and viscosity, soluble in $\ce{H2O}$).
