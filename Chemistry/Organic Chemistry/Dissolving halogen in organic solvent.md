Halogen molecules are [[Polarity of bonds and molecules|non-polar]] in nature. By the like-dissolve-like principle, they tend to be more soluble in non-polar organic solvents than in water.

**Examples of non-polar organic solvents**:
- Tetrachloromethane ($\ce{CCl4}$)
- Hexane ($\ce{C6H6}$)
- Chloroform ($\ce{CH3Cl}$)
- Diethyl ether ($\ce{(CH3CH2)2O}$)

When both water and non-polar organic solvent are present within a mixture, two distinct layers will be formed.

**Upper layer** — *Non-polar / hydrocarbon solvent*:
- **Higher in position because of lower density than water.**
  Water molecules can form extensive hydrogen bonds, while van der Waals' forces exist between non-polar molecules.

- **Darker in colour.**
  It contains dissolved halogen.

**Lower layer** — *Polar / aqueous solvent*:
- Colour of dissolved halogen ions is lighter.
