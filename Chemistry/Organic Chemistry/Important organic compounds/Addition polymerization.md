*Pre-context: [[Polymerization]]*

**Addition polymerization** is a reaction in which <span class="hi-blue">monomer molecules</span> join together repeatedly to form polymer molecules, <span class="hi-green">without the elimination of small molecules</span>.

# Representations of addition polymers

# Reaction
![[addition_polymers_reaction.webp|400]]

*Conditions*:
- High temperature
- High pressure
- In the presence of a catalyst

# Examples of addition polymers

## Polyethene (PE)
![[polyethene.webp|240]]
### Low-density polyethene (LDPE)
*Properties*:
- Lightweight
- Flexible
- Cheap
- Resistant to many chemicals
- Low boiling point and softens in boiling water
- Non-poisonous

*Uses*:
- Plastic bags
- Wrapping film for food
- Flexible cold water pipes

### High-density polyethene (HDPE)
*Properties*:
- Rigid
- Cheap
- Resistant to many chemicals
- Higher boiling point than LDPE

*Uses*:
- Bottles for certain chemicals
- Buckets & boxes

## Polypropene (PP)
![[polypropene.webp|240]]

*Properties*:
- Higher melting point and more rigid than PE
- Lightweight
- Resistant to many chemicals

*Uses*:
- Ropes, fibres
- Food containers
- Packaging film

## Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
![[pvc.webp|240]]
*Properties*:
- Rigid, but becomes soft and flexible when mixed with a plasticizer
- Water-resistant
- Good electrical conductor
- Poisonous (due to presence of $\ce{Cl}$)

*Uses*:
<u>Without plasticizer</u>
- Floor tiles
- Drainage pipes

<u>With plasticizer</u>
- Shower curtains
- Insulating covering for electrical wires

## Polystyrene (PS)
![[polystyrene.webp|240]]

*Properties*:
<u>Normal polystyrene</u>
- Transparent
- Hard but brittle

<u>Expanded polystyrene</u>
- White solid foam
- Lightweight
- Quite rigid
- Excellent heat insulator
- Good shock-absorbent

*Uses*:
<u>Normal polystyrene</u>
- See-through containers
  (e.g. sample bottles, measuring cups, CD cases)

<u>Expanded polystyrene</u>
- Packaging material
- Lightweight ceiling tiles
- Disposable food cups and boxes

## Perspex
![[perspex.webp|300]]
*Monomer*: 2-methylpropenoate

*Properties:*
- Highly transparent
- Tough; hard and rigid
- Easily stretched

*Uses*:
- Aircraft windows
- Optical lens
- Illuminated signs
- Plastic optical fibres

# Environmental issues
> [!info] Biodegradable plastics
> Most plastics are <span class="hi-green">non-biodegradable</span>, which will <u>accumulate</u> in the environment and pollute soil and water.
> 
> One of the solution to solve environmental problems is making <span class="hi-blue">biodegradable plastics</span>. Examples include PLAs, starch blends or cellulose-based plastics.

## Disposal methods
### Incineration
*Advantages*:
- Can reduce the volume of solid waste
- Converts plastic wastes into energy ([[combustion]])

*Disadvantages*:
- Releases toxic gases ($\ce{CO}$ / dioxin)
- Releases greenhouse gas $\ce{CO2}$
- Releases particulates which cause respiratory diseases (/ darkening of buildings)
- Cost to remove air pollutants from flue gas is high

### Landfilling
*Advantages*:
- Does not cause much air pollution
- Produces methane which can be collected as fuel

*Disadvantages*:
- A lot of landfill sites are required
- Causes underground water pollution

### Recycling
*Advantages*:
- Saves petroleum, which is a non-renewable energy source
- Reduces the volume of solid waste
- Can help to conserve plastic materials
- Does not cause much air pollution

*Disadvantages*:
- Difficult to separate specific materials from other wastes
- Recycling is energy consuming and not cost effective
