# Structure
![[detergent.webp|400]]
A detergent has an <span class="hi-blue">ionic head</span> which is <span class="hi-green">hydrophilic</span> and a <span class="hi-blue">hydrocarbon tail</span> which is <span class="hi-green">hydrophobic</span>.

# Cleansing action
## Problems with water as cleansing medium
Water is used to clean substances to wash away dirt on clothes or other surfaces, but it is an ineffective cleansing medium:
1. **High surface tension** (water only)
   Water has a <span class="hi-green">high surface tension</span> due to its <span class="hi-green">extensive (intermolecular) hydrogen bonds</span>, causing the water molecules to always hold into a drop. This slows the wetting of fabric surfaces and inhibits the cleansing process.

2. **Inability to dissolve and remove grease** (water + oil)
   When grease would bind to dirt particles on a surface, water cannot remove the grease and dirt, as <span class="hi-green">grease is insoluble in water</span>.

To enhance the cleansing ability of water, detergent acts as two agents:
- <span class="hi-blue">Wetting agent</span> (water only)
- <span class="hi-blue">Emulsifying agent</span> (water + oil)

## Wetting property
Detergents are a <span class="hi-blue">wetting agent</span> and <span class="hi-green">reduce the surface tension of water</span>, which <u>spreads the water to wet the surface</u>.

*Detailed explanation*:
- When the detergent is added into water, the hydrophilic head of detergent would dissolve in the water molecule, and the hydrophobic tail would stick out of the water molecule.
- The intervening detergent particles <u>separate water molecules and weaken the hydrogen bonds between water molecules</u>, hence <u>decreasing the surface tension of water</u>.
- The water would wet the surface more thoroughly instead of beading up.

## Emulsifying property
- Detergents contain a <span class="hi-blue">hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail</span> which <span class="hi-green">dissolves in oil</span>;
- While it has a <span class="hi-blue">hydrophilic ionic head</span> which <span class="hi-green">dissolves in water</span>.
- <u>Water molecules attract the hydrophilic ionic head and bring the oil into water.</u>
- <u>Upon shaking, the oil will break into droplets and cannot come together again due to repulsion of negative ionic head of detergent.</u>

# Types and property of detergents
| | Soapy detergents | Soapless detergent |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| **Sources** | From natural fats and oils | From petroleum |
| **Ionic head** | Carboxylate group ($\ce{-COO^-}$) | Sulphonate group ($\ce{-OSO3^-}$) / <br>Sulphate group ($\ce{-SO3^-}$) |
| **Examples** | $\ce{CH3(CH2)6 COO- Na+}$ | $\ce{CH3(CH2)11 - O - SO3- Na+}$<br>$\ce{CH3(CH2)11 SO3- Na+}$ |
*Effectiveness*:
- <span class="hi-green">Soapless detergents work much better than soapy detergent in <u>hard water</u></span> (water containing $\ce{Ca^2+}$ or $\ce{Mg^2+}$), since soapless detergents would not form scum while soapy detergents would with hard water.

*Biodegradability*:
- <span class="hi-green">Determined by its structure</span> (not their source!)
- <span style="color: aqua">A detergent is biodegradable when there is no branched chains in its structure.</span>

# Production of detergents
## Soapy detergents
**Soapy detergents** are made from <u>natural fats and oils</u>. Natural fats and oils are esters which consists of ester groups ($\ce{-COO}$).

*Example*: [[Lipids#Triglycerides]]
![[triglycerides_chem.webp|180]]

By [[Hydrolysis#Alkaline hydrolysis|alkaline hydrolysis]] of triglyceride, an alcohol and carboxylate salt can be obtained.
![[saponification.webp|700]]
â†ª This process is called <span class="hi-blue">saponification</span>.

### Production of soap in laboratory
1. Heat the <u>vegetable oil</u> with *concentrated $\ce{NaOH}$ solution* (which allows saponification).

2. After the reaction, add *concentrated $\ce{NaCl}$ solution* into the reaction mixture to help <u>salting out</u> of the soap.

> [!note]
> - As soapy detergent is a salt with ionic bonds, it would be soluble in water.
> - Addition of concentrated $\ce{NaCl}$ solution decreases the solubility of soap in the reaction mixture to allow extraction of soapy detergent in the form of solid.

3. Filter to obtain the soap. Wash the soap with a little distilled water and allow it to dry.

## Soapless detergents
**Soapless detergents** are made from hydrocarbons obtained from <u>petroleum</u>.

The hydrocarbons are first reacted with very concentrated $\ce{H2SO4}$ and the product is then neutralized with $\ce{NaOH}$.
