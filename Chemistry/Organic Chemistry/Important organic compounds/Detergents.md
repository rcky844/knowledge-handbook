#### Structure
![[detergent.webp|400]]
A detergent has an <span style="color: skyblue">ionic head</span> which is <span style="color: lightgreen">hydrophilic</span> and a <span style="color: skyblue">hydrocarbon tail</span> which is <span style="color: lightgreen">hydrophobic</span>.

> **Note**:

> - The cation is unimportant in the cleansing action of detergents

#### Cleansing action
##### Problems with water as cleansing medium
Water is commonly used to clean substances by washing away dirt on clothes or other surfaces. However, it has several problems that makes it an ineffective cleansing medium:

1. **High surface tension** (water only)
   Water has a high surface tension due to its extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds, causing the water molecules to always hold into a drop. This slows the wetting of fabric surfaces and inhibits the cleansing process.

2. **Inability to dissolve and remove grease** (water + oil)
   When grease would b￼￼Types and formation
ind to dirt particles on a surface, water cannot remove the grease and dirt. This is because grease is insoluble in water.

To enhance the cleansing ability of water, detergent acts as two agents:
- Wetting agent (water only)
- Emulsifying agent (water + oil)

##### Wetting property
Detergents are a <span style="color: skyblue">wetting agent</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">reduce the surface tension of water</span>, which <u>spreads the water to wet the surface</u>.

**Detailed explanation**:
- When the detergent is added into water, the hydrophilic head of detergent would dissolve in the water molecule, and the hydrophobic tail would stick out of the water molecule.
- The intervening detergent particles <u>separate water molecules and weaken the hydrogen bonds between water molecules</u>, hence <u>decreasing the surface tension of water</u>.
- The water would wet the surface more thoroughly instead of beading up.

##### Emulsifying property
- Detergents contain a <span style="color: skyblue">hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail</span> which <span style="color: lightgreen">dissolves in oil</span>;
- While it has a <span style="color: skyblue">hydrophilic ionic head</span> which <span style="color: lightgreen">dissolves in water</span>.
- <u>Water molecules attract the hydrophilic ionic head and bring the oil into water.</u>
- <u>Upon shaking, the oil will break into droplets and cannot come together again due to repulsion of negative ionic head of detergent.</u>

#### Types and property of detergents
##### Soapy detergents
**Soapy detergents** are made from natural fats and oils.
- They mostly have carboxylate group ($\ce{-COO^-}$) as ionic head.
- They have longer hydrocarbon tails than soapless detergents.

**Example**: $\ce{CH3(CH2)6 COO- Na+}$

##### Soapless detergents
**Soapless detergent** are made from chemicals derived from petroleum.
- They can have either sulphonate group ($\ce{-OSO3^-}$) or sulphate group ($\ce{-SO3^-}$) as ionic head.
- They work much better than soapy detergent in hard water (water containing $\ce{Ca^2+}$ or $\ce{Mg^2+}$), since soapless detergents would not form scum while soapy detergents would with hard water.

**Examples**:
$\ce{CH3(CH2)11 - O - SO3- Na+}$
$\ce{CH3(CH2)11 SO3- Na+}$

##### Biodegradability
Whether detergents are biodegradable <u>does not depend on the source of their hydrocarbon</u>, but its structure.
↪️ <u>A detergent is biodegradable when there is no branched chains in its structure.</u>

#### Manufacturing of detergents
##### Soapy detergents
**Soapy detergents** are made from <u>natural fats and oils</u>. Natural fats and oils are esters which consists of ester groups ($\ce{-COO}$).

**Example**: [[Lipids#Triglycerides]]
![[triglycerides_chem.webp|180]]

By [[Hydrolysis#Alkaline hydrolysis|alkaline hydrolysis]] of triglyceride, an alcohol and carboxylate salt can be obtained.
![[saponification.webp|700]]
↪️ This process is called <span style="color: skyblue">saponification</span>.

###### Production of soap in laboratory
1. Heat the <u>vegetable oil</u> with *concentrated $\ce{NaOH}$ solution* (which allows saponification).

2. After the reaction, add *concentrated $\ce{NaCl}$ solution* into the reaction mixture to help <u>salting out</u> of the soap.

> **Note**:
> - As soapy detergent is a salt with ionic bonds, it would be soluble in water.
> - Addition of concentrated $\ce{NaCl}$ solution decreases the solubility of soap in the reaction mixture to allow extraction of soapy detergent in the form of solid.

3. Filter to obtain the soap. Wash the soap with a little distilled water and allow it to dry.

##### Soapless detergents
**Soapless detergents** are made from hydrocarbons obtained from petroleum.

The hydrocarbons are first reacted with very concentrated $\ce{H2SO4}$ and the product is then neutralized with $\ce{NaOH}$.
