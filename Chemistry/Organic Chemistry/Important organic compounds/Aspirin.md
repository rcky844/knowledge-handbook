**Aspirin** (acetylsalicylic acid) is a common active ingredient found in <span style="color: lightgreen">pain killers</span>. It has a <u>carboxyl group</u> ($\ce{-COOH}$) and <u>ester group</u> ($\ce{-OCOCH3}$).

#### Solubility of Aspirin
**Aspirin** is <span style="color: lightgreen">non-polar</span> and only <span style="color: lightgreen">slightly soluble</span> in water.

In order to make it work more quickly, it is reacted with $\ce{NaOH}$ to produce sodium salt of aspirin, which it has a giant ionic structure with ionic bond to dissolve inside stomach acid and get into the bloodstream more rapidly.

> [!note]
> To not lose the chemical function of aspirin, the reaction mixture <u>will not be heated under reflux</u>. This prevents the alkaline hydrolysis of the ester group of aspirin.
