#### Solubility of Aspirin
For aspirin to work, it must dissolve inside the stomach acid before it gets into the bloodstream. However, aspirin is relatively non-polar and only slightly soluble in water.

To make it work more quickly, aspirin can be reacted with $\ce{NaOH}$ to produce sodium salt of aspirin. As it has a giant ionic structure with ionic bond, it is much more soluble in water.

> **Note**:
> To not lose the chemical function of aspirin, the reaction mixture will not be heated under reflux. This prevents the alkaline hydrolysis of the ester group of aspirin.
