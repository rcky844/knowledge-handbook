*Pre-context: [[Polymerization]] / [[Addition polymerization]]*

**Condensation polymerization** is a reaction in which <u>monomer molecules</u> join together repeatedly to form polymer molecules, <u>with the elimination of small molecules</u> (e.g. $\ce{H2O}$, $\ce{HCl}$).

#### Polyester
**Polyester** are polymers with <u>monomer units linked by ester linkage</u> (![[ester_group.webp|60]]).
- Monomers should be dicarboxylic acid ($\ce{-COOH}$) and diol ($\ce{-OH}$) such that repeated condensation reaction could occur between polymers to form a large polyester.
- Monomers should be <u>bifunctional</u>, with the molecules able to react with neighbouring molecules to <u>form a chain</u>.

##### Polyesters from two types of monomers
**Example**:
![[pet.svg|500]]
**PET (Polyethylene terephthalate)** is formed by repeated [[esterification]] between benzene-1,4-dioic acid and ethane-1,2-diol.

> **Note**:
> The stoichiometric ratio of the water produced can also be $2n-1$.

**Intermolecular forces between PET chains**:
![[pet_intermolecular.webp|600]]
There are only <u>van der Waals' forces</u> between PET chains.
- PET has <u>great strength</u> as the $\ce{C=O}$ groups in the <u>polymer chains are polar</u> and there is considerable intermolecular attraction between the polymer chains.

> **Note**:
> Even though the O atoms may have a lone pair of electrons, it is <u>insoluble in water</u> as the <u>polymer chains are too long</u>.

**Properties of polyesters**:
- **They do not have a sharp melting point**
  Each polyester contains a different number of monomers ($n$).

- **Decomposition by acids and alkalis**
  PET undergoes [[hydrolysis]] in the presence of acids or alkalis, it breaks the ester linkages and lead to a formation of a hole on fabridcs made from polyester.
  ↪️ This allows them to be readily degraded in the environment.

- **Miscellaneous**
  Water & chemical resistance
  Tough, Strong, Smooth, Lightweight

**Uses of PET**:
- Synthetic fibres for clothing and bedding
- Bottles of soft drinks
- Lightweight sails

##### Polyesters from one type of monomer
**Example**: polylactide
![[polylactide.webp|500]]
The polyester is made from just one type of monomer containing $\ce{-COOH}$ and $\ce{-OH}$ groups.

#### Polyamide
**Polyamide** are polymers with <u>monomer units linked by amide linkage</u> (![[amide_group.webp|60]]).
<!-- The group might be slightly false, should be without the H -->
- Monomers should be dicarboxylic acid ($\ce{-COOH}$) and diamine ($\ce{-NH2}$) such that repeated condensation reaction could occur between polymers to form a large polyester.
- Monomers should be <u>bifunctional</u>, with the molecules able to react with neighbouring molecules to <u>form a chain</u>.

##### Polyamide from two types of monomers
**Example**:
![[nylon66.svg|500]]
**Nylon-6,6** is formed by repeated condensation reaction between hexane-1,6-diamine and hexanedioic acid.

> **Note**:
> The stoichiometric ratio of the water produced can also be $2n-1$.

**Intermolecular forces between nylon-6,6 chains**:
![[nylon66_hbond.webp|600]]
There are <u>hydrogen bonds</u> between nylon-6,6 chains.


**Properties of polyamide**:
- **They do not have a sharp melting point.**
  Each polyamide contains a different number of monomers ($n$).

- **Decomposition by acids and alkalis**
  Nylon-6,6 undergoes [[hydrolysis]] in the presence of acids or alkalis, it breaks the amide linkages and lead to a formation of a hole on fabridcs made from polyester.
  ↪️ This allows them to be readily degraded in the environment.

- **High tensile strength**
  As there are intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the polyamides (also van der Waals' forces), the strength of nylon-6,6 should be greater than PET if they both have the same number of monomers or polymeric lengths ($n$).

- **Miscellaneous**
  Water-proof
  Smooth surface, “Waxy touch”

**Uses of PET**:
- Fishing ropes
- Fishing lines
- Tennis racket strings
- Stockings
