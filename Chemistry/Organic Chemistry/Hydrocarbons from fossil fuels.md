#### Coal
**Coal** contains over 50% carbon by mass, with <u>hydrocarbons, sulphur compounds, nitrogen compounds, etc.</u>

**Coal** can be used for generating electricity. However, combustion of coal also creates environmental problems as it contains impurities.

##### Formation
- Remains of ancient plants were <u>deeply buried under layers of sand and mud</u>.
- <u>High temperature, pressure and the action of bacteria</u> slowly convert the plant remains into coal.

#### Petroleum and natural gas
**Petroleum**, also **crude oil**, is a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons. **Natural gas** is a gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons, with the main component being <span style="color: skyblue">methane</span> ($\ce{CH4}$).

**Petroleum** consist of mainly:
- **Aliphatic hydrocarbons**
  Carbon atoms joined together in <u>straight chains, branched chains or non-aromatic rings</u>.

- **Aromatic hydrocarbons**
  Carbon compounds with <u>one or more benzene rings</u> (e.g. benzene, toluene (methylbenzene), naphthalene).

##### Formation
Formed when large quantities of dead <u>marine organisms</u> (, such as planktons and algaes), that are buried underneath sedimentary rock are subjected to <u>intense heat</u> and <u>pressure</u> for a long time.

##### Refining process
Direct [[Combustion|combustion]] of petroleum is wasteful as it also contains many <u>fractions</u> useful for purposes other than combustion.

**Fractional distillation of petroleum** separates the petroleum into fractions by physical method. It makes use of the <u>different molecular sizes and boiling points</u> of hydrocarbon fractions.

###### Laboratory set-up
![[petroleum_distillation_lab.webp|350]]
The mineral wool soaked with petroleum is heated very gently. Fraction with the lowest boiling point range distils off first.

Then. heat the mineral wool more strongly, fractions with higher boiling point ranges distill off one after the other.

Collect various fractions in turn in separate test tubes.

###### Oil refinery set-up
![[petroleum_distillation_refinery.webp|500]]
The petroleum is heated to ~400Â°C in a furnace. The hot liquid and partly vapour oil is then pumped into the bottom of a fractionating tower.

The liquid part (with the highest boiling point) sinks to the bottom of the tower. Other fractions rises up the tower.

The temperature decreases up the tower. At the appropriate temperature, the fraction cools and condenses to liquid. Condensed hydrocarbons flows out and is collected.

##### Demand of petroleum fractions
The demand for a petroleum fraction is closely related to their <u>physical and chemical properties</u>.

Generally, **smaller molecule hydrocarbons** make better fuels as they are more volatile, more flammable and burn with a less sooty flame.

##### Uses of petroleum fractions
Petroleum is used as <u>fuels</u> for [[Combustion|combustion]] or a <u>source of hydrocarbons</u> for the production of useful chemicals.

| Petroleum fraction | Uses |
| :-- | :-- |
| Refinery gas | - LPG (mostly butane) as domestic fuel and fuel for vehicles<br>- Raw materials for producing other chemicals |
| Petrol (gasoline) | - Fuel for motor cars |
| Naphtha | - Raw materials for producing town gas, plastics and other chemicals |
| Kerosene | - Fuel for aeroplanes<br>- Domestic fuel |
| Diesel oil | - Fuel for heavy vehicles (e.g. lorries, buses) |
| Fuel oil | - Fuel for ships<br>- Fuel for generating electricity in power plants |
| Lubricating oil and waxes | - Making lubricating oil for machines and candles |
| Bitumen | - Covering roads |

> **Note**:
> Butane is the raw material for production of town gas.
