#### Structural isomerism
Structural isomers all have the <u>same molecular formula</u>.

##### Chain isomerism
**Chain isomers** are isomers that have the <u>same functional group</u> but <u>different carbon skeletons</u>.
- In general, they have <u>similar chemical properties</u> because they possess the <u>same functional group</u>.

**Examples**:
- Chain isomers of $\ce{C5H12}$
  ![[c5h12_skeletal.webp|150]] ![[c5h12_methyl_skeletal.webp|150]]

##### Position isomerism
**Position isomers** are isomers that have the <u>same carbon skeleton and functional group</u>. They <u>differ in the position of the functional group</u>.
- In general, they have <u>similar chemical properties</u> because they possess the <u>same functional group</u>.

**Examples**:
- Positiojn isomers of $\ce{C5H12O}$

##### Functional group isomerism
**Functional group isomers** are isomers that contain <u>different functional group</u>.
- They have <u>different chemical properties</u> as they have <u>different functional groups</u>.

**Examples**:
- Functional group isomers of $\ce{C4H10O}$

#### Stereoisomerism
**Stereoisomers** are isomers that have the <u>same arrangement of atoms</u>, but have <u>different spatial arrangement</u>.

##### *Cis-trans* isomerism (geometric isomers)
***Cis-trans* isomers**, also **geometric isomers**, are isomers with different spatial arrangements due to the <u>restricted rotation</u> of $\ce{C=C}$ double bond.

**Chemical and physical properties**:
*Cis-trans* isomers show <u>similar (or the same) chemical properties</u> because they possess exactly the <u>sane functional group</u>.

![[cis-trans_polar_non-polar.webp|400]]

*Cis* isomers would have a higher boiling point than *trans* isomers.
- This is because *cis* isomers are polar, while *trans* isomers are non-polar.
- The van der Waals' force between *cis* molecules is stronger than that in *trans* molecules <u>in liquid state</u>.

*Trans* isomers would have a higher melting point than *cis* isomers.
- This is because *trans* isomers have a higher packing efficiency than *cis* isomers.
- The van der Waals' force between *trans* molecules is stronger than that in *cis* molecules <u>in solid state</u>.

##### Enantiomerism
**Enantiomers** are two <u>non-identical molecules</u> with atoms or groups of atoms arranged in different positions.

**Properties**:
- Non-superimposable with mirror image
- Chiral
- No plane of symmetry

> [!note]
> Students are only required to identify enantiomers with one chiral centre. However, carbon compounds with more than one chiral centres may not exhibit enantiomerism.

**Enantiomers** are composed by the same atoms, they have the same molecular size and molecular polarity. Therefore, they have the <u>same physical properties</u>.

However, there are differences in their <u>interactions with polarized light (optical activity)</u>. This can be measured using a <span style="color: skyblue">polarimeter</span>.
- **Rotates clockwise**: (+)-isomer
- **Rotates anticlockwise**: (-)-isomer

They also have the <u>same chemical properties</u> as they have the same chemical bonds. They also have the <u>same standard enthalpy change of formation</u>.
