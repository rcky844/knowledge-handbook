**Substitution reaction** is a reaction that involves the replacement of an atom (or a group of atoms) of an organic molecule by another atom (or groups of atoms).

#### Alkanes
##### Reaction with halogens
![[substitution_alkane_halogen.webp|500]]

> alkanes → haloalkanes
> ━━━━━━━━━━
> **Reagent**: $\ce{F2}$ / $\ce{Cl2}$ / $\ce{Br2}$ / $\ce{I2}$ dissolved in organic solvent (e.g. $\ce{CCl4}$)
> **Condition**: Under sunlight ($h\nu$) / heating
> **Observations**: Colour changes <span style="color: lightgreen">slowly</span> (compared to addition reaction)
> **Application**: [[Testing for alkanes and alkenes]]

**Steps of substitution** (free radical process):
1. **Initiation** (Production of free radicals)

2. **Propagation**
   ![[free_radical_propagation.webp|500]]

3. **Termination**
   ![[free_radical_termination.webp|320]]

- To prevent forming molecules with more of its atoms substituted, use <u>large excess amount of hydrocarbons</u>. It should be controlled with the mole ratio between hydrocarbons and $\ce{Cl2}$ molecules.
- The free radical substitution process is a [[Redox Reactions, Chemical Cells and Electrolysis|redox reaction]].

##### Substitution with $\ce{OH-}$
![[alcohol_sub_oh.webp|400]]

> haloalkane → alcohol
> ━━━━━━━━━━
> **Reagent**: Dilute $\ce{NaOH}$ / $\ce{KOH}$
> **Condition**: Heating (increase the rate of reaction)

**Rate of reaction of the haloalkane**:
$\ce{C-I}$ > $\ce{C-Br}$ > $\ce{C-Cl}$ > $\ce{C-F}$

#### Alcohol
##### Substitution with $\ce{X-}$
###### By $\ce{H-X}$
$\ce{R-OH + HCl -> R-Cl + H2O}$

> alcohol → haloalkane
> ━━━━━━━━━━
> **Reagent**: Conc. $\ce{HCl}$ / $\ce{HBr}$ / $\ce{HI}$
> **Condition**: Under reflux

###### By $\ce{PX3}$
$\ce{3R-OH + PCl3 -> 3R-Cl + H3PO4}$

> alcohol → haloalkane
> ━━━━━━━━━━
> **Reagent**: $\ce{PCl3}$ / $\ce{PBr3}$ / $\ce{PI3}$
> **Condition**: Under reflux
