**Substitution reaction** is a reaction that involves the replacement of an atom (or a group of atoms) of an organic molecule by another atom (or groups of atoms).

#### Alkanes
##### Reaction with halogens

> **Reagent**: $\ce{F2}$ / $\ce{Cl2}$ / $\ce{Br2}$ / $\ce{I2}$ dissolved in organic solvent (e.g. $\ce{CCl4}$)
> **Condition**: Under sunlight ($h\nu$) / heating
> **Observations**: Colour changes <u>slowly</u> (compared to addition reaction)

**Steps of substitution** (free radical process):

1. **Initiation** (Production of free radicals)

2. **Propagation**

3. **Termination**

- To prevent forming molecules with more of its atoms substituted, use <u>large excess amount of hydrocarbons</u>. It should be controlled with the mole ratio between hydrocarbons and $\ce{Cl2}$ molecules.
- The free radical substitution process is a [[Redox Reactions, Chemical Cells and Electrolysis|redox reaction]].
