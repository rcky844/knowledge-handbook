**Cracking** is the breaking down of a large hydrocarbon molecule into <u>smaller alkanes and alkenes</u>.

*Importance of cracking*:
- Production of extra petrol to meet demands
- Produce alkenes (raw material for making other chemicals, e.g. plastics)

*Types of cracking*:
- Thermal cracking
- Catalytic cracking
