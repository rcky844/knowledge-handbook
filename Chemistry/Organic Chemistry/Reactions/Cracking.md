**Cracking** is a thermal decomposition reaction to break down a larger chain hydrocarbon molecule into <span class="hi-blue">smaller alkanes and alkenes</span>.

*Importance of cracking*:
- Production of extra petrol to meet demands
- Produce alkenes (raw material for making other chemicals, e.g. plastics)

*Types of cracking*:
- Thermal cracking
- Catalytic cracking

> [!tip]
> When a long chain alkane is cracked, there aren't enough hydrogen atoms to make two alkanes. Hence, cracking will usually <span class="hi-green">produce one alkane and one alkene</span>.

# Catalytic cracking
**Catalytic cracking** breaks down the large alkanes to <span class="hi-blue">smaller alkanes and alkenes</span> with the help of <span class="hi-blue">heat and catalyst</span> in the <span class="hi-green">absence of oxygen</span>.

# Thermal cracking
**Thermal cracking** is a process of cracking where vaporised long chain alkane is mixed with steam at very high temperatures, and does not involve a catalyst.
