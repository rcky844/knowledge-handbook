> alkanoic acid + alcohol ⇌ ester (Reversible reaction)
> ━━━━━━━━━━
> **Reagent**: Conc. $\ce{H2SO4}$
> **Condition**: Under reflux

*Functions of the reagent*:
- **As a catalyst**
  Addition of sulphuric acid will <span class="hi-green">speed up the reaction</span> and therefore the equilibrium is achieved more quickly.

- **As a dehydrating agent**
  Sulphuric acid helps in <span class="hi-green">removing the water content</span> of the reaction, and shifts the equilibrium position to the product side.
