> alkanoic acid + alcohol ⇌ ester (Reversible reaction)
> ━━━━━━━━━━
> **Reagent**: Conc. $\ce{H2SO4}$
> **Condition**: Under reflux

**Functions of the reagent**:
- **As a catalyst**
  Addition of sulphuric acid will <u>speed up the reaction</u> and therefore the equilibrium is achieved more quickly.

- **As a dehydrating agent**
  Sulphuric acid helps in <u>removing the water content</u> of the reaction, and shifts the equilibrium position to the product side.
