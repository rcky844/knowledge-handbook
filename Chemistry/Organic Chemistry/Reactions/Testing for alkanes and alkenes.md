**Situation**: There are two tubes containing either an alkane (e.g. hexane) and alkene (e.g. hex-1-ene). Suggest a chemical test to distinguish between them.

*Method*:
1. Add $\ce{Br2}$ (dissolved in organic solvent) into the solution in the dark.
2. Add $\ce{KMnO4/H+}$ into the solutions.

*Observation*:
1. If $\ce{Br2}$ changes from brown to colourless <span style="color: lightgreen">rapidly</span>, then it is alkene.
   The solution which remains unchanged will be the alkane.
2. If $\ce{KMnO4/H+}$ changes from purple to very pale pink <span style="color: lightgreen">rapidly</span>, then it is the alkene.
   The solution which remains unchanged will be the alkane.
