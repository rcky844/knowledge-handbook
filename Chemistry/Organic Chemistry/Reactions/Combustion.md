**Combustion** is an <u>exothermic reaction</u>. It can be used to drive machines.

**General equation** (for <u>complete combustion</u>):
$\ce{C_x H_y + (x+{y\over4})O2 -> xCO_2 + {y\over2}H2O}$

**Incomplete combustion** occurs when the supply for oxygen is limited. The fuel burns to form $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{CO}$, $\ce{C}$ and $\ce{H2O}$. Carbon produced will be released as <span style="color: skyblue">soot</span>, a black smoke can be seen.

#### Consequences of combustion
| Pollutants | Effect | Remedies |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| $\ce{CO}$  | - Binds to haemoglobin and reduces oxygen-carrying capacity. | - Install catalytic converters in motor vehicles<br>- Supply sufficient $\ce{O2}$ during combustion |
| $\ce{SO2}$ | - Causes acid rain<br>- Irritant to the respiratory system | - Replacing diesel oil with LPG for motor vehicles<br>- Use fuels of low S content<br>- Installing scrubbers at power plants |
| $\ce{NO_x}$<br>($\ce{NO}$, $\ce{NO2}$) | - Causes acid rain and photochemical smog<br>- Irritant to the respiratory system | - Install catalytic converters in motor vehicles |
| Unburnt hydrocarbons | - Carcinogenic<br>- Causes photochemical smog | - Install catalytic converters in motor vehicles |
| Suspended particles | - Carcinogenic<br>- Irritant to the respiratory system | - Use electronic precipitators in power plants<br>- Remove dust by mechanical filtering of water gas |
| Lead compounds | - Poisonous<br>- Causes anaemia<br>- Causes neurological issues | Use unlead fuels |

> [!note]
> - These air pollutants are all formed from the combustion of substances.
> - The pollutants $\ce{CO}$, unburnt hydrocarbons and suspended particles are formed from incomplete combustion.
> - The pollutants $\ce{SO2}$ and $\ce{NO_x}$ are formed from combustion of $\ce{S}$ and $\ce{N2}$ respectively.
> - Lead compounds were added to fuels for cars in the past, and were removed due to its effects on humans.

##### Household hazards
- **Carbon monoxide poisoning**
  Town gas is mixed with $\ce{CO}$, which is poisonous. Leakage of town gas may cause carbon monoxide poisoning.

- **Fire and explosions**
  Town gas contains flammable (hydrocarbons) and explosive substances ($\ce{H2}$).

##### Global warming
**Example**: HKCEE 2006 Q6(c)(i)
Greenhouse gases (e.g. $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{CH4}$, $\ce{H2O}$) can trap heat which is reradiated from the Earth, creating greenhouse effect to keep the atmosphere warm for life to sustain on Earth, but excessive amounts traps too much heat and causes global warming.

> [!note]
> $\ce{CO2}$ is from the combustion of fossil fuels, where as $\ce{CH4}$ from the decaying of the remains of rice paddies / cattle.

**Negative effects**:
- **Melting of polar ice sheets**: Results in a rise in sea levels and endangers low land areas.
- **Climate change**: Increases extreme weather conditions.
- Endangers wildlife

**Remedial measures** ($\ce{CO2}$):
- Burn less fossil fuels and use alternative energy sources (e.g. nuclear energy, wind energy, solar energy, HEP, etc.) to generate electricity. 
- Use $\ce{H2}$ as fuel ([[hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell]]) in cars.
- Stop deforestation and plant more trees.
- Prevent & put out forest fires.

**Remedial measures** ($\ce{CH4}$):
- Collect it from biomass and used as a fuel (it is part of refinery gas).

> [!note]
> - Nuclear energy is not a form of renewable energy.
> - However, large amounts of energy can be produced from a nuclear reactor.
> - Nuclear waste can be difficult to process and handle.

##### Oil spillages
- Some components of oil is toxic to marine life.
- The layer of oil blocks oxygen supply of marine life.
- Oil is flammable, releasing mass amounts of pollutants to air.

#### Solutions for pollution
##### Catalytic converters
**Catalytic converters** are installed to vehicles to reduce the amount of pollutants ($\ce{NO_x}$, $\ce{CO}$, unburnt hydrocarbons and soot / suspended particulates) in the exhaust.

They contain <span style="color: skyblue">catalysts (Pt / Pd)</span> to <span style="color: lightgreen">speed up the rate of reaction</span>.
- Leaded fuels should not be used with catalytic converters, as it would <u>'poison' the catalyst</u>.
- Catalytic converters are shaped like a <span style="color: lightgreen">honeycomb / beehive</span>, this is to <u>increase the surface area for reaction</u>.

**Reactions**:
- Combination of $\ce{CO}$ and $\ce{NO_x}$
  $\ce{2CO(g) + 2NO(g) ->[Pt] 2CO2(g) + N2(g)}$
  $\ce{4CO(g) + 2NO2(g) ->[Pt] 4CO2(g) + N2(g)}$

- Direct removal of $\ce{CO}$
  $\ce{2CO(g) + O2(g) ->[Pt] 2CO2(g)}$

- Combustion of unburnt hydrocarbons
  $\ce{C_x H_y + (x+{y\over4})O2 ->[Pt] xCO_2 + {y\over2}H2O}$

**Harmless products produced**: $\ce{N2}$, $\ce{H2O}$, $\ce{CO2}$

##### Scrubbers
**Scrubbers** involve the use of $\ce{CaO}$ or $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$ to remove $\ce{SO2(g)}$.

**Reactions**:
- $\ce{SO2 (g) + CaO (s) -> CaSO3(s)}$
- $\ce{SO2 (g) + Ca(OH)2 (s) -> CaSO3(s) + H2O (â„“)}$

##### Electronic precipitators
**Electronic precipitators** are installed in power plants to <u>reduce the emission of suspended particulates only</u>, which are generally large in size.

Dirty gases pass through a strong electric field where the particulates would be charged. The charged particulates are then collected on plates of opposite charges.
