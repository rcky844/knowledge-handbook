**Hydrocarbons** are organic compounds comprised <span class="hi-green">exclusively of carbon and hydrogen</span>.

# Types
- **Aliphatic hydrocarbons**
  Carbon compounds with carbon atoms are joined together in <span class="hi-blue">straight chains, branched chains or non-aromatic rings</span>.

- **Aromatic hydrocarbons**
  Carbon compounds with one or more <span class="hi-blue">benzene rings</span>.

# Sources
## Coal
**Coal** is a combustible sedimentary rock containing over 50% of carbon by mass, and also contains trace amounts of <span class="hi-blue">sulphur and nitrogen</span> compounds.

*Usage*: Generating electricity

> [!tip]
> Combustion of coal causes environmental problems (e.g. acid rain) as it contains impurities (elements S & N) that forms acidic oxides.

*Formation*:
- Remains of ancient plants were <span class="hi-green">deeply buried under layers of sand and mud</u>.
- <span class="hi-blue">High temperature, pressure and the action of bacteria</span> slowly convert the plant remains into coal.

## Petroleum and natural gas
**Petroleum**, also **crude oil**, is a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons. **Natural gas** is a gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons, with the main component being <span class="hi-blue">methane</span> ($\ce{CH4}$).

*Formation*:
- Large quantities of dead <span class="hi-blue">marine organisms</span> (e.g. planktons and algaes) are buried underneath sedimentary rocks.
- Their remains are subjected to <span class="hi-green">intense heat and pressure</span> for a long time.

### Petroleum fractions
*Main article: [[Fractional distillation of petroleum]]*

Direct [[Combustion|combustion]] of petroleum is wasteful. **Petroleum fractions** are usually obtained from refining petroleum as some fractions have useful purposes other than composition.

#### Demand and uses of fractions
Petroleum is used as <u>fuels</u> for [[Combustion|combustion]] or a <u>source of hydrocarbons</u> for the production of useful chemicals.
- The demand for a petroleum fraction is closely related to their <u>physical and chemical properties</u>.
- Generally, <span class="hi-green">smaller chain hydrocarbons</span> make better fuels as they are <span class="hi-blue">more volatile, more flammable</span> and burn with a less sooty flame.

| Petroleum fraction | Uses |
| :-- | :-- |
| Refinery gas | - LPG (mostly butane) as domestic fuel and fuel for vehicles<br>- Raw materials for producing other chemicals |
| Petrol (gasoline) | - Fuel for motor cars |
| Naphtha | - Raw materials for producing town gas, plastics and other chemicals |
| Kerosene | - Fuel for aeroplanes<br>- Domestic fuel |
| Diesel oil | - Fuel for heavy vehicles (e.g. lorries, buses) |
| Fuel oil | - Fuel for ships<br>- Fuel for generating electricity in power plants |
| Lubricating oil and waxes | - Making lubricating oil for machines and candles |
| Bitumen | - Covering roads |

> [!tip]
> Naphtha and natural gas is the raw material for production of town gas.
