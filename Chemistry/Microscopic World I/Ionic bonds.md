**Ionic bond** is the electrostatic force of attraction between cations and anions.

#### Ionization
![[ionic_bond_form.webp|450]]
- Group I, II and III elements tend to lose outermost shell electron(s) to attain duplet / octet structure, becoming cations (+).
- Group V, VI and VII elements tend to gain outermost shell electron(s) to attain duplet / octet structure, becoming anions (-).
- Group IV and 0 elements generally do not form ions.

â†’ Ionic compounds are formed during an electron transferring process between a metal and a non-metal.

#### Example
For $\ce{Li2O}$:
