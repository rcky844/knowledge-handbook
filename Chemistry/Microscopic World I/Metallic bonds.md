**Metallic bond** is the electrostatic force of attraction between metallic ions and a 'sea' of delocalized electrons. They exist in metals (metallic elements) only.

In metals, metallic atoms tend to lose their outermost shell electrons to become a positively charged ion. This process is called <u>ionization</u>.

The atoms of metals are closely packed together. The outermost shell electron of each atom continually moves from one atom to another. They are called delocalized electrons.

> **Note**:
> There are no anions formed in an metallic bond, only cations.
