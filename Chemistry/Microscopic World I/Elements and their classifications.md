*Pre-context: [[Classification of matter]]*

#### Elements and atoms
- The building blocks of elements are atoms. All elements are made up of atoms.
- Different elements have different atoms. The different elements are represented by different symbols.

#### Classification of elements
Elements are classified into:
- Metals
- Non-metals
- Semi-metals / Metalloids
↪️ Different classes of elements have completely different physical and chemical properties.

> **Trivia**:
> The most abundant element (overall) on Earth is <u>oxygen</u>, while the most abundant metal on Earth is <u>aluminium</u>.

##### Metals
*Main article: [[Metals]]*

Metals share some typical physical properties, such as:
- Shiny appearance
- Good conductors of electricity and heat
- High melting points and boiling points
- Ductility
- Melleability

Refer to "[[Giant metallic structure]]" and "[[Metallic bonds]]" for the explanation of the chemical and physical properties.

##### Non-metals
Non-metals share some typical properties, such as:
- Dull appearance
- Poor conductors of electricity and heat
- Low melting points and boiling points
- Brittle (for solids)

Refer to "[[Simple molecular structure]]" / "[[Giant covalent structure]]" and "[[Covalent bonds]]" for the explanation of the chemical and physical properties.

##### Semi-metals / metalloids
Metalloids have some properties similar to those of metals and some similar to those of non-metals. Different metalloids have different physical and chemical properties, some properties of silicon is stated below:

| Property | Details |
| :--: | :--: |
| state at room temperature and pressure | solid |
| melting point and boiling point | high |
| appearance | some are grey and shiny crystals while some are brown powder |
| electrical conductivity | crystalline form conducts electricity, brown form does not conduct electricity |
| effect of bending and hammering | brittle |

**Usage**: For making semi-conductors / computer chips
