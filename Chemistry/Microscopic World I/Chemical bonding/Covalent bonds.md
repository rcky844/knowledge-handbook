A **covalent bond** is the electrostatic force of attraction between bonded atoms / between the bond pair electrons (-ve) and the protons of the bonded atoms.

- Elements of non-metals or compounds made up of non-metals would usually posses covalent bonds.
- Covalent bonding involves <u>electron sharing</u>. Non-metallic atoms try to attain stable electronic arrangements by sharing electrons, leading to the formation of <u>molecules</u>.

The pairs of electrons involved in bonding are called <span style="color: violet">bond pair electrons</span>, while the pairs of electrons not involved in bonding are called <span style="color: violet">lone pair electrons</span>.

#### Dative covalent bonds
> **Definition**:
> A **dative covalent bond** is a covalent bond in which the bond pair electrons are provided by the same atom.

##### Ammonium ion ($\ce{NH4+}$)
![[nh4_form.webp|500]]
The **ammonium ion** is formed in the acid base reaction: $\ce{NH3 + H+ -> NH4+}$.
- Bond pair electrons are provided by nitrogen atom of ammonia molecule.

##### Hydronium ion ($\ce{H3O+}$)
![[h3o_form.webp|500]]
The **hydronium ion** is formed in the acid base reaction: $\ce{H+ + H2O -> H3O+}$.
- Bond pair electrons are provided by oxygen atom of water molecule.

##### Ammonium borane molecule ($\ce{NH3BF3}$)

##### Describing formation
**Example**: 2013 HKDSE LQ Q2
$\ce{BF3}$ reacts with $\ce{NH3}$ to give $\ce{F3BNH2}$. Describe the bond formation between $\ce{BF3}$ and $\ce{NH3}$.
- In $\ce{BF3}$, there is a vacant site of the outermost electron shell in $\ce{B}$ atom.
- By accepting the lone pair electrons from $\ce{N}$ in $\ce{NH3}$, $\ce{B}$ in $\ce{BF3}$ attains a stable electronic configuration like neon / a stable octet electronic configuration.

**Example**: 2017 HKDSE LQ Q3
Describe the formation of dative covalent bond using $\ce{H3O+}$ as example.
- There is a vacant site of the outermost electron shell in $\ce{H+}$ ion.
- By accepting the lone pair electrons from $\ce{O}$ in $\ce{H2O}$, $\ce{H+}$ attains a stable electronic configuration like helium / a stable <u>duplet</u> electronic configuration.

> **Note**:
> Similar to demand / supply:
> - There is a demand for electrons to attain stable electronic configuration.
> - There is also a supply of lone pair electrons.
