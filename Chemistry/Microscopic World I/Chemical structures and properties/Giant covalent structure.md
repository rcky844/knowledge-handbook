In a giant covalent structure, covalent bonds exist between the atoms. The network of covalent bonds and atoms extends throughout the whole structure.

Examples of substances with this structure includes:
- Diamond ($\ce{C}$)
- Graphite ($\ce{C}$)
- Quartz ($\ce{SiO2}$)

> **Note**:
> - Diamond and graphite are allotropes of carbon.
> - Allotropes are different forms of the same element in which the atoms or molecules are arranged in different ways.

#### Examples
##### Diamond
![[diamond_drawing.webp|400]]
In diamond, <u>each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with other carbon atoms</u>. The carbon atoms are tetrahedrally arranged around each other. The network of carbon atoms extends throughout the whole structure, resulting in a giant covalent structure.
- All electrons are used to form covalent bonds, no free electrons are available for conducting electricity.

##### Graphite
![[graphite_drawing.webp|500]]
In graphite, the carbon atoms are arranged in <u>flat parallel layers</u>.
- Within each layer, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other atoms, forming a hexagonal arrangement. Since 3 out of 4 outermost shell electrons of carbon are bonded, the remaining electrons are delocalized along the layers of carbon atoms.
- There are weak van der Waals' forces between the adjacent graphene layers in graphite.

##### Quartz
![[quartz_drawing.webp|400]]
In a quartz crystal, <u>each silicon is joined to four oxygen atoms</u> by covalent bonds while each oxygen atom is joined to two silicon atoms by covalent bonds.
- The giant covalent structure consists of covalent bonds, with overall ration of silicon to oxygen as 1:2. Hence, the chemical formula of quartz is $\ce{SiO2}$ (empirical formula).

#### Hardness
They are <u>hard</u> in general. This is because the relative motion of the atoms is restricted by the strong covalent bonds.
- However, graphite are relatively soft due to the presence of weak van der Waals' forces between graphene layers.

This relates to the uses of the substances:
- Diamond is hard enough to be used to cut stones.
- Graphite is used as lubricant and in lead pencils.
  The graphene layer can easily slide over each other and leave a black mark.

#### Electrical conductivity
They are mostly poor electrical conductors.
- Graphite is a good conductor of electricity. When voltage is applied, the delocalized electrons can move along the layers. It can be used to make electrodes.

#### Heat conductivity
They are mostly poor heat conductors.
- Graphite is a good conductor of heat, as there are delocalized electrons that can collide with each other in its structure.

#### Melting points and boiling points
They have <u>high melting points and boiling points</u> in general.
- To melt / boil them, lots of heat is required to break the covalent bonds between the atoms.

#### Solubility in aqueous and organic solvents
They are <u>insoluble</u> in aqueous solvent and organic solvents.
- Substances with giant covalent structure are insoluble in water as the covalent bonds between the atoms and the intermolecular force (hydrogen bond) between water molecules are not of comparable strength.
- Substances with giant covalent structure are insoluble in organic solvents as the covalent bonds between the atoms and the intermolecular force (van der Waals' force) between molecules in organic solvent are not of comparable strength
