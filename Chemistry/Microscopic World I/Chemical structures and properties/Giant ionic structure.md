*Pre-context: [[Ionic bonds]]*

Ionic compounds have giant ionic structure. The ionic compounds are closely packed in a regular pattern of a lattice.

#### Labelled diagrams of giant ionic structure
![[nacl_structure.webp|400]]
Sodium chloride ($\ce{NaCl}$) ⤴️
- **1:6 coordination**
  Each ion is surrounded by 6 ions of the opposite charge.

![[cscl_structure.webp||400]]
Caesium chloride ($\ce{CsCl}$) ⤴️
- **1:8 coordination**
  Each ion is surrounded by 8 ions of the opposite charge.

#### Hardness
Ionic compounds are <u>hard</u> as the relative motions of the ions are restricted by the strong ionic bonds. However, they are also brittle.

**Example**: HKDSE 2013 LQ Q8
Explain why solid caesium chloride is brittle.
- Caesium chloride has a giant ionic structure with the ionic bond between $\ce{Cs+}$ ion and $\ce{Cl-}$ ion.
- When force is applied, ions of the same charge will come together and cause repulsion.

#### Melting points and boiling points
Ionic compounds have <u>high melting points and boiling points</u> in general.
- To melt / biol an ionic compound, lots of heat energy is required to break the ionic bond between the cations and anions.

#### Electrical conductivity
Ionic compounds can conduct electricity when it is in aqueous or molten states (an electrolyte).
- Solid ionic compounds do not conduct electricity as their ions are not mobiles, nor are there any delocalized electrons in their structures.
- The ions in ionic compounds become mobile when the compound dissolves in water (aqueous state) or melted (molten state).

#### Solubility in aqueous and organic solvents
Ionic compounds are usually soluble in aqueous solvent (e.g. $\ce{NaCl}$, $\ce{CaCl2}$, $\ce{MgSO4}$), some ionic compounds are insoluble (e.g. $\ce{PbCl2}$, $\ce{Fe(OH)2}$, $\ce{AgCl}$).
