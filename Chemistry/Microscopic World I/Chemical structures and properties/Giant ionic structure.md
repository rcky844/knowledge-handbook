*Pre-context: [[Ionic bonds]]*

Ionic compounds have giant ionic structure. The ionic compounds are closely packed in a regular pattern of a lattice.

#### Labelled diagrams of giant ionic structure
![[nacl_structure.webp|400]]
Sodium chloride ($\ce{NaCl}$) ⤴️
- **1:6 coordination**
  Each ion is surrounded by 6 ions of the opposite charge.

![[cscl_structure.webp||400]]
Caesium chloride ($\ce{CsCl}$) ⤴️
- **1:8 coordination**
  Each ion is surrounded by 8 ions of the opposite charge.

#### Hardness
Ionic compounds are <u>hard</u> as the relative motions of the ions are restricted by the strong ionic bonds. However, they are also brittle.

**Example**: HKDSE 2013 LQ Q8
Explain why solid caesium chloride is brittle.
- Caesium chloride has a giant ionic structure with the ionic bond between $\ce{Cs+}$ ion and $\ce{Cl-}$ ion.
- When force is applied, ions of the same charge will come together and cause repulsion.

#### Melting points and boiling points
Ionic compounds have <u>high melting points and boiling points</u> in general.
- To melt / biol an ionic compound, lots of heat energy is required to break the ionic bond between the cations and anions.

#### Electrical conductivity
Ionic compounds can conduct electricity when it is in aqueous or molten states (an electrolyte).
- Solid ionic compounds do not conduct electricity as their ions are not mobiles, nor are there any delocalized electrons in their structures.
- The ions in ionic compounds become mobile when the compound dissolves in water (aqueous state) or melted (molten state).

#### Solubility in aqueous and organic solvents
Ionic compounds are usually soluble in aqueous solvent (e.g. $\ce{NaCl}$, $\ce{CaCl2}$, $\ce{MgSO4}$), some ionic compounds are insoluble (e.g. $\ce{PbCl2}$, $\ce{Fe(OH)2}$, $\ce{AgCl}$).
- Ionic compounds are soluble in water as the ionic bonds between the ions and the intermolecular force (hydrogen bond) between water molecules are of comparable strength.
- Ionic compounds are insoluble in organic solvents as the ionic bonds between the ions and the intermolecular force (van der Waals' force) between molecules in organic solvent are not of comparable strength.

#### Colour of ions in aqueous solution
Most ions are colourless, those with colours are listed below.

| Chemical formula | Colour |
| :--: | :--: |
| $\ce{Fe^2+}$ | pale green |
| $\ce{Fe^3+}$ | yellow or brown |
| $\ce{Cu^2+}$ | blue or green |
| $\ce{Co^2+}$ | pink |
| $\ce{Cr^3+}$ | green |
| $\ce{Ni^2+}$ | green |
| $\ce{CrO4^2-}$ | yellow |
| $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$ | orange |
| $\ce{Mn^2+}$ | very pale pink |
| $\ce{MnO4-}$ | purple |
#### Migration of ions
*See also: [[Electrolysis]]*
Negative ions are attracted to positive ions. By passing electricity through ionic compounds, cations move towards the negative electrode, while anions move towards the positive electrodes.
