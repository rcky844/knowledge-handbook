**Chromatography** can be used for separating different solutes in a solution.

**Types**:
- Paper chromatography
- Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
- Column chromatography

**Phases**:
- Stationary phase (fixed in position)
- Mobile phase (moves in one direction)

| Chromatography | Stationary phase | Mobile phase | Application |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Paper chromatography | Water film on paper | Developing solvent<br>(alcohol-water solvent) | Separation & identification |
| Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) | Silica gel ($\ce{SiO2}$) & Alumina ($\ce{Al2O3}$) | Developing solvent<br>(depends on experiment) | Separation & identification |
| Column chromatography | Silica gel ($\ce{SiO2}$) & Alumina ($\ce{Al2O3}$) | Eluting solvent<br>(depends on experiment) | Separation & identification + Retainment of component |

# Paper chromatography
![[paper_chromatgraphy.webp|400]]

**Phases**:
- A thin film of water is held by the cellulose fibres in the paper. The water film of the paper acts as the <span style="color: violet">stationary phase</span>.
- The <span class="hi-blue">developing solvent</span> (alcohol-water) mixture acts as the <span style="color: violet">mobile phase</span>.

**Process**:
- A baseline is drawn with a pencil across the bottom of a strip of filter paper.
- A drop of black ink is added on the baseline and allowed to dry.
- The paper is then suspended in an alcohol-water mixture (developing solvent), with the ink spot above the solvent level.

> [!warning]
> The level of the solvent should not be higher than the baseline.

**Separation of components**:
![[paper_chromatography_separated.webp|420]]
<span class="hi-blue">Different components</span> (with different colours) <span class="hi-green">have different absorptivities / solubilities in the mobile phase and stationery phase</span>.
- The <span class="hi-green"><u>more soluble</u></span> the component in <span style="color: aqua">stationary phase</span>, the <span class="hi-orange">slower</span> it travels up the stationary phase.
- The <span class="hi-green"><u>more soluble</u></span> the component in <span style="color: aqua">mobile phase</span>, the <span class="hi-orange">faster</span> it travels up the stationary phase.

**Example**: HKDSE 2019 Paper 2 Q3(c)(iii)
Explain briefly why chromatography can be used to separate a mixture.
- Different components have different solubilities / absorptivities in mobile phase and stationary phase.

## Calculation of retention ratio
$R_f$ values (retention ratio) can be used for identification of components.
$$
R_f\,\,\text{value} = {\text{distance travelled by the component}\over\text{distance travelled by the solvent}}
$$

**Example**: HKDSE 2018 Paper 2 Q3(a)(iii)
What is meaning of the '$R_f$ value' of a substance in a paper chromatogram?
- $R_f$ value is the ratio of distance traveled by the component to the distance traveled by the solvent front.

**Example**: HKDSE 2020 Paper 2 Q3(b)(i-iii)
The chromatograms from thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of aspirin, caffeine, acetaminophen and a drug Y are shown below.
![[2020_p2_q3b.webp|600]]

(i) Draw a labelled diagram for the set-up in performing a TLC experiment.
![[2020_p2_q3bi.webp|240]]

(ii) Calculate the $R_f$ value for aspirin.
$$
R_f = {{45}\over{130-10-20}} = 0.45
$$

(iii) Based on the chromatograms provided, suggest whether drug Y would contain aspirin, caffeine or acetaminophen.
- Aspirin
- Caffeine

# Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
- A thin layer of <span class="hi-blue">silica gel</span> ($\ce{SiO2}$) or <span class="hi-blue">alumina powder</span> ($\ce{Al2O3}$), usually coated on <span style="color: violet">glass, aluminium or plastic plate</span>, will be used as the <span class="hi-green"><u>stationary phase</u></span>.
- The <span class="hi-blue">developing solvent</span> acts as the <span class="hi-green"><u>mobile phase</u></span>.

**Advantages over paper chromatograpy**:
- It has a <span class="hi-green">higher speed</span>.
- It requires a <span class="hi-green">smaller amount of sample</span>.

# Column chromatography
![[column_chromatography.webp|500]]
- Similar to thin-layer chromatography, but the <span class="hi-green">amounts of the sample mixture and developing solvent used are much larger</span>.
- This method of chromatography <span class="hi-green">allows for separation</span>.

**Set-up**:
- Column is held <span style="color: aqua">vertically</span>.
- <span style="color: aqua">Eluting solvent is kept adding</span> from the top and it runs through the column under <span style="color: aqua">gravitational force</span>.
- Components are separated as they move down the column.
- To perform the experiment in a <span style="color: violet">small scale</span>, <span class="hi-orange">a dropper containing alumina</span> can be used instead of a column.
