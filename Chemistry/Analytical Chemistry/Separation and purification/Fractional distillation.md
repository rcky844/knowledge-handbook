**Principle**: (by ethanol and water)
- When the mixture is heated, both ethanol and water vaporize.
- The vapour contains more ethanol and less water.
- Upon rising the column, more water condenses to liquid than ethanol.
- After repeated vaporization and condensation, the vapour at the top contains mostly ethanol. The ethanol vapour condenses to liquid in the condenser.

**Applications**:
- [[Fractional distillation of liquefied air]]
- [[Fractional distillation of petroleum]]
