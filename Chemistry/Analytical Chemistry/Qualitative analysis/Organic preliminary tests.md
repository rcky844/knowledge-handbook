#### Tests for unsaturated carbon compounds
> [!note]
> Unsaturated carbon compounds refer to compounds with $\ce{C=C}$ or $\ce{C≡C}$.

**Method 1**:
![[addition_br2.webp]]
![[addition_br2_aq.webp]]
- Add $\ce{Br2(aq)}$ / $\ce{Br2}$ <span style="color: violet">dissolved in organic solvent</span> into sample.
- The solution turns <span style="color: lightgreen">from brown to colourless</span>.

**Method 2**:
![[addition_oh.webp]]
- Add <span style="color: violet">acidified</span> $\ce{KMnO4(aq)}$ into the sample.
- The solution turns <span style="color: lightgreen">from purple to very pale pink / colourless</span>.

#### Tests for hydroxyl group (-OH)
**Method 1**: (oxidation)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Primary alcohol and secondary alcohol</span> can be oxidized by oxidizing agents (e.g. $\ce{Cr2O7^2-/H+(aq)}$).
- <span style="color: skyblue">Tertiary alcohol</span> is oxidation-resistant and cannot react with oxidizing agents.

*Details*:
- Add <span style="color: violet">acidified</span> $\ce{KMnO4(aq)}$ into the sample.
- The solution turns <span style="color: lightgreen">from purple to very pale pink / colourless</span>.

**Method 2**: ([[esterification]])
- Heat the sample with $\ce{CH3COOH(aq)}$ under the presence of concentrated $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$ under reflux.
- A <span style="color: aqua">fruity smell</span> (of the ester) is detected.

#### Tests for carboxyl group (-COOH)
**Method 1**: (reaction with sodium hydrogencarbonate)
$$
\ce{2RCOOH + Na2CO3 -> 2RCOO^-Na^+ + H2O + CO2}
$$
- Add $\ce{NaHCO3(aq)}$ solution into the sample.
- Colourless gas bubble is given out.

**Method 2**: ([[esterification]])
- Heat the sample with $\ce{CH3CH2OH(aq)}$ under the presence of concentrated $\ce{H2SO4(aq)}$ under reflux.
- A <span style="color: aqua">fruity smell</span> (of the ester) is detected.

#### Tests for carbonyl group (![[carbonyl.webp|40]])
<span style="color: lightgreen">Carbonyl groups are present in aldehyde and ketones.</span> They can be tested with the chemical reagent <span style="color: violet">2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine</span>.
![[24-dnp.webp|320]]
<!-- \chemfig{[:-150]*6(-(-NO_2)=(-N(-[2]H)-N(-[2]N)-H)-=-(-NO_2)=)} NO_2 is not aligned -->
The reaction between aldehyde and ketone produces a <span style="color: aqua">red / yellow / orange precipitate</span> called 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone.
![[24-dnp_reaction.webp]]
<!-- \raisebox{1cm}{\chemfig{[:-150]*6(-(-NO_2)=(-N(-[2]H)-N=C(-[3]R)(-[5]R'\,or\,H))-=-(-NO_2)=)}} \quad + \quad \ce{H2O}
\chemfig{C(-[3]R)(-[5]R'\,or\,H)=O}\ \quad + \quad \raisebox{1cm}{\chemfig{[:-150]*6(-(-NO_2)=(-N(-[2]H)-N(-[2]N)-H)-=-(-NO_2)=)}} -->

**Details**:
- Add <span style="color: violet">2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine</span> into the sample.
- <span style="color: aqua">Red / yellow / orange precipitate</span> is given out.

#### Test for only aldehyde but not ketone
<span style="color: skyblue">Tollens' reagent</span> can be used as a specific test for <span style="color: violet">aldehydes</span>.

**Production**:
$$
\begin{array} \\
\ce{2Ag+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) -> Ag2O(s) + H2O(ℓ)} \\
\ce{Ag2O(s) + H2O(ℓ) + 4NH3(aq) -> 2[Ag(NH3)2]+(aq) + 2OH-(aq)}
\end{array}
$$
- This is made by <span style="color: lightgreen">dissolving silver nitrate solution into excess ammonia</span>.
- An alkaline solution of diamminesilver(I) ion is formed.

**Testing**:
$$
\ce{RCHO + 2[Ag(NH3)2]+ + 3OH- -> RCOO- + 2Ag + 4NH3 + 2H2O}
$$
- Heat sample (aldehyde) (<u>in a water bath</u>) with Tollens' reagent.
- A <span style="color: aqua">silver mirror</span> is formed.

**Problems**:
- Tollens' reagent is <span style="color: lightgreen">explosive</span> (as it is a nitride).
  It is likely to explode on standing, so the reagent is prepared when needed.
