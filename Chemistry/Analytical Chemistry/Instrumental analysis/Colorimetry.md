**Colorimetry** is used for determining the <span class="hi-green">concentration</span> of a <u>coloured substance</u> with a <span class="hi-blue">colorimeter</span>.

# Principles
![[colorimeter.webp]]

- Visible light of suitable wavelengths are passed through the coloured sample solution.
- The <span class="hi-green">sample solution absorbs part of the light</span> and transmits the remaining part of the light. The more concentrated the coloured sample solution, the larger amount of light it absorbs.
- The fraction of light transmitted (light transmittance) is then detected, and the absorbance is shown in a meter.
- By measuring the <span class="hi-blue">light absorbance</span> of the sample solution, the value can be used to find the concentration of the solution by using a <span class="hi-blue">calibration curve</span>.

> [!tip] Solution for low colour intensity
> In order to measure absorbance of solutions with low colour intensity, reagents that can increase the colour intensity can be added. For example:
> $$
> \underset{\text{yellow}}{\ce{Fe^{3+}(aq)}} \;\ce{+}\;
> \ce{SCN-(aq)} \ce{->}
> \underset{\text{dark red}}{\ce{[FeSCN]^{2+}(aq)}}
> $$

## Complementary colour and colour filters
![[colour_wheel.webp|250]]

- A <span class="hi-blue">colour filter</span> of a <span class="hi-green">complementary colour</span> to the colour of the sample is chosen (based on the colour wheel).
- The coloured species samples <span class="hi-green">absorbs the complementary colour to a large extent</span>, so colorimetry can be more efficient.

## Calibration curve
**Calibration curves** show how the <span class="hi-blue">absorbance</span> increases when the <span class="hi-green">concentration</span> of the corresponding coloured substance increases in a solution.

### Constructing a calibration curve
1. Choose a suitable <span class="hi-blue">colour filter</span> which is of <span class="hi-blue">complementary colour</span> of the solution.
2. Put a test tube containing distilled water only (blank solution) into the colorimeter and <span class="hi-green">set its absorbance to zero</span>.
3. Prepare a set of standard solutions of the sample with <span class="hi-orange">different concentrations</span>. Record their absorbance by colorimetry separately.
4. Plot a calibration curve of <span class="hi-green"><u>absorbance</u> against <u>concentration</u></span>.

# Applications
1. Following the <u>progress</u> of reactions involving <span class="hi-green">colour changes</span>
2. Determining the <u>amount</u> of certain ingredients in <span class="hi-green">food and drugs</span>
3. Determining the <u>amount</u> of certain substances in <span class="hi-green">blood and urine</span>
