**Infrared spectroscopy** is used for identifying <span class="hi-blue">bonds and functional groups</span> in molecules. <span class="hi-orange">Infrared light</span> is used to measure the <span class="hi-green">vibration of atoms</span> with different bonds.

Vibration frequency of atoms with different types of bonds is unique, so they have different characteristics of absorption, emission and reflection. Generally, <span class="hi-green">stronger bonds and light atoms</span> will vibrate at a high stretching frequency (wavenumber).

# Infrared spectrum
**Infrared spectrum** is a plot of <span class="hi-blue">percentage of transmittance</span> (%) against the <span class="hi-blue">wavenumber</span> ($\pu{cm-1}$) of infrared radiation.

*Example*: hexan-1-ol

- The presence of (sharp) absorption peak at $\pu{2840-3095cm-1}$ corresponds to $\ce{C-H}$ bond.
- The presence of (sharp) absorption peak at $\pu{3230-3670cm-1}$ corresponds to $\ce{O-H}$ bond <span class="hi-green">for alcohol</span>.

> [!info]
> The range of absorption peak at $\pu{400-1500cm-1}$ is the <span class="hi-blue">fingerprint region</span>.

*Example*: hexanoic acid

- The presence of (sharp) absorption peak at $\pu{2840-3095cm-1}$ corresponds to $\ce{C-H}$ bond.
- The presence of (broad) absorption peak at $\pu{2500-3300cm-1}$ corresponds to $\ce{O-H}$ bond <span class="hi-green">for carboxylic acid</span>.
- The presence of (sharp) absorption peak at $\pu{1680-1800cm-1}$ corresponds to $\ce{C=O}$ bond.
