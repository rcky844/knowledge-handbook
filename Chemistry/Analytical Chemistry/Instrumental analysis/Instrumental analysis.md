**Instrumental analytical methods** can be used to determine the composition and concentration of substances in a sample using instruments.

# Instruments
- [[Colorimetry]]: Determines concentration (amount) of coloured substances in a solution by measuring <span class="hi-blue">light absorbance</span>.
- [[Infrared spectroscopy]]: Identifies particular <span class="hi-green">functional groups and bonds</span> in an organic sample.
- [[Mass spectrometry]]: Determines the relative atomic mass of an element, the relative molecular mass of a compound, and the structure of an unknown organic sample.

# Advantages
- More rapid
- More accurate, as instruments are more sensitive
- Usually non-destructive
- Lower possibility of human error

> [!tip] Problem with conventional analytical methods
> - A large amount of a sample is required to produce accurate results.
> - Chemical reactions usually occur in the sample, and cannot be recovered easily for reuse.
> - Results can be inaccurate due to human errors.
> 
> *Examples*: titrimetric analysis
