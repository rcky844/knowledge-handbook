**Mass spectrometry** is used to determine the <span class="hi-green">relative atomic mass of an element</span> and <span class="hi-green">relative molecular mass of a compound</span>, as well as the <span class="hi-orange">structure</span> of an unknown compound.

*Advantages*:
- Time for analysis is short.
- Very small amount of sample is needed.
- The sample can be in gaseous, liquid or solid states.
- High accuracy in determining molecular mass of compounds.

# Principles
![[mass_spectrometry.webp]]

1. **Vaporization**
	- The sample is first vaporized to <span class="hi-green">gaseous</span> form.
	- It can be an element or a compound.

2. **Ionization**
	- The gaseous sample is bombarded by a <span class="hi-green">beam of fast-moving electrons</span>.
	- Electrons from the molecules of the sample are knocked out, forming <span class="hi-orange">positive molecular ions</span> ($\ce{M+}$).
	  $$
	  \begin{array} \\
	  \ce{M(g) + \underset{fast}{e-} -> M+(g) + \underset{slow}{2e-}} \\
	  \text{e.g.}\,\,\,\ce{Na(g) + e- -> Na+(g) + 2e-}
	  \end{array}
	  $$
	- When molecular ions collide with electrons, they will undergo <span class="hi-blue">fragmentation</span>, producing <span class="hi-orange">fragment ions</span>.
	  $$
	  \begin{array}{l l} \\
	  \ce{CH4(g) + e- -> \underset{molecular ion}{CH4+(g)} + 2e-} \\\\
	  \ce{CH4+(g) -> \underset{fragment ion}{CH3+(g)} + \underset{radical}{.H(g)}} \\\\
	  \ce{CH3+(g) -> \underset{fragment ion}{CH2+(g)} + \underset{radical}{.H(g)}} \\\\
	  \ce{CH2+(g) -> \underset{fragment ion}{CH+(g)} + \underset{radical}{.H(g)}} \\\\
	  \ce{CH+(g) -> \underset{fragment ion}{C+(g)} + \underset{radical}{.H(g)}}
	  \end{array}
	  $$

3. **Acceleration**
	- The positive ions. including molecular ions and fragment ions, are <u>accelerated by an electric field towards a magnetic field</u>.

4. **Deflection**
	- The positive ions are deflected by a magnetic field.
	- Ions with lower mass-to-charge ratio (<span class="hi-blue">m/e or m/z</span>) are deflected more.
	- Ions with higher mass-to-charge ratio are deflected less.
	- By <span class="hi-green">varying the electric field and magnetic field</span>, ions of different m/e can enter the detector.

5. **Detection**
	- The detector produces electrical signals proportional to the number of ions detected.
	- The signals are recorded and presented in a <span class="hi-orange">mass spectrum</span>.

# Mass spectrum
A **mass spectrum** show the relative intensity (or relative abundance) of positive ions generated against the <u>mass-to-charge ratio of positive ions</u>.
