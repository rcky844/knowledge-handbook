*Pre-context: [[Crystallization]]*

**Recrystallization** is a process to <span style="color: lightgreen">purify impure solid products</span> prepared in chemical reactions.

#### Process
1. <span style="color: lightgreen">Choose a suitable solvent</span> that does not react with the solid product.
	- Water, ethanol, propanone (acetone) are commonly used solvents.

2. Dissolve the crude solid product in a minimum amount of hot solvent. Filter to remove the insoluble impurities.

3. Allow the hot filtrate to cool down to room temperature, the solute comes out as crystals.

4. Collect the crystals by filtration under reduced pressure and dry crystals.
	- Simple filtration can be sped up by connecting the set-up to a suction pump (suction filtration).

5. Wash the crystals with a little amount of cold distilled water or any other suitable solvents to remove any soluble impurities. Then, the crystals are dried with a piece of filter paper or in an oven.
