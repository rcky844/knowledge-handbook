**Liquid-liquid extraction**, also **solvent extraction**, is a process to extract substance from one liquid to another liquid. The liquids used must be <span style="color: lightgreen">immiscible</span>. A [[separating funnel]] is used for this extraction process.

#### Process
![[liquid_liquid_extraction.webp]]
Consider the extraction of iodine from <span style="color: orange">aqueous iodine solution</span> (brown in colour) in <span style="color: violet">heptane</span> (purple in colour):
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Iodine is more soluble in organic solvents</span> than in aqueous solvents.
- (a): Water and heptane is immiscible, they remain as two separate layers. 
- (b): After shaking, most of the iodine will dissolve into the heptane layer.
- Then, <span style="color: lightgreen">the tap is opened to run off</span> the lower aqueous layer and the top layer of iodine dissolved in heptane can be obtained.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Traces of water can be removed by adding drying agents</span> (e.g. anhydrous $\ce{Na2SO4}$, anhydrous $\ce{CaCl2}$) <span style="color: lightgreen">and then filtered.</span>
- The iodine dissolved in heptane can be further [[Fractional distillation|distilled]] to obtain iodine solid, as <u>heptane has a lower boiling point than iodine solid</u>.

> [!tip]
> In the above experiment, haptane is less dense than water and forms the <span style="color: violet">upper organic layer</span>, while water forms the <span style="color: violet">lower aqueous layer</span>. <u>However, students are not expected to deduce this.</u>

> [!warning]
> - <span style="color: lightgreen">The tap should be opened occasionally to remove vapour pressure</span>, otherwise the stopper may be pushed away.
> - <span style="color: lightgreen">The stopper should be removed before running off the liquid</span> from the separating funnel, otherwise the liquid may not run.
