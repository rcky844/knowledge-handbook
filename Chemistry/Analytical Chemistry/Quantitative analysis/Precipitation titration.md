# Mohr's method
**Mohr's method** is used to determine $\ce{[Cl-(aq)]}$ in a sample (e.g. soup, sea water) with <span style="color: violet">silver nitrate solution</span> ($\ce{AgNO3(aq)}$).

$$
\begin{array} \\
\ce{Ag+(aq) + Cl-(aq) -> AgCl(s)} \\
\ce{2Ag+(aq) + CrO4^2-(aq) <=> Ag2CrO4(s)}
\end{array}
$$
- When all the chloride ions in the sample has reacted, additional silver ions <span class="hi-green">react with chromate ions</span> from the indicator to form a <span style="color: aqua">reddish-brown precipitate</span>.
- <span class="hi-green">The end point is reached when reddish-brown precipitate forms.</span>

> [!tip] Acidification of reaction mixture
> If pH is too high (high $\ce{[OH-(aq)]}$), silver ions would react with hydroxide ions to form $\ce{Ag2O}$ precipitate.
> ↪️ $\ce{2Ag+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) -> Ag2O(s) + H2O(ℓ)}$
>
> If pH is too low (high $\ce{[H+(aq)]}$), chromate ions will turn to hydrogen chromate ions or dichromate ions.
> ↪️ $\ce{CrO4^2-(aq) + H+(aq) <=> HCrO4-(aq)}$
> ↪️ $\ce{2H+(aq) + 2CrO4^2-(aq) <=> Cr2O7^2-(aq) + H2O(ℓ)}$

# Volhard method
**Volhard method** is also used to determine $\ce{[Cl-(aq)]}$ in a sample, but with <span style="color: violet">ammonium thiocyanate</span> ($\ce{NH4SCN(aq)}$) and $\ce{Fe^3+(aq)}$ as indicator.

$$
\begin{array} \\
\ce{Ag+(aq) + Cl-(aq) -> AgCl(s)} \\
\ce{2Ag+(aq) + SCM-(aq) -> AgSCN(s)} \\
\ce{Fe^3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) -> FeSCN^2+(aq)}
\end{array}
$$
- Excess silver ions react with $\ce{SCN-(aq)}$ ions to form <span style="color: aqua">insoluble precipitate</span>.
- $\ce{Fe^3+(aq)}$ act as the indicator by reacting with excess $\ce{SCN-(aq)}$ to give a <span style="color: aqua">deep red solution</span>.
