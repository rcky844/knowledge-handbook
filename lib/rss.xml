<br>Air sacs are very numerous in number, providing a large surface area for diffusion of gases.
<br>The inner surfaces of the air sacs are covered with a moist water film with watery mucus. This allows oxygen to dissolve in it and diffuse across the alveolar wall more readily.
<br>The alveolar wall is one-cell thick and composed of only one layer of epithelial cell, providing a short distance for diffusion of gases.
<br>Air sacs are surrounded by a dense network of blood capillaries, providing a rich blood supply to readily transport gases between the blood and the air sacs and maintain a steep concentration gradient of gases.
<br>The alveolar wall lie close to the blood capillaries, reducing the diffusion distance for diffusion of gases between the blood and the air sacs.
<br>Tip
The outer walls of air sacs contain elastic protein fibres, which makes the air sacs elastic, allowing them to expand and shrink.<br>
Once the intercostal and diaphragm muscles relax, the air sacs shrinks (recoils) and return to their original size. This allows exhalation to occur even without muscles contractions of the lungs or air sacs themselves.
<br><br><br>Patients with lung inflammation may have fluid accumulated in the air sacs.<br>
<br>It increases the distance for diffusion of gases.
<br>It reduces the surface area of the water film for dissolving gases.
<br><br>When dusty air is breathed in, the mechanisms to filter out the dust may be overwhelmed, allowing dust to deposit on the surfaces of the air sacs.<br>
<br>It forms a barrier and increases the diffusion distance.
<br>Significant portions of the inner surface of the air sacs can be blocked by dust, reducing the surface area for diffusion of gases.
<br>Hardened layer of dust can reduce the elasticity of lungs, and reduces the volume of the lungs when it inflates.

<br>The lungs contain no muscles, and cannot expand or contract on their own.<br>
Breathing is brought about by the movements of intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a dome-shaped sheet of muscles below the lungs that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity.<br>
<br>
<br>The lungs are surrounded and protected by the rib cage.<br>
The <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Human skeleton > Rib cage" data-href="Human skeleton#Rib cage" href="biology/neuroscience/coordination/movement-in-humans/human-skeleton.html#Rib_cage" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">rib cage</a> is formed by 12 pairs of ribs, the sternum and the vertebral column, with the intercostal muscles lying between them.
<br>Tip
The lung is an elastic structure that tends to decrease its size at all volumes. If there is a leakage of air, the lungs would collapse.
<br><br><img alt="lungs_protection2.avif" src="lib/media/lungs_protection2.avif" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Pleural membranes:<br>
<br>Each lung is enclosed by two pleural membranes. The inner membrane is attached to the lungs, while the outer membrane lines the thoracic cavity.
<br>They form a narrow space between the two membranes called the pleural cavity, which always maintain a negative pressure.
<br>They secrete pleural fluid into the cavity to reduce friction between the lungs and the rib cage during breathing movements.

Deamination<br>

<br>
Production of bile<br>
Produces bile from breaking down red blood cells to help speed up the digestion of lipids.

<br>
Storage of glycogen, iron and fat-soluble vitamins

<br>Store excess carbohydrates as glycogen as 'short-term' energy reserve.
<br>Store iron from broken down old red blood cells and can be used to make new red blood cells.
<br>Store fat-soluble vitamins (e.g. vitamins A and D) and carotene (can be converted to vitamin A).


<br>
Detoxification<br>
Converts certain toxic substances (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, drugs) in the blood into harmless substances. Wastes formed are excreted in urine or bile.

 <br><br>Saliva is a digestive juice produced by salivary glands in the mouth.<br>
<br>It mixes with food during <a data-href="ingestion" href="biology/anatomy/nutrition/digestion-&amp;-absorption/ingestion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ingestion</a> as food is cut into smaller pieces by teeth, and they are rolled into a mass called bolus by the tongue.
<br>Composition:<br>
<br>Water: Moistens and softens food (99.5% of saliva is water)
<br>Salivary amylase: Catalyses the breakdown of starch into maltose
<br>Mineral salts: Maintains a slightly alkaline pH (~7.5) for the optimum action of salivary amylase
<br>Mucus: Sticks food pieces together and lubricates the food to make it easier to swallow
<br><br>The bolus is swallowed through the pharynx into oesophagus by a series of actions that ensures the food enters the oesophagus but not the trachea or nasal cavity.<br>Series of actions:<br>
<br>Tongue rises to force the bolus to the back of the mouth cavity.
<br>Soft palate is pushed upward to close the nasal cavity at the back.
<br>Larynx moves upward and forward. Epiglottis covers the entrance to the trachea, preventing the bolus from entering the trachea.
<br>The beginning of the swallowing process is voluntary. It becomes an automatic reflex action once the bolus reaches the back of the mouth.<br><br>Peristalsis is a physical digestion process where waves of alternative muscle contractions that push the bolus along the entire canal and helps mix food with digestive juices to speed up digestion.<br><img alt="peristalsis1.avif" src="lib/media/peristalsis1.avif" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>

The result is a watery emulsion called chyle.<br><br>Contents:<br>

<br>Increases the surface area of lipids for the action of the enzyme lipase.


<br>Sodium hydrogencarbonate: Makes the bile alkaline

<br>&lt;span class="hi-green"Neutralizes the acidic chyme from the stomach.
<br>Provides alkaline pH (7.6 ~ 8.6) for intestine enzymes.


<br>Bile pigments: Green, break down products of haemoglobin from red blood cells
<br>Warning

<br>The bile contains no digestive enzymes.
<br>Emulsification of lipids is caused by bile salts, and is a physical process.

<br>Secretion:<br>
<br>After bile is produced in the liver, it is temporarily stored in the gall bladder.
<br>When fatty food is present in the duodenum, the gall bladder contracts to release a large quantity of it into the duodenum.
<br>Tip
When the gall bladder is removed surgically, bile flows directly into the duodenum, small amounts of bile may not be sufficient for effective digestion of lipids. This may result in malabsorption and fatty faeces (steatorrhea).
<br><br>Contents:<br>
<br>Sodium hydrogencarbonate
<br>Pancreatic amylase: Catalyses the breakdown of starch in chyme into maltose
<br>Lipase: Catalyses the breakdown of lipids into fatty acids and glycogen
<br>Proteases: Catalyses the breakdown of proteins into peptides and amino acids
<br><br>Contents:<br>
<br>Water, mucus, sodium hydrogencarbonate
<br>Carbohydrase: Catalyses the breakdown of disaccharides into monosaccharides
<br>Proteases: Catalyses the breakdown of peptides into amino acids
<br>Secretion:<br>
<img alt="intestinal_juice_secretion.avif" src="lib/media/intestinal_juice_secretion.avif" style="width: 180px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>Present on the cell membrane of the epithelial cells of duodenum and the first part of the ileum.
<br>Secreted by glands in the wall of the small intestine.
<br><br><br>The small intestine is also responsible for most of the absorption process. It absorbs the most amount of water, monosaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol.<br><br>
<br>
The small intestine is very long.<br>
This allows sufficient time for the complete digestion and absorption of food as it passed along the small intestine.

<br>
There are many projections on intestinal wall and surface of epithelial cells.

<br>Finger-like projections called villi are present on intestinal walls. They are formed by the higher folded inner surface of the small intestine.
<br>Numerous projections (microvilli) also exists on the surface of epithelial cells of the villi.
<br>They increases the surface area for absorption.


<br><br>
<br>
Epithelium of each villus is one-cell thick.<br>
This shortens the distance for transport of food molecules.

<br>
Epithelium cells of each villi contains many mitochondria.<br>
This provides energy for the <a data-href="active transport" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/active-transport.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">active transport</a> of certain food molecules.

<br>
Each villus has a lymph vessel called lacteal, which is surrounded by a dense network of blood capillaries.

<br>The lacteal carries away lipids, while blood capillaries carry away sugars and amino acids.
<br>This maintains a steep concentration gradient for rapid absorption.


<br>
Villi are in constant motion due to peristalsis of the muscular wall.<br>
This brings the digested food molecules into close contact with villi and reduces the distance for diffusion for rapid absorption.

<br><br>Into the blood:<br>
<br>Small, water-soluble molecules (e.g. monosaccharides, amino acids, minerals and certain vitamins) are absorbed through the epithelium of villi into blood capillaries by <a data-href="diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusion</a> and <a data-href="active transport" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/active-transport.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">active transport</a>.
<br>Absorption of digested food into the blood decreases the water potential of the blood., resulting in 80% of the water from chyme being absorbed in the small intestine into the blood by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a>.
<br>Into the lymph: Diffusion<br>
<br>Fatty acids and glycerol first pass into the epithelial cells of villi.
<br>They are then recombined inside the cells to form small oil droplets, and then passed out of the cell to enter the lacteal.
<br>Oil droplets are then carried by the lymph in the lymphatic system and eventually enter the bloodstream.

<br>Cardiac sphincter is a circular sphincter muscle located at the entrance of the stomach to control the entry of food and prevent food from flowing back up the oesophagus.
<br>Pyloric sphincter is a circular sphincter muscle located at the exit of the stomach to control the exit of food to the duodenum.
<br><br>Features:<br>
<br>It is folded and elastic. The folds can spread out to increase the volume of the stomach when it fills with food.
<br>Secretions:<br>
<br>Gastric glands in the inner wall secretes gastric juice.
<br>Secretes mucus which covers its inner surface, forming a physical barrier to prevent the acid and digestive enzymes from damaging itself.
<br>Composition of gastric juice:<br>
<br>Enzyme pepsin, a type of protease that catalyses the breakdown of proteins into peptides.
<br>Hydrochloric acid.

<br>Provides an acidic medium (pH ~2) for proteases to work optimally.
<br>Denatures proteins in foods by unfolding the three-dimensional shapes of protein molecules, making it easier to digest.
<br>Kills most of the bacteria taken in with food.


<br><br>Churning are rhythmic contractions of the stomach wall stimulated by the arrival of the bolus.<br>
<br>The bolus is churned and mixed with gastric juice.
<br>Results in a semi-liquid paste of partially digested food called chyme.
<br>A small amount of chyme is released into the duodenum through the pyloric sphincter at a time.

<br>Lumen: Relatively small
<br>Valves: Absent (except at the base of pulmonary artery and aorta)
<br>Rate of blood flow: Faster
<br><br>
<br>Arteries have very thick walls to withstand the high pressure of the blood.
<br>The walls of the arteries contain large number of elastic fibres that stretches and recoils when the heart contracts and relaxes respectively. This helps maintain blood pressure and continuous blood flow.
<br>The walls of arteries have a thick muscle layer, which regulate blood flow to certain organs or tissues by contracting or relaxing to change the diameter of the vessels to .

(blood has overcome resistance from the walls of blood vessels after travelling through many vessels over a long distance)
<br>Oxygenation of blood: Deoxygenated<br>
(except pulmonary vein and umbilical vein of an unborn baby)
<br>Location: Most are located closer to the body surface (for heat dissipation)
<br>Wall: Thinner wall with fewer elastic fibres
<br>Lumen: Relatively large
<br>Valves: Present
<br>Rate of blood flow: Slower
<br>Force to move the blood:<br>
<br>Contraction of skeletal muscles adjacent to the veins aids blood flow. When these skeletal muscles contract, the veins are squeezed and the blood inside is forced towards the heart.
<br>Inhalation creates negative pressure in the thoracic cavity that facilitates the flow of blood in veins back to the heart.
<br><br>
<br>Veins have a larger lumen than arteries, which reduces resistance so that blood can continue to flow in the veins at low pressure.
<br>Valves are present to prevent the backflow of blood to ensure that blood flows in one direction only (towards the heart).
<br><br><img alt="capillaries.webp" src="lib/media/capillaries.webp" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>
<br>Direction of blood flow: Connect arteries and veins
<br>Blood pressure: Falls when the blood travels from arterial end to venous end
<br>Oxygenation of blood: Oxygenated at arterial end, deoxygenated at venous end
<br>Location: In body tissues (for exchange of materials between blood and body cells, forms networks called capillary beds)
<br>Wall: One-cell thick
<br>Lumen: Very small
<br>Valves: Absent
<br>Rate of blood flow: Very slow
<br><br>
<br>The capillaries are highly branched to reduce resistance so that blood can continue to flow in the veins at low pressure.
<br>The capillaries are very close to tissue cells to prevent the backflow of blood, ensuring that blood flows in one direction only (towards the heart).
<br>The capillary network has a very large cross-sectional area so that blood flows slowly, which allows more time for the exchange of materials.
<br>The capillary wall is one-cell thick to provide a short diffusion distance for the exchange of materials.
<br>The lumen size of capillaries is very small, which brings red blood cells in close contact with the capillary wall, which reduces the distance for oxygen to diffuse from red blood cells to the body tissues.
<br>The capillary wall is differentially permeable, allowing small and soluble substances to be exchanged, while retaining large molecules (e.g. plasma protein) in the blood.

<br>Pulmonary circulation: Connects the heart and the lungs
<br>Systemic circulation: Connects the heart and all parts of the body<br>
(except the lungs)
<br>Advantages:<br>
<br>
Separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood<br>
The pulmonary circulation is separated from the systemic circulation so that only oxygenated blood is carried to the body tissues.

<br>
Blood pressures of each circulation can be kept different<br>
(compared to single circulation)

<br>Strong contractions of the left ventricle create high blood pressure to move blood quickly through the systemic circulation to all parts of the body.

<br>Tissue fluid is formed from blood in a capillary bed.
<br>The hydrostatic pressure of the blood is higher than the tissue fluid at the arterial end of the capillary bed.
<br>Some components of the plasma are forced out through the differentially permeable capillary walls to become tissue fluid.
<br>Composition:<br>
<br>Tissue fluid contains water, mineral, glucose, amino acids, lipids and hormones.
<br>Tissue fluid does not contain plasma proteins, red blood cells and blood platelets as they are too large to pass through the walls of capillaries.

Red blood cells are packed with haemoglobin.<br>
Haemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that can bind with oxygen to serve as an oxygen carrier.

Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus.<br>
This enables them to hold more haemoglobin and thus carry more oxygen.

 <br>Cloning of organisms is the production of genetically identical individuals.<br><br>Tissue culture, or micropropagation, is a technique commonly used for plant cloning.<br>Process:<br>
<br>Tissue samples are taken from a surface sterilized parent plant.
<br>The sample is placed in a sterilized culture medium to allow the formation of callus by <a data-href="mitotic cell division" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/cell-cycle-&amp;-division/mitotic-cell-division.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mitotic cell division</a>.
<br>Small pieces of the callus are transferred to different sterile culture media to promote growth of shoots and roots.
<br>The plantlets formed are planted into soil, which grows into a whole plant genetically identical to the parent plant.
<br><br><br>Embryo spliting involves the isolation of individual cells from an embryo at an early stage and growing them independently, with each isolated cell developing into an embryo.<br>Eventually, the embryos are transferred into the uteri of surrogate mothers for further development.<br><br>Process:<br>
<br>A somatic cell (e.g. mammary gland cell) is obtained from an animal (nucleus donor).
<br>An egg cell is obtained from another sheep (egg donor), and its nucleus is removed.
<br>The somatic cell is fused with the egg cell (lacks a nucleus). The fused cell develops into an embryo.
<br>The embryos are then transferred into the uteri of surrogate mother.
<br>The surrogate mother gives birth to the cloned animal.
<br><br>Cloning in general:<br>
<br>Desirable characteristics of the parent can be preserved, as clones are genetically identical to the parent.
<br>Cloning is difficult or slow to breed quickly.
<br>Endangered species and organisms with considerable economic importance can be propagated quickly.
<br>GM plants or animals can be used to produce pharmaceutical products or other useful chemicals.
<br>Plant cloning:<br>
<br>Cloned plants free of pathogens can be produced, as they are grown under sterile conditions.
<br>Plant cloning requires relatively little space compared to growing plants in the field.
<br>Animal cloning:<br>
<br>Cloned animals can serve as models for studying diseases and testing drugs.
<br>Cloning early embryos provide stem cells for research or medical treatment.
<br><br>Plant cloning:<br>
<br>The cost of tissue culture may be higher than conventional methods as it requires sterile conditions and is labour-intensive.
<br>Cloned population may be less able to adapt to environmental changes due to lack of genetic variations.
<br>Animal cloning:<br>
<br>Animal cloning with nuclear transfer has low success rate, but high costs.
<br>Animal clones may age faster and have a shorter lifespan.

 <br>Gene therapy can be used to introduce genetic materials into cells to treat genetic diseases involving defective gene.<br>
<br>It involves the use of vectors such as inactivated viruses, which infects and transfers the normal gene into the target cell.
<br>The normal gene is expressed and directs protein synthesis to produce the functional proteins.
<br>Note
This section focuses mainly on somatic cell gene therapy, where the genetic material of their germ cells (gametes) is not changed. The changes in gene is not inheritable.
<br><br>Criteria:<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Nature of stem cells" data-href="Nature of stem cells" href="biology/biotechnology/applications/nature-of-stem-cells.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Stem cells</a> should be selected, as they are capable of producing cells continuously.
<br>Only cells that can express the correct version of the gene to produce the correct products are selected.
<br><br>Benefits:<br>
<br>Various genetic diseases can be treated.
<br>Progressive diseases can be prevented.
<br>Transformation can occur outside of patient's body, no immune response is triggered.
<br>Only successfully transformed cells are returned to the patient's body, the results are highly effective.
<br>Gene used comes from humans only, and does not break the normal species barrier nature has set.
<br>The trait is not heritable and will not change the genetic composition permanently.
<br>Does not upset the ecological balance (unlike <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Transgenic organisms" data-href="Transgenic organisms" href="biology/biotechnology/applications/transgenic-organisms.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">transgenic animals</a>).
<br>Hazards:<br>
<br>It is possible to develop viral diseases, even if viral vectors are made harmless.
<br>Viral vectors may trigger severe immune responses in some patients.
<br>New genes may be wrongly delivered to non-target cells, or inappropriately expressed (e.g. making products in excessive amounts or at wrong times).
<br>New genes are inserted at random locations in the genome and may affect the expression of an existing gene.
<br>The transformed cells may die, and the body can no longer synthesize the gene products, allowing the disease to reappear.

Human embryos are destroyed when isolating embryonic stem cells.

<br>
Safety concerns

<br>Cells in organ or tissue transplants can be recognized as foreign by recipient's immune system and rejected.
<br>Transplanted stem cells may proliferate uncontrollably and becomes cancerous, or differentiate into undesired cells in the patient.


<br>
Difficulty of usage

<br>Body tissues contain only a small number of adult stem cells, and they are difficult to isolate and culture.
<br>Stem cells are difficult to grow and induce differentiation.


<br>Advantages of using adult stem cells

<br>Adult stem cells are derived from the patient itself, and does not harm the patient.
<br>Transplanted will not be rejected by the patient's own immune system.

 <br><br>Benefits of production with GMOs:<br>
<br>
Higher product yield<br>
GMOs typically have a higher growth rate, product yield from GMOs is much higher than animal sources, which takes a long time to rear.

<br>
More pure &amp; lower risk of infection<br>
The process of purification is much easier from GMOs than animal sources, whereas products extracted from animal sources are easily contaminated by pathogens.

<br>
Continuous production<br>
Production occurs continuously from bacterial culture, whereas animals provide only a limited amount of products.

<br>
Less side effects<br>
Products with amino acid sequences highly similar to human counterparts can be produced, so it would not be rejected by the body as immune responses would not be triggered that degrade its functions.

<br>↪️ Overall effect: Lower cost of production<br>Example: HKDSE 2013 Paper 2 Q4(a)<br><br><br>
Refer to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Recombinant DNA technology > Production of human insulin" data-href="Recombinant DNA technology#Production of human insulin" href="biology/biotechnology/techniques/recombinant-dna-technology.html#Production_of_human_insulin" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">this section</a> for production process.
<br>Background:<br>
<br>Diabetic (type I) patients were treated with insulin extracted from animals (e.g. pigs, cattle).
<br>Problems:<br>
<br>Easily contaminated by pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses)
<br>Has an amino acid sequence slightly different from human insulin, may trigger immune response and cause side effects.
<br>Solution: Recombinant human insulin<br>
<br>Produced by genetically modified bacteria.
<br>Has the same amino acid sequences as natural human insulin.
<br>Does not trigger immune responses in the human body and has fewer side effects.
<br><br>Background:<br>
<br>Caused by pituitary gland disorders, people affected has slow growth rate, with shorter height than other individuals.
<br>Treated by injections of growth hormone extracted from dead bodies.
<br>Problems:<br>
<br>Supply for extracted HGH is limited.
<br>Extracts might have been contaminated with pathogens.
<br>Solution: Recombinant HGH<br>
<br>Produced by genetically modified bacteria.
<br>Produced in larger quantities and in a purer form.

<br>Vaccines for viruses may become pathogenic again.
<br>Solution #1: Recombinant protein vaccines<br>
<br>Produced by GM microorganisms.
<br>Free of whole pathogens and safer.
<br>Can be produced in large quantities.
<br>Solution #2: Transgenic plants<br>
<br>Antigens are produced in the edible parts of the plants, which will be absorbed into the blood through the alimentary canal.
<br>Antigens will stimulate the body to produce a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Primary and secondary response > Primary response" data-href="Primary and secondary response#Primary response" href="biology/immunology/body-defence-mechanisms/specific-defence/responses/primary-and-secondary-response.html#Primary_response" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">primary response</a> to produce memory cells.

<br>The desired protein molecules will bind to the antibodies on the beads, while other molecules will flow through.
<br><br>
<br>A pregnancy test strip contains monoclonal antibodies specific for HCG.
<br>When the test strip is dipped into a urine sample of a pregnant women, the HCG present binds to the monoclonal antibodies, resulting in a colour change of the strip that indicates pregnancy.
<br><br>
<br>Rapid antigen test: Monoclonal antibodies can recognize and specifically bind to antigens on pathogens or cancer cells for diagnostic tests.
<br>Treatment of cancer: Monoclonal antibodies recognize and attach to cancer cells, 'making' them for the immune system to destroy them.
<br><br><br>Plasmids extracted from bacteria are usually used as vectors for transferring a gene of interest into host cells.<br>Advantages:<br>
<br>Plasmids are small in size. They are readily taken up by bacteria cells and transferred naturally between bacteria.
<br>Plasmids can serve as marker to allow the selection of transformed bacteria, as they usually carry antibiotic resistance genes.
<br>Plasmids replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome, and multiple copies of the gene of interest can exist in a single bacterial cell.
<br><br>Bacteria are commonly used as host cells in <a data-href="Recombinant DNA technology" href="biology/biotechnology/techniques/recombinant-dna-technology.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Recombinant DNA technology</a>.<br>Advantages:<br>

 <br>Transgenic organisms are <a data-href="genetically modified organisms" href="biology/biotechnology/techniques/genetically-modified-organisms.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">genetically modified organisms</a> used in scientific research, agriculture and the food industry.<br><br>
<br>
Studying the functions of genes<br>
Genes can be introduced or inactivated for comparing the characteristics or metabolism of transgenic and non-transgenic organisms.

<br>
Studying diseases<br>
Transgenic organisms can be used as models to study mechanisms of diseases and test possible treatments.<br>
Example: Oncogenes can be introduced into genomes of mice to develop cancer.

<br>
Safety testing<br>
Transgenic organisms are made more sensitive to certain chemicals and exposed to new products (e.g. cosmetics) to evaluate the safety of the products by examining their physiological responses.

<br><br>Transgenic crops are genetically modified to improve yield, shelf life and nutritional value, so as to provide more affordable food to more people.<br><br>
<br>
Herbicide resistance<br>
Farmers can use herbicide to kill weeds competing with crops (water, nutrients, sunlight, space), while not killing the crops themselves.

<br>
Pest resistance<br>
Crops are engineered to synthesize Bt toxins (a toxic protein that kills the larvae of certain insects) in all cells to reduce the amount of chemical pesticides required.

<br>
Disease resistance<br>
Example: Tobacco mosaic virus; causes pale mottling on leaves of infected plants

<br>
Cold, drought and salt tolerance<br>
Crops can be grown in places with relatively cool climates, or poor soil quality (e.g. high salt concentration or waterlogging).

<br><br>
<br>
Enhanced nutritional value<br>
Example: Omega-3 fatty acids; helps prevent cardiovascular diseases<br>
Example: -carotene (Golden Rice); precursor of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vitamins > Vitamin A" data-href="Vitamins#Vitamin A" href="biology/anatomy/nutrition/theory-of-nutrition/vitamins.html#Vitamin_A" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vitamin A</a>

<br>
Longer shelf life

<br>Ripening of fruits can be controlled, reducing loss of fruits and food wastage from early ripening and softening before reaching consumers.
<br>They can be stored for a longer time under controlled conditions, and can be transported to more distant markets.


<br><br><br>
<br>
Faster growth<br>
Example: Transgenic salmon

<br>Increased productivity; grows twice as fast as non-transgenic ones
<br>Lowers unit costs
<br>Reduces overfishing of wild salmon


<br>
Tolerance to cold climate<br>
Warm water species are genetically engineered to produce antifreeze proteins, which keep them active even in freezing environments, so they can be farmed in cold waters.

<br>
Disease resistance<br>
Diary cows have a gene coding for an antibacterial protein inserted to kill the bacteria that cause mastitis (decreases volume and quality of milk produced).

<br><br>
<br>Transgenic cows are genetically modified to produce milk that contains some proteins found in human breast milk, providing a better alternative for mothers who cannot breastfeed their babies.
<br>Some transgenic cows are genetically produced milk with higher level of casein, which shortens the time required for coagulation of curds in cheese making.
<br>Transgenic cows and pigs have been developed with a gene that increases the content of omega-3 fatty acids.
<br><br>Transgenic pigs are made to be able to digest and absorb phosphate more efficiently to significantly reduce the phosphate content in their manure.<br>If their manure washed into a river, it would not contaminate the water and cause excessive growth of algae (algal bloom).]]></description><link>biology/biotechnology/applications/transgenic-organisms.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Biology/Biotechnology/Applications/Transgenic organisms.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:32:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Benefits]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>
<br>Providing scientists with new tools to study organisms at the molecule level. (e.g. particular gene can be knocked out to study its effect on organisms)
<br>Speeding up research in medical science and bringing advances in medicine. (e.g. genetic diseases)
<br>Opening up new possibilities for solving food shortages and providing ways to improve food quality. (e.g. GM crop plants)
<br>Enabling development of new tools for cleaning up contaminated environment. (e.g. break down hydrocarbons in oil spills)
<br><br>
<br>The use of antibiotic resistance genes as selection markers raises concerns in creating multi-antibiotic-resistant bacteria (‘superbugs’).
<br>GM foods and recombinant drugs may cause allergic reactions and their long-term effects on our health are still unknown.
<br>GMOs (leaked outside laboratories or test fields) may breed with wild types and transfer their modified genes to the offspring. GMOs may out-compete wild types and upset the ecological balance.

 <br>DNA fingerprinting, also DNA profiling, is a technique used for identifying individuals using their DNA profiles.<br><br><br>Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) are located at non-coding regions of chromosomes with has large amounts of mutations.<br>The phenomenon of length polymorphism can be exploited as:<br>
<br>Each VNTR contains a variable number of short repetitive sequences of nucleotides, which varies greatly among individuals. This results in different lengths of VNTRs when cut with restriction enzymes.
<br>Each individual receive two allele from each parent, with low chance of two persons having the same set of VNTRs (except for identical twins) due to <a data-href="independent assortment" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/cell-cycle-&amp;-division/independent-assortment.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">independent assortment</a>, <a data-href="crossing over" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/cell-cycle-&amp;-division/crossing-over.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">crossing over</a> or random fertilization.
<br><img alt="vntr.webp" src="lib/media/vntr.webp"><br>Note
The VNTR segments with varying lengths can be extracted with restriction enzymes.

<br>These segments can be separated by gel electrophoresis.
<br>The method of generating a DNA fingerprint is called restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP analysis).

<br><br>Gel electrophoresis is a method for separating DNA fragments based on their size.<br><img alt="gel_electrophoresis.webp" src="lib/media/gel_electrophoresis.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Design:<br>
<br>Negatively charged DNA are placed at the negative end (cathode) of the gel, they will migrate towards the positive end (anode).
<br>Smaller fragments (with shorter lengths) move (through the pores of the gel) faster and further than larger ones in a given time.<br>
Separate bands are formed on the gel.
<br>The DNA is stained with a dye or labeled with a radioactive marker as it is colourless.
<br><br>RFLP (Restriction fragment length polymorphism) is a technique that can pinpoint the locations of genes.<br>Process:<br>
<br>Extract DNA sample (e.g. hair, blood, saliva, semen) from the individuals.
<br>Suitability of samples

<br>The sample needs to contain nucleated cells (e.g. hair follicle stem cells, white blood cells, cheek cells).
<br>For semen, although one sperm cell only contains one set of chromosomes, there are many sperm cells in semen, each receiving chromosomes randomly in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Meiotic cell division" data-href="Meiotic cell division" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/cell-cycle-&amp;-division/meiotic-cell-division.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">meiosis</a> from diploid daughter cells. When lyzed, its lysate would contain both sets of chromosomes in diploid daughter cells.

<br>
<br>
Use restriction enzymes to cut (digest) the DNA sample into segments.

<br>A large amount of DNA fragments is produced, some containing VNTRs.


<br>
Separate DNA fragments using gel electrophoresis.

<br>The DNA fragments are separated according to their molecular size.


<br>
The gel is immersed in an alkaline solution so that DNA fragments are denatured and becomes single-stranded. They are transferred from the gel to a nylon membrane.

<br>
The nylon membrane is incubated with radioactive DNA probes (single-stranded DNA fragments). The DNA probes bind to complementary bases of the VNTRs.

<br>
Unbound DNA probes are washed off. An X-ray film is placed against the nylon membrane in the dark. Radioactive probes on the DNA fragments expose the film and give a pattern of dark bands, making up the DNA fingerprint.

<br>
Match the DNA fingerprint patterns between individuals.

<br>Positive matching can be used as evidence against the suspect / proof for biological relationships as the DNA of an individual is unique.


<br>Warning
When a sample involves two alleles, the total number of bands formed may need to be multiplied by two.
<br>Shortcomings:<br>
<br>Time-consuming, require several weeks to complete
<br>Require relatively large amounts of DNA
<br>Alternatives to RFLP analysis
Short tandem repeats (STR) are shorter (in length) repetitive sequences of nucleotides. Specific loci are chosen for analysis, less time is required for analysis.
<br><br>
<br>
Criminal investigation<br>
Hair, saliva, blood or semen sample in the crime scene is collected to create DNA fingerprints for matching with those of victims and suspects.

<br>
Percentage testing<br>
Each child inherits half of the genetic material from each parent, so some bands of the DNA fingerprint of the child will resemble some bands of the mother and father respectively. Individuals can be tested for any biological relationship.

<br>Note
DNA fingerprints of a pair of identical twins show the same band patterns, so it can be used to determine whether both twins are identical or fraternal.<br>

<br>
<br>
Victim identification<br>
DNA fingerprinting can be used to identify the remains of victims in natural disasters, especially when the body is badly decomposed or if only parts of the body is found. DNA samples recovered from personal items are used for comparison.

<br>
Medical diagnosis of diseases<br>
DNA fingerprinting can be used to check whether an individual carries a mutant allele for a genetic disease in order to diagnose genetic diseases in fetuses and newborn babies.

<br>
Authentication of food products and herbal medicines<br>
DNA fingerprinting is more accurate method of determining the authenticity (genuine vs substitutes) of an uncooked food sample, and replaces the traditional morphological comparison.<br>
Examples: GM foods, caviar, Korean ginseng

<br>
Ecological studies and conservation

<br>DNA fingerprint of an unknown species is compared with known species to identify it.
<br>Genetic variations of a particular species can be monitored.
<br>Goods can be identified to check whether they are made from body parts of protected species.


<br>
Evolutionary studies<br>
DNA fingerprinting helps establish evolutionary relationships among different groups of organisms.

<br>Primers of suitable length (about 18 - 24 bases) should be used.

<br>Shorter primers have fewer combinations of base sequences and less variations, there is a higher chance for it to anneal to wrong positions of the DNA strand and produce inaccurate, non-specific DNA amplification product.
<br>Longer primers result in slower annealing rate.


<br>The nucleotide sequence of primers should point in the direction (3' or 5') which DNA extension occurs.
<br>Two different primers (pointing toward one another) are needed, as a DNA template consists of two strands.
<br>Length of primers

<br>Shorter primers are used to amplify a small, simple fragment of DNA.
<br>Longer primers are used to amplify an eukaryotic genomic DNA sample.

<br>Warning

<br>Primers are DNA molecules, so it should not contain the base uracil (U).

<br>Functions:<br>
<br>They bind to one end of the target sequence to mark the point where the synthesis of a new DNA strand starts.
<br>The target sequence to be amplified is 'bracketed'.
<br><br>Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are free nucleotides and building blocks of new DNA strands.<br><br>DNA polymerase are enzymes that joins adjacent free complementary nucleotides.<br>
<br>The enzyme needs to be able to withstand the high temperature (heat stable) during PCR with high enzymatic activity.

<br>
Denaturation<br>
Heat the reaction mixture (to about 95°C) to denature the DNA molecules so that the double helix unwind and separate into two single strands.

<br>
Primer annealing<br>
Cool the reaction mixture (to between 50°C and 65°C) to allow primers with complementary bases to anneal to each end of the single-stranded DNA molecules.

<br><br>Producing recombinant DNA:<br>
<br>
Isolation of gene of interest and vectors

<br>DNA fragments containing the gene of interest are isolated from donor cells.
<br>Vectors (plasmids) are isolated from bacteria.


<br>
Restriction (cutting of DNA fragments and plasmids)

<br>Restriction enzymes recognize and cut at specific base sequences (restriction sites) on a piece of DNA.
<br>The same restriction enzyme is used to cut open the plasmids, so the same sticky ends are produced to allow them to be ligated together.
<br>Different types of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sticky and blunt ends" data-href="Sticky and blunt ends" href="biology/biotechnology/techniques/sticky-and-blunt-ends.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ends of a DNA fragment</a> are produced.


<br>Note
Restriction enzymes are produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against bacteriophages by cutting up viral DNA before it can be integrated into the bacteria chromosome and replicates.
<br>
<br>Ligation (joining of DNA fragments and plasmids)

<br>Gene of interest is inserted into an open plasmid, and joined together with the help of DNA ligase.
<br>Resulting DNA molecule is called a recombinant plasmid.


<br>Transforming bacteria:<br>
<br>Introduce recombinant plasmids into bacterial cells
<br>Select the transformed bacteria by culturing the bacteria on nutrient agar containing a specific antibiotic.

<br>Some bacteria may not become transformed when they do not take up recombinant plasmids.
<br>The insertion of target gene into a plasmid is a random process, some plasmids (with smaller size) may re-join without taking up the target gene.
<br>Only the transformed bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic, so they survive and reproduce to form colonies.


<br>Production of proteins:<br>
<br>Induce the expression of the gene to encode the protein product.
<br>Extract and purify the proteins produced.

 <br>Bioethics focuses on ethical issues and other concerns cased by advanced in biological sciences and medicine.<br><br>Areas of concern:<br>
<br>Ethical issues: Moral values, human rights, animal rights, religious beliefs
<br>Health issues: Potential hazards to human health
<br>Legal issues: Government's policy making, law making and enforcement
<br>Social issues: Effects on society, equality and fairness
<br>Economic issues: Costs of research and development, application of biotechnology
<br>Environmental issues: Effects of biotechnology on environment, biodiversity, ecological balance
<br>Factors for consideration:<br>
<br>Risks associated with the technology
<br>Unintended consequences
<br>Benefits of the technology
<br>Ways to actively minimize risks
<br>Whether the new technology should be used
<br><br>See also: <a data-href="Genetically modified organisms" href="biology/biotechnology/techniques/genetically-modified-organisms.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genetically modified organisms</a><br>Ethical issues:<br>
<br>Creating GMOs may violate the laws of nature, and some religions are against GMOs as they believe humans should not play the role of God.
<br>Some people are concerned about sources of foreign genes in GM foods.<br>
Example: Vegetarians may not accept vegetables containing animal genes.
<br>GM animals may suffer poor health and reduced lifespan, raising concerns about animal welfare.
<br>Health issues:<br>
<br>GM foods may cause unknown long-term health effects (e.g. allergic reactions)
<br>Antibiotic resistance genes in GM foods may transfer to bacteria in human intestines, producing <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Antibiotics > Development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria" data-href="Antibiotics#Development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria" href="biology/immunology/health-and-diseases/infectious-diseases/antibiotics.html#Development_of_antibiotic_resistance_in_bacteria" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">antibiotic-resistant 'superbugs'</a> and causing incurable diseases. (low chance)
<br>Social and economic issues:<br>
<br>GM crops have higher yields with lower production costs than non-GM crops. This reduces the competitiveness of farmers who grow non-GM crops and affects their livelihood.
<br>Poorer farmers may not be able to afford expensive GM seeds (due to patents) while wealthier ones can. This may widen the wealth gap between developing and developed countries.
<br>GM crops may be genetically modified to grow for only one season and afterwards produce sterile seeds that do not germinate. Farmers would be forced to buy new seeds from the manufacturer every year, so farmers may benefit little from growing GM crops.
<br>Environmental issues:<br>
<br>GMOs may out-compete wild types and replace them, leading to a decrease in biodiversity and may upset the ecological balance.
<br>When GMOs are grown in open areas, pollen grains from the GM crops may pollinate non-GM crops, causing genetic pollution.
<br>There is a risk of gene transfer from GM crops to weeds, resulting in 'superweeds' which may spread uncontrollably.
<br>Toxins produced by pest-resistant crops may accumulate along the food chain and cause poisoning in consumers at higher trophic levels.
<br>Mass farming of pest-resistant crops may speed up the evolution of pesticide resistance in insect populations.
<br><br>Main article: <a data-href="Animal and plant cloning" href="biology/biotechnology/applications/animal-and-plant-cloning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Animal and plant cloning</a><br>Ethical issues:<br>
<br>Some people are against cloning as they believe humans should not play the role of God and manipulate the natural reproductive process of organisms.
<br>Animal cloning (using nuclear transfer) has a low success rate. The clones may develop abnormally, and may cause suffering to the animal clones.
<br>Ethical issues (humans):<br>
<br>Human cloning will involve selection of better fitted individuals to be cloned, and promoting elitism and discrimination against the less fit.
<br>It is difficult to define the identity of the clone.
<br>Human cloning may cause confusion in family structures and relationships.
<br>Clones may be treated as inferior class of human beings, labors or commercial products to be traded, lowering the value of human lives.
<br>Using organs from human clones for transplantation is morally unacceptable because this kills the clones who are also human beings.
<br>Economic issues:<br>
<br>Cost of cloning animals is high, it should be spent on more pressing and less controversial studies.<br>
Example: If cloning is used on endangered species due to loss of habitat, the funds should be spent on conserving habitats instead.
<br>Environmental issues:<br>
<br>Extensive cloning reduces genetic variations. The population of clones may be more susceptible to diseases or changes in the environment.
<br>Biodiversity is reduced. Genetic variations required for <a data-href="evolution" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/evolution/evolution.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">evolution</a> will be reduced.

<br>Genetic testing may cause unnecessary psychological burdens.
<br>People may live in distress after they had been diagnosed for carrying disease-related genes.
<br>There will be a debate on the types of diseases applicable for using genetic screening (life-threatening diseases or milder diseases).
<br>Legal issues:<br>
<br>Disputes may arise about the ownership of genetic information. People are concerned about the privacy of genetic information.
<br>Social issues:<br>
<br>Knowing a person’s genetic information may cause discrimination and social inequality (e.g. unequal opportunities for education and jobs).

<br>Gene therapy might be misused to enhance appearance or improve athletic performance.
<br>Gene therapy may be misused to modify gametes so that parents can choose desirable characteristics for their offspring.
<br>Health issues:<br>
<br>The use of viral vectors may cause severe immune reactions in patients, as it may become regain the ability to cause diseases / pathogenic again.
<br>The new genes may be wrongly delivered to non-target cells or inappropriately expressed. New genes inserted into the genome may affect the expression of existing genes and cause cancers.
<br>Somatic cell gene therapy does not offer a permanent cure, the cells containing the therapeutic genes may die, or the genes may degenerate, and the diseases may reappear again as a result.
<br>Legal issues:<br>
<br>Laws may be needed to prevent abuse / misuse of gene therapy.
<br>Laws may be needed to ensure consent to gene therapy may be given only by a patient who is fully informed and capable of making decisions.
<br>Social issues:<br>
<br>Cost of gene therapy is high, most people cannot afford treatment. Social inequality will become worse.

 <br><br>Turgidity is a means of support for herbaceous stems and non-woody parts of plants (e.g. leaves). They rely mainly on the turgidity of thin-walled cells (e.g. pith, cortex) for support.<br>Sufficient water supply:<br>
<br>Thin-walled cells gain water from xylem vessels by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a> and becomes turgid.
<br>The stem stands upright.
<br>Insufficient water supply: (during hot &amp; dry days) <br>
<br>Transpiration rate becomes higher than water absorption rate.
<br>Thin-walled cells lose water and becomes flaccid.
<br>The stem is no longer supported, and bends.
<br>The plant wilts.
<br><br>Rigidity is a means of mechanical support in woody plants. They rely mainly on the rigidity of thick-walled cells of xylem vessels.<br>Properties of xylem vessels for support:<br>
<br>Cell walls of xylem vessels are thick and lignified, making them hard and rigid.
<br>Supports plants even without sufficient water supply, as they consists of dead cells.
<br>Wood
Wood contributes to the strength of woody stems.
It is formed when older xylem vessels are pushed towards the centre during growth, and develops into wood as they are further hardened with lignin, forming annual rings.

 <br>Transpiration is the process where a plant loses water in the form of water vapour by evaporation.<br>Most plants absorb water from soil continuously. Most of the water absorbed by a plant is lost through transpiration, only a very small amount is used by the plants in <a data-href="photosynthesis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/photosynthesis/photosynthesis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">photosynthesis</a> and other cellular activities.<br>Loss of water:<br>
<br>Most of the water is lost through the stomata.
<br>Small portions of water are lost through the cuticle present on surfaces of leaves and herbaceous stems, and lenticels of woody stems.
<br><br><img alt="transpiration_process.webp" src="lib/media/transpiration_process.webp"><br><br>
<br>
Setting up transpiration pull<br>
Transpiration pull is the main force which <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Transport of substances" data-href="Transport of substances" href="biology/botany/processes/transpiration/transport-of-substances.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">transports water and dissolved minerals up the xylem vessels from the roots to the leaves</a>.

<br>
Absorption of water and dissolved minerals<br>
Water is lost in order to absorb water by transpiration pull, a form of 'necessary evil'.

<br>
Prevents over-heating in hot weather<br>
Water takes away heat from the plant surfaces when it evaporates, reducing the temperature of the plant.

<br><br><br><img alt="transpiration_relative_humidity.webp" src="lib/media/transpiration_relative_humidity.webp" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Effects: Rate of transpiration decreases with increasing relative humidity.<br>
(higher concentration of water vapour in atmosphere)<br>Explanation:<br>
<br>A higher relative humidity decreases the concentration gradient of water vapour between air spaces in leaves and surrounding air.
<br>Water vapour diffuses out of the air spaces more slowly.
<br><br><img alt="transpiration_temperature.webp" src="lib/media/transpiration_temperature.webp" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Effects: Rate of transpiration increases with increasing relative humidity.<br>Explanation:<br>
<br>A higher temperature increases the rate of water evaporation from surfaces of mesophyll cells.
<br>Air can hold more water vapour at higher temperature (relative humidity of surrounding air is lowered), so concentration gradient of water vapour between air spaces and atmosphere is increased.
<br><br><img alt="transpiration_wind.webp" src="lib/media/transpiration_wind.webp" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;"><br>In still air: Lower transpiration rate<br>
<br>Water vapour accumulates around the stomata after diffusing out of the leaves.
<br>Concentration gradient of water vapour between air spaces and atmosphere is reduced, water vapour diffuses out of the leaves more slowly.
<br>In windy conditions: Higher transpiration rate<br>
<br>Air current carries water vapour away from the leaf surfaces.
<br>Concentration gradient of water vapour between air spaces and atmosphere is increased, water vapour diffuses out of the leaves more quickly.
<br><br><img alt="transpiration_light.webp" src="lib/media/transpiration_light.webp" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Effects: Rate of transpiration increases with light intensity.<br>Explanation:<br>
<br>As light intensity increases, the stomata opens wider, more water vapour in the air spaces diffuses out of the leaves.
<br>Leaf temperature increases at higher light intensities, as light intensity is usually correlated with illumination by sunlight.
<br><br>
<br>Adequate soil water allow plants to transpire at higher rates as the soil can provide enough water to replenish the loss.
<br>Dry soil will make the plant undergo water stress, as water loss is not replenished, the stomata closes, decreasing the rate of transpiration.
<br><br>
<br>
Density and distribution of stomata on leaves<br>
In terrestrial dicotyledonous plants, there are fewer stomata on the upper epidermis of the leaves. This reduces water loss when the leaves are directly exposed to sunlight.

<br>
Leaf area<br>
The greater the total area of a plant, the more cuticle and stomata will be present, the greater is the rate of transpiration.

<br><br>See also: <a data-href="Leaves" href="biology/botany/structures/leaves.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Leaves</a><br>
<br>
Waxy cuticle covers the epidermis<br>
The epidermis is covered by a layer of waxy cuticle that is impermeable to water, reducing evaporation of water from the inner tissues of the leaves.

<br>
Guard cells control the size of the stomata<br>
When light is not available for <a data-href="photosynthesis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/photosynthesis/photosynthesis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">photosynthesis</a> or the plant becomes <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Water (Photosynthesis)" data-href="Water (Photosynthesis)" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/photosynthesis/components/water-(photosynthesis).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">dehydrated</a>, the stomata close and water loss from the leaves is reduced.

<br>
Distribution of stomata<br>
The upper epidermis usually has fewer stomata than the lower epidermis to reduce the transpiration rate of the leaves, as the upper surfaces of leaves are directly lit by sunlight and its temperature will be higher.

<br>Vessel cells are dead and elongated with no cell content (organelles)
<br>Has no end walls between adjacent cells
<br>Adaptations of xylem

<br>The xylem vessels form a hollow tube with little resistance.
<br>Thick and lignified vessels provide mechanical support to keep the vessels open, even with negative pressure created during transpiration pull.

<br><br>The phloem transports organic nutrients (e.g. sucrose and amino acids) within the plant.<br>Structural features &amp; adaptations:<br>
<br>Sieve tubes have cytoplasm but no nucleus. This allows organic nutrients to flow with little resistance.
<br>Sieve plates have many small pores. This allows organic nutrients to move from cell to cell.
<br>Companion cells have cytoplasm, a nucleus, and large numbers of mitochondria to provide energy for metabolic activities (<a data-href="active transport" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/active-transport.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">active transport</a> of organic nutrients) of the sieve tube.

<br>Loss of water from xylem vessels of leaves creates transpiration pull to draw water up the xylem vessels from roots to leaves.
<br>Transpiration pull draws water from xylem vessels of roots, creating a water potential gradient from xylem vessels to the root epidermis.
<br>Water potential of root hair cells becomes lower than soil water. Water moves into root hair cells by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a>.

<br>A potometer can only measure the rate of water uptake.
<br>Assumptions:<br>
<br>Any loss of mass is due to transpiration.
<br>Precautions:<br>
<br>A leafy shoot should be cut under water to prevent air bubbles from entering the xylem vessels and blocking water uptake.
<br>All connections should be smeared with vaseline to prevent leakage of water.
<br>An oil layer is added to prevent the evaporation of water, which can cause overestimation of water loss.
<br>Calculation:<br>
<br>Volume of water absorbed is equal to the drop in water level in the burette, while the volume of water loss by transpiration is the decrease in the weight of the whole set-up.
<br>The amount of water absorbed is slightly greater than the amount of water lost by the leafy shoot.

<br>Broad: Provide a large surface area for gas exchange, and absorbing light for photosynthesis.
<br>Flat and thin: Shorten the diffusion distance for gases to reach the mesophyll cells (between internal and external environment), as well as allowing light to reach photosynthetic cells easily.
<br><br>
<br>Closely-packed cells: Protect the inner tissues of the leaf from mechanical damage and infections.
<br>Covered by a thin waxy cuticle: Impermeable to water and reduces the loss of water by evaporation.
<br>Transparent cuticle &amp; epidermis: Most epidermal cells do not contain chloroplasts, which allows light to penetrate and reach the photosynthetic mesophyll beneath them.
<br><br>Palisade mesophyll:<br>
<br>Tightly-packed columnar cells: Higher density of chloroplasts for carrying out photosynthesis.
<br>Located on upper layer of leaves: Cells are under direct illumination by sunlight and helps maximize the amount of light absorbed for photosynthesis.
<br>Spongy mesophyll:<br>
<br>Loosely-packed cells: Lower density of chloroplasts than palisade mesophyll.
<br>Lots of large air spaces: Provides a large surface area and allows gases to diffuse freely inside the leaf for gas exchange to facilitate photosynthesis.
<br>Presence of moist water film: Water film covering the surfaces of these cells allows gases to first dissolve in it and diffuse into cells readily.
<br>Experiment on presence of air spaces
When a leaf is put into a hot water bath, the air in the air spaces expands and bubbles appear on the surface of the leaf.
<br><br><img alt="leaf_stomata.webp" src="lib/media/leaf_stomata.webp" style="width: 480px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Stomata:<br>
<br>Allow gases to pass into or out of the leaf rapidly for gas exchange.
<br>In bright sunlight, the size of the stoma will become larger, more carbon dioxide in air could diffuse through stomatal pores into the air spaces, photosynthesis occurs at a higher rate.
<br>Lower epidermis of leaves contains more stomata than the upper epidermis. This can reduce water loss as the temperature of the upper epidermis is higher under direct sunlight.
<br>They are also present on stems of herbaceous plants for gas exchange.
<br>Info
The difference in density of stomata can be observed by peeling off the upper and lower epidermis, and observing them under the microscope separately.
<br>Guard cells:<br>
<br>Surrounds the stomata to allow regulation of the size of stomata and rate of gas exchange.
<br>The inner wall is thicker than the outer wall. This allows the outer wall to stretch more than the inner wall for the cell to bend when it is turgid, opening the stomata for gas exchange.
<br>Aquatic plants have no guard cells as gas exchange occurs all over the plant surfaces.

<br>Atmospheric gases and carbon dioxide dissolves in the water film on the leaf and then diffuses in and out through the entire surface of the leaf.
<br>Submerged leaves of aquatic plants:<br>
<br>Surrounded by bodies of water, and has no stomata and cuticle on the leaf surface, as there is no danger of desiccation.
<br>Leaf surface is permeable, so dissolved gases can diffuse directly into the leaves all over their surfaces.
<br>Floating leaves: (e.g. water lily)<br>
<br>Has stomata and cuticle only on the upper epidermis.
<br>Dissolved gases can directly diffuse into the leaves through the lower epidermis.
<br>Woody plants:<br>
<br>Have stems surrounded by cork (an outer layer of protective tissues) that is impermeable to gases.
<br>With lenticels (small openings) where cork cells are loosely packed to allow gas exchange.

 <br>Roots anchor the plant in the soil and absorb water and minerals.<br><img alt="root_structure.webp" src="lib/media/root_structure.webp"><br>Structures:<br>
<br>Epidermis: Protects the inner tissues from injuries and infections.
<br>Root cap: Protects the root tip, where its cells have to be continually replaced as they are rubbed off when the root grows through soil.
<br>Cortex: Made up of layers of thin-walled cells to store food, and allow water and minerals to move across the root.
<br>Vascular bundle: Consists of xylem (transports water and minerals) and phloem (transports food), located in the center of the root.
<br>Adaptations (absorption of water &amp; minerals):<br>
<br>The epidermis is not covered by cuticle, so water and minerals can enter the root easily, and allow <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Gas exchange in plants" data-href="Gas exchange in plants" href="biology/botany/processes/gas-exchange/gas-exchange-in-plants.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">gas exchange</a> to occurs freely.
<br>The epidermis consists of one layer of closely-packed thin-walled cells, while root hair cells have thin cell walls. This provides a short <a data-href="diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusion</a> distance for water and minerals.
<br>Roots are highly branched and root hairs are numerous. This increases the surface area for absorption of water and minerals.
<br>Roots have long and fine root hairs (outgrowths). This allows the roots to reach into spaces between soil particles to absorb water and minerals more efficiently.
<br>Root hair cells contain many <a data-href="mitochondria" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/mitochondria.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mitochondria</a> to provide energy for the absorption of minerals by <a data-href="active transport" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/active-transport.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">active transport</a>.
<br>Absorption (water in roots):<br>
<br>
Water is absorbed into the root hair cells by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a>.<br>
The cytoplasm and cell sap of root hair cells contain dissolved substances, the water potential of root hair cells is usually lower than that of soil water.

<br>
Water moves from the root hair cells into the neighbouring cells.

<br>Water moves inwards from cell to cell by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a> down a water potential gradient (water potential of root hair cells &gt; neighbouring cells in cortex; due to water absorption) across the cortex.
<br>Some of the water moves between the cell walls of adjacent cells without entering the cytoplasm or the vacuole of the cells.


<br>
Water is drawn up by transpiration pull created by the evaporation of water from the leaves.

<br>Absorption (minerals in roots):<br>
<br>Normal conditions: Concentration of mineral ions in root hair cells is higher than surrounding soil water. Mineral ions are taken up into the root by <a data-href="active transport" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/active-transport.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">active transport</a> against a concentration gradient requiring energy from <a data-href="respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">respiration</a>.

 <br>Animals (scientifically Animalia) are a diverse group of multicellular eukaryotes. They belong in the domain Eukarya. They can be classified by the living habitats and anatomical characteristics.<br>Characteristics:<br>
<br>Have no cell walls.
<br>Most can move from place to place<br>
(exceptions include primitive early organisms, like sponge)
<br>Nutrition:<br>

Classification of animals ⤴️<br><br>Invertebrates are animals that do not have a vertebral column.<br>General characteristics:<br>
<br>Generally soft-bodied, lacking a rigid internal skeleton for the attachment of muscles.
<br>Some have a hydroskeleton (e.g. jellyfish, earthworms), an enclosed, liquid-filled cavity using liquid pressure to provide support.
<br>Some have an exoskeleton. It is a hard or tough outer shell, providing a framework for support, protecting soft body tissues, and preventing water loss.
<br><br>Vertebrates are animals that have a vertebral column, which form part of their internal skeleton of bones or cartilage.<br><br>Fish is a group of organisms living in water.<br>Anatomical characteristics:<br>
<br>Have grills for gas exchange.
<br>Have fins for swimming and balancing in water.
<br>Have streamlined body that reduces resistance while swimming.
<br>Have lateral lines along each side of a fish's body, with sense organ that detects changes in surrounding water pressure caused by predators or prey.
<br>Ectotherms - Mainly gain heat from the environment, body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings. (<a data-href="Water#As a temperature buffer" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/molecules-of-life/water.html#As_a_temperature_buffer" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Water &gt; As a temperature buffer</a>)
<br>Most have a swim bladder, a sac-like organ containing gas that allow them to go up an down by the changes in gas pressure.
<br>Most are covered with wet, slimy scales.
<br>Reproduction:<br>
<br>Sexual, through external fertilization (eggs fertilized outside the body).
<br>Gametes are released into the surrounding water, where fertilization takes place.
<br>Examples: goldfish, eels, sharks, seahorses<br><br>Amphibians are organisms that live part of their live in water and part of their life on land.<br>Characteristics:<br>
<br>Have smooth / naked skin.
<br>Tadpoles use grills for gas exchange, adult amphibians use lungs and skin surface for gas exchange.
<br>Most adults amphibians have four limbs.
<br>Ectotherms - Mainly gain heat from the environment, body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings.
<br>Reproduction:<br>
<br>Sexual, through external fertilization (eggs fertilized outside the body).
<br>Gametes are released into the surrounding water, where fertilization takes place.
<br>Life cycle:<br>

<br>Covered with dry, hard scales, which offer protection and prevent water loss.
<br>Ectotherms - Mainly gain heat from the environment, body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings.
<br>Reproduction:<br>
<br>Sexual, through internal fertilization (eggs are fertilized inside the female's body).
<br>Most lay eggs with a leathery or hard shell, preventing the eggs from desiccation on land and protects the embryo inside.

Classification of plants ⤴️<br>Classification by flowering

<br>Only flowering plants produce flowers.
<br>Sometimes, plants are classified by whether they can produce flowers.

<br><br>Non-vascular plants (e.g. mosses) are small plants with simple leaves and stems lacking vascular tissues to support its body against gravity.<br>General characteristics:<br>
<br>No true roots - Have rhizoids (root-like structures) to anchor them to substrates.
<br>Live in damp, shady places.
<br>Absorb water and minerals through the whole surface of the plant.
<br>Materials move from cell to cell within the plant by <a data-href="diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusion</a> and <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a>.

<br><br>Vascular plants have vascular tissues for transport of materials and support.<br>General characteristics:<br>
<br>Have true roots, leaves and stems.
<br>Larger and taller than non-vascular plants.
<br>Well adapted to dry habitats.
<br><br>Ferns are seedless vascular plants.<br>
<br>Most have large, feathery leaves, with curled young leaves.

<br><br>Conifers (e.g. pines, firs, cypresses) are a group of tall trees.<br>
<br>Most are evergreen and have needle-shaped leaves.
<br>Gymnosperms - have naked seeds enclosed in cones for (sexual) reproduction, but do not produce flowers.
<br>Can reproduce asexually by spores.
<br><br>Flowering plants are a diverse group of vascular seed plants that produce flowers. <br>
<br>Angiosperms - have seeds enclosed in fruits formed from the ovary of flowers.

 <br>Mutualism is a type of symbiosis where two species benefit by living together.<br><br>Examples:<br>
<br>
Lichen (on tree trunks or rock surfaces)<br>
Lichen carries out <a data-href="photosynthesis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/photosynthesis/photosynthesis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">photosynthesis</a> to produce organic food for itself and the fungus, while fungus provides anchorage, absorbs water and minerals, and protects the lichen.

<br>
Sea anemones &amp; Hermit crabs<br>
Sea anemones obtain food remains from hermit crab and are carried about by them, and provides protection to the hermit crabs, which posses stinging cells on their tentacles for defence against predators.

<br>
Herbivores (e.g. cows, sheep)<br>
Herbivores rely on mutualistic bacteria living in their intestines to break down the cellulose in the plants they eat, while bacteria receive shelter and a steady supply of food from the host.

Instead, they absorb food from host plants on which it grows.
<br>Host plants are deprived of nutrients and becomes weak and vulnerable to diseases, while it can also spread plant diseases from one host to another.


<br>
Ticks

<br>Ticks are arthropods (invertebrates with jointed legs) that feed on the blood of their hosts (e.g. mammals, birds).


<br>
Tapeworms

<br>They live in the small intestine of mammals (e.g. humans, pigs) to absorb digested food from hosts.
<br>Hosts are harmed by the loss of nutrients.

Barnacles and crabs

<br>A barnacle may root itself inside a crab and live inside it, but it does not kill the crab.

At :<br>
<br>When the predator population is low, the prey population increases rapidly.
<br>A greater prey population provides more food for the rapid increase (reproduction) in predator population.
<br>At :<br>
<br>When the predator population increases, predation occurs more frequently.
<br>Increased predation causes the prey population to drop.
<br>At :<br>
<br>A drop in prey population results in less food supply for predators.
<br>Decreased food supply cannot support the reproduction of predators, the predator population will drop subsequently.<br>
→ The cycle repeats.
<br>Deduction from the graph:<br>
<br>Predator population always lag behind the changes in the prey population, and the prey population is larger than the predator population.
<br>Prey population does not drop to zero, as it becomes difficult for the predator to locate remaining prey when prey population becomes extremely low.
<br>Tip
Relationships involving a single predator and prey species is unlikely to exist in nature. There will be other predator and prey species, as well as additional factors that will affect the sizes of the respective populations.

<br>
Terrestrial habitats

<br>Plants tend to reach a higher position (by growing tall or climbing up other plants) so that they are not blocked from sunlight. (e.g. Ivy)
<br>Plants growing in shady areas have larger leaves to absorb more light for <a data-href="photosynthesis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/photosynthesis/photosynthesis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">photosynthesis</a> and/or more chlorophyll to absorb more sunlight, and its leaves appear darker.


<br>
Aquatic habitats

<br>Light intensity determines the distribution of plants, decreasing with increasing water depth.
<br>Aquatic plants often live in shallow waters to receive more light got <a data-href="photosynthesis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/photosynthesis/photosynthesis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">photosynthesis</a>.


<br><br>Relative length of daylight and night-time can affect the flowering of plants.<br>
<br>Some flower during late spring or early summer. (e.g. Iris)
<br>Some flower during late summer or autumn. (e.g. Chrysanthemum)
<br><br>
<br>Diurnal animals are active during the day and rest at night.
<br>Nocturnal animals are only active at night. They are adapted to live in dark environments. (e.g. owls, bats)
<br><br>Metabolic and structural adaptations of an organism determines the temperature range it may survive in.<br><br>
<br>Some survive in cold regions.<br>
(e.g. pine trees, wheat, cabbages)
<br>Some grow in warm tropical or subtropical regions.<br>
(e.g. bananas, pineapples, sugar cane)

<br><br>
<br>Homoiotherms (e.g. mammals, birds)

<br>They can maintain a fairly constant body temperature by physiological means.
<br>They can remain active irrespective of the environmental temperature.
<br>They can inhibit a wider geographical range with a higher chance of survival.


<br>Birds as homoiotherms
Birds are able to maintain the body temperature by muscular contractions during flapping.
<br>
<br>Poikilotherms (e.g. fish, amphibians, reptiles)

<br>They cannot maintain a constant body temperature, which varies with environmental temperature.
<br>These animal are restricted to areas with a narrower temperature range.


<br><br>
<br>
Cold climates (e.g. seals)<br>
They have a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, which helps reduce heat loss from the body and acts as an energy reserve.

<br>
Hot climates (e.g. elephants)<br>
They have larger ears and longer limbs, giving them a larger surface area to promote heat loss.

<br><br>
<br>
Hibernation (e.g. amphibians, reptiles, mammals)<br>
Metabolic rate becomes so slow that energy usage and heat loss can be reduced greatly.

<br>
Migration<br>
Species of birds and butterflies migrate to warmer regions during the winter.

<br><br>Rainfall is the major source of water for terrestrial organisms, while humidity would affect the rate of water loss.<br><br>The types of organisms below are adapted to survive in environments with little water (e.g. deserts): <br>
<br>
Xerophytes (e.g. cacti)

<br>They have an extensive root system to absorb water from a large area.
<br>They may store water in their stems.
<br>They may be covered with a thick cuticle or have their leaves modified into spines to reduce water loss by <a data-href="transpiration" href="biology/botany/processes/transpiration/transpiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">transpiration</a>.


<br>
Desert kangaroo rats

<br>They obtain most of their water from metabolism.
<br>They have highly effective kidneys that produce very concentrated urine to reduce water loss through urination.
<br>Their nasal passages help reabsorb moisture from exhaled air.
<br>They are nocturnal and stay in cool holes during the day to reduce water loss by sweating.


<br><br>It affects the distribution and growth of plants.<br>
<br>Some depends on wind for <a data-href="pollination" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/reproduction/plants/pollination.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">pollination</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dispersal of seeds and fruits" data-href="Dispersal of seeds and fruits" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/reproduction/plants/dispersal-of-seeds-and-fruits.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">dispersal of seeds</a>.<br>
(e.g. cedar tree, dandelion)
<br>Wind direction affects the direction of growth of plants.<br>
(e.g. trees)
<br>In windy conditions, plants are likely to lose a lot of water through <a data-href="transpiration" href="biology/botany/processes/transpiration/transpiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">transpiration</a>. They may have fleshy leaves with a thick cuticle to prevent excessive water loss.<br><br><br>Shore animals have hard shells to protect them from strong waves.<br>
<br>Barnacles secrete a cement-like substance to attach to rock surfaces.
<br>Chitons and limpets have muscular foot to hold onto rocks.
<br>Crabs may hide under rocks.
<br><br>
<br>They have a streamlined and flattened body, swimming against water current with little resistance.
<br>They have their mouth or fins modified to function like suckers, holding onto rocks.
<br><br>
<br>
Freshwater habitat<br>
Organisms face a constant influx of water from the surrounding hypotonic medium, and has to remove excessive water from their bodies.

<br>
Salt water (sea water) (e.g. mangrove plants)<br>
Marine organisms has to remove excessive salts and reduce water loss from their bodes.

<br>Water potential and osmosis
Salinity affects the water potential of the environment, and the amount of water and minerals an organism can obtain from the environment.
<br>Mangrove plants

<br>Their roots are immersed in sea water.
<br>Their leaves have salt glands to allow them to maintain osmotic balance by removing excessive salts.
<br>Their leaves have thick cuticles to reduce water loss (by osmosis).

<br><br><br>
<br>
Temperature<br>
When temperature increases, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases, concentration of dissolved oxygen decreases.

<br>
Water movements<br>
Concentration of dissolved oxygen increases when water flows more quickly, as turbulence and splashing can bring more water in contact with oxygen in air.

<br>
Organic matter<br>
Concentration of dissolved oxygen decreases with more organic matter in water because the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms uses oxygen.

<br>Mangrove plants

<br>They have aerial roots that grow above the waterlogged soil, with many lenticels to maximize the gas exchange with air.

<br>Aquatic insects

<br>Water scorpions can breathe through a breathing tube that extend out of the water.

<br><br>
<br>
Cold, fast-moving water (e.g. trout)<br>
These regions have higher concentration of dissolved oxygen, and more species that need high concentrations of dissolved oxygen.

<br>
Warm, still water (e.g. carp)<br>
These regions have lower concentration of dissolved oxygen, and more species that are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations.

<br>Species diversity
Concentration of dissolved oxygen determines the species and the number of organisms an aquatic habitat can support.
<br><br>Soil provides a place for elongation of roots and anchorage. Different properties of soil affects the types of animals present in the habitat.<br><br>
<br>
Sand<br>
Made up of relatively large soil particles with large air spaces, and it cannot provide enough anchorage for large plants.

<br>
Silt &amp; clay<br>
Made up of smaller particles and are more closely packed. When flooded with water, they become waterlogged easily, so the oxygen content becomes very low (poorly aerated).

<br><br>
<br>Nutrients in soil mainly come from organic matter in animal droppings and the remains of dead organism.
<br>Humus formed from the decomposition of organic matter by detritivores (animals feeding on decomposing organic matter) and microorganisms help retain moisture and improve fertility of soil.
<br><br>Soil pH affects the solubility of inorganic ions in soil water and the amount of nutrients available to plants.

 <br><br>
<br>A habitat is a physical area where an organism lives with all the necessary conditions for their survival.
<br>A niche is the special ecological role each species is adapted to in a community. It is determined by the habitat where the organism lives, food it eats, relationships with other organisms and its effects on the environment.
<br>Tip
Many species share the same habitat, but each species occupies a specific niche.<br>
No two species can occupy the same niche in the same habitat at the same time. Otherwise, there will be fierce <a data-href="competition" href="biology/ecology-&amp;-biodiversity/ecosystems/components/symbiosis/competition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">competition</a> for resources.
<br><br><img alt="species_diversity.webp" src="lib/media/species_diversity.webp"><br>Factors:<br>
<br>Species richness: Number of different species in a community.
<br>Relative abundance: Proportion of the community that each species occupies.
<br>Dominant species: Most abundant species (or occupies the highest biomass)<br>
<br>The higher the species richness and the more similar the relative abundances of different species, the greater the species diversity.
<br>They have a strong influence on the composition and diversity of the community.

 <br>Ecological succession is a series of progressive changes in the composition of a biotic community (species &amp; habitat) over time.<br>A climax community is a stable state reached when the habitat supports the most diverse community it is capable of. It is only replaced when there are drastic changes (e.g. natural disasters, human disturbances).<br><br>Primary succession occurs in a barren area where no communities existed previously, with only bare rocks present. The process of primary succession can take hundreds of years (longer).<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Lava flows from volcano and hardens
<br>Glacier retreats
<br>Pioneer species are the first species to colonize a barren area, forming the pioneer community and modify the environment gradually to provide suitable conditions for colonization by a succession of communities.<br>Process of primary succession:<br>
<br>
Bare rocks<br>
The environment is abiotic.

<br>
Lichens and mosses

<br>Spores of lichens and mosses are carried to bare rocks by wind. They colonize rock surfaces and form the pioneer community.
<br>Soil gradually develops as rocks break down and organic matter accumulates.


<br>
Ferns and grasses

<br>The soil becomes thick enough to support ferns and grasses (smaller plants).
<br>As they grow, they replace the lichens and mosses and become the dominant species.
<br>They provide food and shelter for insects (smaller animals).


<br>
Shrubs

<br>Soil continues to form. Larger plants like shrubs start to grow.
<br>Shrubs grow over ferns and grasses and become the dominant species.
<br>More animals, such as birds and small mammals, are attracted to the habitat.
<br>Humus formed from the decomposition of organic wastes and dead bodies of organisms enrich the soil.


<br>
Trees

<br>The soil becomes thick and rich enough to support the growth of trees.
<br>The canopy of trees over-shadow the shrubs and they become the dominant species. The habitat becomes a woodland.
<br>More animals join the community, a climax community is reached.


<br><br>Secondary succession involves the restoration of the community after a major disturbance.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Abandoned agricultural fields
<br>After wildfires, storms or floods
<br>Differences to primary succession:<br>
<br>Starts with a more complex pioneer community (e.g. annual herbaceous plants)

<br>Soil may contain seeds, roots and underground vegetative parts of plants. They are not damaged in the disturbance.
<br>They can grow and develop into new plants when conditions become favourable.


<br>Occurs more rapidly as soil already exists.

Rocky shores: Coastal marine ecosystems consisting of rocks<br>
Organisms need to withstand strong waves and to resist desiccation when exposed to the air at low tides.

<br>
Mangroves: Intertidal wetland ecosystems<br>
Commonly found in estuaries where freshwater streams meet the sea, it contains waterlogged soil with high salinity. Organisms need to adapt to low water potential of surrounding environments.

<br>
Freshwater streams: Water flows from upstream to downstream<br>
Speed of water flow affects the distribution and abundance of organisms.

<br>
Woodlands: Dominated by broad-leaved trees<br>
Supports a wide variety of animals.

<br>
Grasslands: Dominated by grasses and herbs<br>
In Hong Kong, grasslands are found where frequent grazing or fire has prevented the growth of trees.

 <br>Ecological pyramids show the distribution of materials and energy along the trophic levels of an ecosystem. They are represented by bar charts, which can be upright or inverted.<br>In ecological pyramids, the producer always occupies the bottom of the pyramid.

<br>An organism may belong to more than one trophic level, it cannot easily be assigned to a single trophic level.
<br>Energy flow to decomposers is often not shown in ecological pyramids.

<br><br>Pyramid of numbers shows the number of organisms at each trophic level in an ecosystem in a given area at any one time.<br><img alt="py_of_num.webp" src="lib/media/py_of_num.webp" style="width: 240px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>Advantages: Relatively easy to collect data and information to construct pyramids of numbers.
<br>Disadvantages: Size of each organism is not taken into account, as each organism is counted irrespective of its size.
<br>Exceptional cases:<br>
<img alt="py_of_num_exp.webp" src="lib/media/py_of_num_exp.webp" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;"><br>

While they still store energy, they are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Large intestines > Egestion" data-href="Large intestines#Egestion" href="biology/anatomy/nutrition/digestion-&amp;-absorption/large-intestines.html#Egestion" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">egested</a> in faeces.

<br>
In uneaten dead bodies<br>
Some organisms die without being eaten, with the energy not transferred to higher levels.

<br>Reasons for decreasing number of organisms in higher trophic levels:<br>
<br>There is energy lost when energy is transferred to the next higher level.
<br>Preys (at lower levels) are usually smaller than its predator (at higher levels) in size. The predator needs to eat a large number of prey to get enough energy.
<br>Warning
There is no cycling of energy in an ecosystem. Energy lost cannot be recycled by the ecosystem.
<br>Tip

<br>Energy in excretory products, faeces and uneaten dead bodies become food for decomposers, which break down dead organic matter and release heat energy.
<br>A food chain normally does not consist of more than five trophic levels as the fifth trophic level does not get enough energy to support further levels.

 <br><br><br>Wildlife is being overexploited by humans in the field of:<br>
<br>Food and culinary — Overfishing of bluefin tuna
<br>Medicines — Hunting of rhino for their horns
<br>Decorative products — Hunting of elephants for their tusks for making ivory products
<br>This may result in extinction of the species, and increase in the population of its prey.<br><br><br>
<br>Trees are being cut down on a massive scale to obtain timber, or to obtain land for agriculture or urban development. This is especially in tropical rainforests.
<br>It destroys the natural habitats of wildlife and leads to a reduction in biodiversity.
<br><br>
<br>Refers to the cultivation of a single crop in a given area.
<br>Leads to a loss of species, an increase in pest population and destruction of natural habitats.
<br><br>Pollutants are being released into the environment in harmful amounts as a result of human activities.<br><br>
<br>
Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels<br>
When large amounts of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, it enhances the greenhouse effect and results in global warming.

<br>
Acid rain caused by sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides<br>
Reaction of these gases with water vapour and oxygen in the air form acids, resulting in the formation of acid rain. Acid rain can harm both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

<br>
Toxic chemicals in industrial sewage (e.g. heavy metal ions – Hg &amp; Pb)<br>
Untreated sewage being discharged into rivers or the sea will contaminate the water. Toxic chemicals may be taken up by aquatic organisms and transferred along food chains through feeding.

<br>
Disposal of solid wastes at landfills<br>
As the wastes breakdown, they release methane (also a greenhouse gas) and produce a toxic liquid called leachate. It will contaminate soil and groundwater if it leaks out of landfills.

<br><br>
<br>
Protection of natural habitats

<br>Setting up conservation areas (e.g. national parks)


<br>
Protection of wildlife

<br>Setting up laws to prohibit hunting of endangered species and trading of their body parts (e.g. ban on ivory trade)
<br>Breeding endangered species in zoos and botanical gardens (e.g. pandas)


<br>
Sustainable management of natural resources

<br>Restricting fishing activities during fishing moratorium to allow fish stocks to replenish


<br>
Reduction in waste production

<br>Implementing charging schemes for different kinds of waste<br>
(e.g. charging for plastic shopping bags)


<br>
Use of alternative energy sources

<br>Using renewable, environmentally friendly energy sources (e.g. solar energy, wind energy and hydro energy) to replace the use of fossil fuels


<br>
Pollution control

<br>Controlling emissions from factories and power plants
<br>Treating sewage before discharge

The greater the number of quadrat counts, the more reliable the estimate of the number of organisms will be.<br>Requirements for using quadrats:<br>
<br>They are only suitable for sampling plants, immobile or slow-moving animals.
<br>The size of the quadrat used depends on the size of the organisms being counted. A larger quadrat is used for larger organisms so that it encloses a reasonable number of individuals.
<br>If used alone, it is only suitable for uniform habitats (e.g. grassland).
<br><br>Transects are used in systematic sampling to study habitats where some form of gradual change (transition) in populations takes place.<br><br>Line transecting can be used to estimate the range of distribution of species in a habitat.<br>A transect is laid on the study site along a physical gradient (e.g. from upper shore towards lower shore of a wetland). Organisms that touch the transect are identified and recorded.<br>
<br>
Limitations:<br>
<br>Only organisms that touch the transect are identified and recorded.
<br>Line transecting does not estimate the abundance of the organisms.

<br><br>Density measures the number of individuals per a specific area of land. This is useful for species that are easy to count and not too numerous.<br>Formula:<br>
<br>
<br>Note
If some individuals are half inside the quadrat, those on two sides of the quadrats are counted as being in, while those on the other two sides are counted as being out.
<br><br>Percentage cover is an estimate of the area within a quadrat that a species covers. It is useful for species that are particularly abundant or difficult to count individually (e.g. mosses, algae).<br>Formula:<br>

 <br>Inflammatory responses are initiated when the body is wounded or infected.<br><br><img alt="inflammatory_response_diagram.webp" src="lib/media/inflammatory_response_diagram.webp"><br>
<br>The damaged tissue releases histamine.
<br>Arterioles nearby vasodilate so that more blood flows to the damaged tissues.
<br>Permeability of capillary walls increases, more phagocytes and blood plasma move out of capillaries and into tissue fluid.

<br>More tissue fluid is formed at the would, which helps dilute the toxins released by pathogens and reduce tissue damage.
<br>Phagocytes engulf pathogens and remove dead body cells, facilitating wound healing.


<br><br>
<br>Redness: Arterioles near the wound dilate, increasing blood flow to nearby tissues.
<br>Heat: Increased blood flow raises temperature of the wound.
<br>Swelling: Permeability of capillary walls increases, allowing more blood plasma to escape to form tissue fluid and accumulate at the wound.
<br>Pain: Built-up tissue fluid presses against nerve endings and stimulates pain receptors in the skin.
<br>Tip
Sometimes pus (yellowish fluid) forms at the wound, which contains dead phagocytes, the remains of pathogens and other dead cells.

 <br>Vaccines are introduced into the body for inducing immunity to a specific disease. They contain antigens which may come from one of the following sources:<br>
<br>Live, weakened (or attenuated) pathogens
<br>Dead pathogens
<br>Parts of the pathogen (e.g. viral proteins)
<br>Inactivated toxins produced by pathogens
<br>↪️ As vaccines do not contain active pathogens, they do not cause diseases.<br>Explanation:<br>
<br>Antigens present in a vaccine are recognized by lymphocytes to produce a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Primary and secondary response > Primary response" data-href="Primary and secondary response#Primary response" href="biology/immunology/body-defence-mechanisms/specific-defence/responses/primary-and-secondary-response.html#Primary_response" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">primary response</a>.

<br><br>Example: Influenza viruses undergo mutation easily. Explain why this characteristic of viruses make control of influenza difficult.<br>
<br>The virus will form a new strain.

 <br>Antibiotics are chemicals produced by certain bacteria and fungi which can kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microorganisms. The first known antibiotic Penicillin was produced by fungus Penicillium, which was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928 and later isolated by other scientists to treat infections.<br><br>Antibiotics kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria by disrupting essential processes or structures. Their actions include:<br>
<br>
Inhibiting formation of bacterial cell walls<br>
Bacterial cell walls may not form properly during cell division and becomes weakened. It eventually burst (lyse) due to the influx of water by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a>.

<br>
Disruption of cell membrane functions<br>
Antibiotics binds to or inserts into the bacterial membrane and cause permeabilization and depolarization. The interference with the membrane's integrity compromises bacterial structural stability and impairs vital functions, resulting in cell lysis.

<br>
Inhibiting protein synthesis<br>
Antibiotics bind to bacterial <a data-href="ribosomes" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/cellular-organisation/ribosomes.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ribosomes</a> and disrupts processes such as <a data-href="translation" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/molecular-genetics/translation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">translation</a> or <a data-href="transcription" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/molecular-genetics/transcription.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">transcription</a>. Growth and repair may not occur, growth of bacteria is inhibited.

<br>
Inhibiting synthesis of nucleic acids<br>
Bacterial cells cannot reproduce, inhibiting the growth of bacteria.

<br><br>
Indiscriminate use of antibiotics without proper jurisdiction might create a future threat for another pandemic due to antibiotic resistance. According to WHO, antibiotics become less effective against different strains of bacteria. (Daria S, Islam MR., 2022)
<br><br>
<br>Antibiotics are wrongly prescribed to treat viral infections (e.g. influenza).
<br>Patients prescribed antibiotics do not finish the whole course of antibiotics.
<br>Antibiotics are added to animal feeds indiscriminately to prevent illnesses among livestock.
<br><br><br>Indiscriminate usage of antibiotics has caused many antibiotics to become ineffective as it increases the chances for the development of antibiotic resistance.<br>Process of developing antibiotic resistance:<br>
<img alt="antibiotic_resistance_development.webp" src="lib/media/antibiotic_resistance_development.webp"><br>Multidrug-resistant bacteria (dubbed 'superbugs') have become more common, especially at hospitals and clinics. Infections caused by these bacteria are often incurable by conventional antibiotics and are often life-threatening.<br><br>The intestines of the human body hosts a large number of bacteria. Antibiotics may kill these bacteria. As a result, pathogenic bacteria will face less competition for resources, encouraging the growth of pathogenic bacteria so the disease may develop even faster. The removal of beneficial bacteria from the gut may also cause side effects, such as diarrhoea.<br><br>
Several studies have shown that the use of antibiotics early in life significantly increases the risk of asthma in children; and antibiotic overuse might be associated with increased risk of allergy-related disease. (Chen YL, Sng WJ, Wang Y, Wang XY., 2019)

 <br>The Koch's postulates are a set of criteria for determining whether a particular <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Types of pathogens" data-href="Types of pathogens" href="biology/immunology/health-and-diseases/infectious-diseases/types-of-pathogens.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">microorganism</a> is the cause of a specific <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Infectious diseases" data-href="Infectious diseases" href="biology/immunology/health-and-diseases/infectious-diseases/infectious-diseases.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">infectious disease</a>. It was proposed by German doctor Robert Koch in 1882.<br>
<br>
Postulate 1:<br>
The suspected pathogen must be found in all animals suffering from the disease, but not in healthy animals.<br>
(confirmed by microscopic observations of samples from healthy and infected animals)

<br>
Postulate 2:<br>
The pathogen must be isolated from the diseased animal and grown in pure culture.<br>
(streak agar plate with samples from diseased or healthy animal)

<br>
Postulate 3:<br>
The cultured pathogen must cause the same disease when introduced into a healthy animal.<br>
(introduce the suspected pathogen into a healthy animal)

<br>
Postulate 4:<br>
The same pathogen must be isolated from the infected animal.<br>
(take blood or tissue sample and observe under microscope and/or streak agar plates with it)

 <br><br>Transmission may occur through direct physical contact (e.g. touching, kissing, sexual intercourse), or sharing of personal items (e.g. towels, combs, clothes).<br>Pathogens may enter through wounds on the skin, or when rubbing our eyes or nose with hands that have contacted the pathogen.<br><br>
<br>Athlete's foot
<br>Chickenpox
<br>Hand, foot and mouth disease
<br>STIs (e.g. genital herpes, Gonorrhea)
<br><br>
<br>Avoid direct physical contact with infected persons. Wear protective gloves and clothing when taking care of infected persons.
<br>Do not share personal items (e.g. towels, combs or clothes).
<br>Maintain good personal hygiene (e.g. washing hands after contact with an infected person).
<br><br>When infected person talks, coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets of mucus and saliva containing pathogens are released into the air, with some landing on and contaminating nearby surfaces. Some pathogens transmitted may be so tiny that they can travel long distances and stay suspended in the air for a long time.<br>They enter another person's body when they reach the mucus membranes of the nose, eyes and mouth of another person.<br><br>
<br>Wearing a face mask if infected or when in close contact with infected persons.
<br>Cover the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and disinfecting the hands afterwards.
<br>Avoid going to crowded and poorly ventilated public areas when an air-borne disease is prevalent.
<br>Maintain good indoor ventilation so that droplets are blown away by fresh air.
<br>Frequently clean and disinfect surfaces which may be touched in public areas.<br>
(e.g. door handles, lift buttons, handrails, etc.)
<br><br><br>
<br>Eggs, meat or other food products from an infected animal
<br>When handling food with unwashed hands (after going to the toilet)
<br>Draining sewage (may contain faeces) into water supply systems without proper treatmentso
<br><br>
<br>Washing hands with liquid soap after going to the toilet and before handling food.
<br>Adopting food hygiene practices in food handling<br>
(e.g. use separate cooking utensils for handling raw and cooked food)
<br>Buying food from clean and reliable shops or markets.
<br>Cooking food and boil drinking water thoroughly, and at the right temperatures.
<br>Refrigerating food at the right temperature. Maintain the refrigerator at or below 4°C and the freezer at or below -18°C.
<br>Dispose of faeces and sewage only when treated properly.
<br><br>Some pathogens are present in body fluids (e.g. blood, semen and vaginal secretions) of infected persons. They may enter the body of another person through wounds, by sharing of needles or syringes, or during sexual intercourse.<br><br>
<br>HIV/AIDS
<br>Hepatitis B
<br>Syphilis
<br><br>
<br>Wearing gloves when treating wounds or handling blood.
<br>Avoid sharing toothbrushes, scalpels and other objects that may be contaminated with blood.
<br>Practice safe sex and wear a condom during sexual contact.
<br>Screen blood before transfusion.
<br>Never share injection and needles.
<br><br>Vectors are organisms that carries pathogens from one host to another.<br><br>
<br>
Cockroaches &amp; houseflies (e.g. Cholera)<br>
Feed on faeces in sewers or food waste, and their body parts may pick up the pathogens. Food may become contaminated if they land on or touch food items.

<br>
Mosquitoes (e.g. Malaria, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika fever)<br>
Bites infected persons and transfers their pathogens to a healthy person. Only female mosquitoes bite and suck blood from animals to obtain necessary proteins for their eggs, but male mosquitoes survive by feeding on nectar and fruit juices.

<br><br>
<br>
Do not leave food unattended<br>
Place food in covered containers so that cockroaches and houseflies cannot reach the food.

<br>
Kill vectors<br>
Spray pesticides or larvicidal oil around mosquito’s habitats.

<br>
Remove potential breeding grounds of vectors<br>
Clear standing water, a common breeding site for mosquitoes, and remove potential exposed sources of food so cockroaches would not invade the home.

<br>
Take action to avoid mosquito bites<br>
Wear light-coloured long-sleeved clothing, apply insect repellents and use mosquito nets or screens

 <br>Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth of malignant tumours that can invade nearby tissues.<br><br>Tumours are swollen masses of tissue formed by cells that divide uncontrollably and excessively when their genes that regulate cell division are mutated.<br><br><br>They are typically enclosed by a capsule made of connective tissues and do not spread to other parts of the body. However, they can cause problems when they press against an artery or a nerve, or when it grows in an endocrine glands, causing over-production of hormones and results in endocrine diseases.<br>
<img alt="benign_tumour.webp" src="lib/media/benign_tumour.webp" style="width: 450px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>They are cancerous tumours, as they can invade nearby tissues in the process called metastasis. They may also spread through the circulatory system or the lymphatic system to other body tissues. These cells can then develop into new malignant tumours.<br>
<img alt="malignant_tumour.webp" src="lib/media/malignant_tumour.webp"><br><br><br>In the risk factors listed below, some cannot be avoided. However, risk factors related to behaviour and lifestyle choices are modifiable. Therefore, it is possible to reduce exposure to carcinogens in the environment and adopt healthy lifestyles in order to reduce the risk of developing cancer.<br><br><br>
<br>Formation of malignant tumour involves multiple mutations. Ageing provides time for mutations to accumulate. Therefore, the risk of cancer increases significantly with age.
<br>They have also been exposed to substances that induce mutations for a longer time.
<br>Their immune systems are weaker and are less effective in removing cells that are becoming cancerous.
<br><br>
<br>Individuals with a family history of certain types of cancer (e.g. breast cancer, ovarian cancer &amp; colorectal cancer) are more likely to develop the same type of cacner.
<br>They may have inherited mutated genes (oncogenes) from their parents that increase the risk of cancer.
<br><br>Carcinogens are cancer-causing agents that may be present in the environment. Exposure to these agents increase the risk of cancer by causing gene mutations.<br><br>
<br>Exposure may result in damage to DNA in cells and cause <a data-href="mutations" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/molecular-genetics/mutations.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mutations</a>.
<br>Also used in medical procedures (e.g. X-ray scans), and may be released in accidents at nuclear power plants.
<br>Examples: X-rays, Gamma rays
<br><br>
<br>Has lower energy, but prolonged exposure also cause damage in DNA.
<br>Example: Sunlight → Skin cancer<br>
Sunscreen can be applied before going outdoors for prolonged periods of time.
<br><br>
<br>Asbestos: Used to strengthen and fireproof materials.<br>
Inhaled asbestos fibres become trapped in the body and may lead to lung cancer.
<br>Formaldehyde: Given off by new furniture and wooden floors made with certain types of glue. It may cause nasopharyngeal cancer and leukaemia.
<br>Benzene: Used for the manufacturing of plastics. Long-term exposure may cause harmful effects on the bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anaemia. It can also cause excessive bleeding and can affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection.
<br>Diesel exhaust: Pollute the air with PM2.5 fine particulate matter by fossil fuel combustion in motor vehicles and in power plants. May result in lung cancer when inhaled.
<br><br><br>
<br>Prevention: Vaccination, Regular check-ups, Practice safe sex
<br><br><br>
<br>Tar in cigarette smoke contains more than 40 carcinogens, which can cause lung cancer with increased risks of other types of cancers (e.g. cancers of the oesophagus, larynx, mouth and urinary bladder).
<br>Prevention: Quit smoking
<br><br>
<br>Too much alcohol can damage cells lining the mouth, throat, oesophagus and stomach. Attempted repairing of cells could lead to changes in DNA, increasing the risk of cancer of the digestive system.
<br>Highly toxic and carcinogenic by-product acetaldehyde (ethanol) forms during the breakdown of alcohol in the liver, increasing the risk of liver cancer.
<br>Prevention: Avoid consumption
<br><br>
<br>Processed meat (e.g. sausages and ham), grilled foods (e.g. barbecued meat) and fried foods may contain carcinogens. Eating them increase the risk of developing cancers in the stomach and the large intestine.
<br>A diet high in fat and red meat but low in dietary fibre increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
<br>Prevention: A healthy diet can be devised, see <a data-href="Balanced diet" href="biology/anatomy/nutrition/theory-of-nutrition/balanced-diet.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Balanced diet</a>.
<br><br>
<br>People who are physically inactive or have a sedentary lifestyle are more likely to be overweight or obese.
<br>Overweight is linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer.<br>
(e.g. breast, colorectal cancers)
<br>Prevention: Exercise regularly<br>
(e.g. doing at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity five times a week)
<br>
# Treatments
- **Surgery**
  Tumours can be removed before it had already spread to other parts of the body (metastasized).<br>
<br>
Radiotherapy<br>
High-energy radiation (e.g. X-rays or gamma rays) is used to destroy cancerous cells.<br>
It is suitable for treating cancers that have not yet metastasized.<br>
However, the radiation also damages healthy body cells around the treated regions.

<br>
Chemotherapy<br>
Anti-cancer drugs are used to kill cancerous cells or stop them from growing and spreading. As these drugs enter the bloodstream, it can reach almost all areas of the body.<br>
This is useful for treating cancers that has already metastasized, but it also kills actively dividing cells. (e.g. bone marrow cells → anaemia, hair follicles → hair loss)

<br>
Target therapy<br>
Use a wide range of drugs to interfere with genes and proteins that help cancerous cells grow and spread. It has fewer side effects as it acts on cancer cells only, but the drugs only target specific types of cancer with specific <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mutations > Gene mutations" data-href="Mutations#Gene mutations" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/molecular-genetics/mutations.html#Gene_mutations" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">gene mutations</a>, making it suitable for only a few patients.

<br>
Genetically modified therapy<br>
Use specific cells from a patient or donor to improve its cancer-tracking and cancer-attacking ability.

 <br>Cardiovascular diseases refer to two types of diseases:<br>
<br>Heart diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease)
<br>Cerebrovascular diseases (e.g. stroke)
<br><br>Cardiovascular diseases are caused by a build-up of plaque in arteries. A plaque forms when cholesterol and other fatty substances deposits on the inner wall of the artery. As it builds up and becomes larger in size, it narrows the artery and hardens the arterial wall.<br><img alt="plaque_photomicro.webp" src="lib/media/plaque_photomicro.webp" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;"><br>If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form on its surface, reducing blood flow through the artery.<br><img alt="plaque_progression.webp" src="lib/media/plaque_progression.webp"><br>As the blood clot forms, one of the following complications may arise:<br>
<br>Coronary heart disease: One or more coronary arteries is blocked or bursts, reducing blood flow to cardiac muscles, the cardiac muscle may die, resulting in a heart attack.
<br>Stroke: An artery in the brain is blocked or bursts. Blood supply to a part of the brain is reduced, and the brain cells nearby die due to insufficient oxygen supply.
<br>
# Risk factors
In the risk factors listed below, some cannot be avoided. However, risk factors related to behaviour and lifestyle choices are modifiable. Therefore, it is possible to adopt healthy lifestyles in order to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.<br><br><br>
<br>Ageing provides time for plaques to build up.
<br>They have also been exposed to other risk factors over time.
<br><br>
<br>Men have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases compared to women of the same age.
<br>Woman's risk after menopause is similar to man.
<br><br>
<br>Some genes are related to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.
<br>Individuals with a family history of cardiovascular diseases are more likely to develop these diseases.
<br><br><br>
<br>Nicotine: Increases blood viscosity and the chance of forming blood clots, and causes blood vessels to constrict and raises heart rate, forcing the heart to work harder.
<br>Carbon monoxide: Binds to haemoglobin readily and reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, forcing the heart to work harder to supply enough oxygen for body tissues.

<br>Increased workload of the heart leads to a higher risk of heart attack.


<br>Prevention: Quit smoking
<br><br>
<br>A diet high in saturated fat and trans fat raises the blood cholesterol level. Excess cholesterol slowly builds up in the inner walls of arteries and forms plaques as it circulates the blood.
<br>High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Eating foods with high salt content raises blood pressure.
<br>Prevention: A healthy lifestyle can be devised, see <a data-href="Balanced diet" href="biology/anatomy/nutrition/theory-of-nutrition/balanced-diet.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Balanced diet</a>.
<br><br>
<br>People who are physically inactive or have a sedentary lifestyle are more likely to be overweight or obese.
<br>Overweight individuals are more likely to have high blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
<br>Being overweight also makes the heart work harder, increasing the risk of heart attack.
<br>Prevention: Exercise regularly<br>
(e.g. doing at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity five times a week)
<br>
# Treatments
## Balloon angioplasty
![[balloon_angioplasty.webp|400]]
1. A small tube with a tiny balloon is inserted into the narrowed region of the artery.
2. The balloon is inflated and the plaque is flattened. The size of the lumen increases.
3. The balloon is deflated and withdrawn. The metal mash may be left in the artery to keep the artery open.<br><br><img alt="bypass_surgery.webp" src="lib/media/bypass_surgery.webp" style="width: 380px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>A short length of blood vessel is taken from another part of the body (usually the leg).
<br>The blood vessel is then grafted to connect the aorta and the coronary artery to bypass the blockage, creating an alternative pathway for blood to reach the cardiac muscle.

<br>Presence of large amount of glucose in urine<br>
The blood glucose levels are so high that the kidneys fail to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Reabsorption" data-href="Reabsorption" href="biology/neuroscience/physiology/water-content-regulation/reabsorption.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">reabsorb</a> all the glucose, and therefore excess glucose is excreted in urine.
<br>Tip
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in patients with diabetes due to the presence of large amounts of glucose in urine. This provides nutrients for bacterial growth.
<br>
<br>Frequent urination<br>
Body cells lose water to the blood by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a>, leading to an increase in blood volume and hence an increase in urine production.
<br>Note
Glucose is soluble in water and affects the water potential of the blood.<br>

<br>
<br>Intense thirst<br>
The decrease in water potential of the blood stimulates the 'thirst centre' in the brain, making the person thirsty.
<br><br>
<br>
Diabetes Type I (insulin-dependent diabetes)<br>
The pancreas does not secrete enough insulin.

<br>
Diabetes Type II (non-insulin-dependent diabetes)<br>
The body cells do not respond to insulin (insulin resistance).

<br><br><img alt="diabetes_graphs.webp" src="lib/media/diabetes_graphs.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
As body cells do not take up excess glucose from the blood, the blood glucose level of a diabetic may become abnormally high, especially after a meal.<br>Blood glucose level for a diabetic:<br>
<br>There is a larger rise (rises to a higher level) in the blood glucose level.
<br>The blood glucose level remains high for a longer time.
<br>Note

<br>The blood glucose level may fluctuate as the body tries to maintain a stable level by <a data-href="negative feedback mechanism" href="biology/neuroscience/homeostasis/negative-feedback-mechanism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">negative feedback mechanism</a>.
<br>The gradual decrease in blood glucose level is due to the lost of glucose in the urine.

<br>Blood insulin level for type I diabetes:<br>
<br>The blood insulin level is lower than a healthy person.
<br>Although there is an increase in the blood glucose level, the blood insulin level shows little change.
<br>Blood insulin level for type II diabetes:<br>
<br>The blood insulin level is higher than a healthy person.
<br>However, the blood glucose level will not fall even though there is a high insulin level, as the body cells do not respond to the insulin.
<br>Warning
Blood insulin level should lag behind the blood glucose level.
<br><br>
<br>They have to monitor their blood glucose levels (e.g. glucometer) at intervals throughout the day.
<br>They may need injections of insulin after meals to lower the blood glucose level.
<br>Note
Injection dose of insulin must be carefully controlled.
If too much insulin is injected, the blood glucose level may fall so low that body cells cannot obtain enough glucose for <a data-href="respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">respiration</a> and <a data-href="metabolism" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/metabolism/metabolism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">metabolism</a> will slow down.
<br><br>Meals should be high-fibre, low glycaemic index (GI) carbohydrates and be low in total saturated fats, added sugar and salt.<br>
<br>They can have frequent meals, but in small portions.
<br>They should avoid food which elevates blood glucose level in a short time.
<br><br>The glycemic index is a number from 0 to 100 assigned to a food, with pure glucose arbitrarily given the value of 100, which represents the relative rise in the blood glucose level two hours after consuming that food.<br>Note

<br>Low GI food will lead to small fluctuations in blood glucose level.
<br>The chance of having too high of a blood glucose level is reduced.

In conditions of low oxygen concentration, the abnormal haemoglobin molecules form long fibres within the red blood cells, causing them to become sickle-shaped.<br>Problem:<br>
<br>
Lower oxygen carrying capacity<br>
They do not carry oxygen as efficiently as normal red blood cells.

<br>
Red blood cells sticks together<br>
The red bloods tend to stick together, blocking blood vessels and prevent normal blood flow, causing organ damage.

<br>
Shorter lifespan than normal red blood cells<br>
The sickle-shaped cells are more likely to be damaged and have a shorter lifespan than normal red blood cells. The patients do not produce red blood cells fast enough to replace dead red blood cells, leading to anaemia.

(e.g. cancer &amp; heart diseases)<br><br>
<br>
Water and food safety<br>
Public services (e.g. WSD, FEHD) provides clean water and monitors food safety, protecting citizens from water-brone and food-brone diseases.

<br>
Environmental hygiene<br>
Public services (e.g. DSD, FEHD) offers treatment to household sewage, cleansing services (e.g. street sweeping and waste collection) and pest control services (e.g. monitoring mosquito levels).

<br>
Health and medical services

<br>Medical treatment services<br>
(e.g. through out-patient clinics, specialist clinics, hospitals)
<br>Disease monitoring (e.g. CHP)<br>
Alerts the public of possible health risks and takes timely measures (e.g. quarantine) to control the spread of infectious diseases.
<br>Preventive services

<br>Screening programmes: Allows early detection of non-infectious diseases so they can be treated before progression into later stages, improving cure rates and reducing costs on medical care. (e.g. screening tests for cancer)
<br>Immunisation programme: Prevents disease outbreaks by <a data-href="vaccination" href="biology/immunology/body-defence-mechanisms/specific-defence/responses/vaccination.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">vaccination</a> where individuals are made immune to a disease. If a large majority of population is immunised against a certain disease, the disease will not spread easily.
<br>Health education: Talks, exhibitions and through mass media to raise awareness.

 <br>By the definition of the World Health Organisation (WHO):<br>
"A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease." — Constitution of the World Health Organisation, signed April 7, 1948
<br>The definition dismantles a labelling effect and addresses a common misconception regarding health where people with <a data-href="Diseases" href="biology/immunology/health-and-diseases/diseases.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diseases</a> are labelled as unhealthy, especially those carrying an incurable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Non-infectious diseases" data-href="Non-infectious diseases" href="biology/immunology/health-and-diseases/non-infectious-diseases/non-infectious-diseases.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">chronic diseases</a>.<br>Therefore, there is no "black-and-white" definition of health, but multiple factors that contribute to health. These factors include:<br>
<br>
Physical well-being

<br>Proper body functions
<br>Free from diseases and injuries


<br>
Mental well-being

<br>Ability to cope with stress in life
<br>Ability to work or study productively and realises his or her potential

 <br><br><br>Hypothesis &amp; prediction is formed before an experiment. It helps to form an aim for an experiment to prove.<br>Example:<br>
<br>Cell division resulted in the loss of organic materials, so an organism cannot develop into a complete organism from daughter cells. (HKDSE 2014 Paper 1B Q3)
<br>The hereditary information is stored in the food of the algal cell. (HKDSE 2016 Paper 1B Q8)

<br><br>Dependent variables are the factors that changes according to the independent variable, and is the measurable result.<br>Factors to consider when designing methods of measurement:<br>
<br>Accuracy
<br>Feasibility
<br>Reliability &amp; validity
<br><br><img alt="reliability-validity.webp" src="lib/media/reliability-validity.webp"><br>Definitions:<br>
<br>Reliability is about the consistency of a measurement, and its reproducibility under same conditions.
<br>Validity is about the accuracy of a measurement, whether they can represent what they are trying to measure.
<br>Improving experiment:<br>
<br>Conducting more experiments to minimize individual differences / reduce random errors
<br>Increasing sample size of study
<br>Controlling all other variables (control variables) that can affect the experiment
<br>Taking mean / median of experimental results
<br><br>Control variables are all the other factors that may affect the dependent variables. They are kept constant to ensure the experiment is a fair test.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Temperature, humidity, wind speed
<br>pH of solution
<br>Volume and concentration of mixture
<br>Age, sex and health conditions
<br><br><br>
<br>An experimental set-up is one in which the factor to be studied is present.
<br>A control set-up is one in which the factor to be studied is absent.
<br><br>Definitions:<br>
<br>An assumption is something we think it is true, though we cannot be sure.
<br>A significant assumption is the one that the experiment cannot make any conclusion without assuming it to be true.
<br>Example: Yeast bead catalase investigation<br>
Aim of experiment is to investigate the effect of different types of heavy metal ions on the activity of yeast beads catalase under different concentrations.<br>Unattained:<br>
<br>Environmental conditions are the same.
<br>Yeast beads have the same size and shape.
<br>Basic:<br>
<br>All catalases work the same.
<br>Good:<br>
<br>Amount of catalase in each yeast bead is the same.
<br>Catalase attains the same activity level initially.
<br>Excellent:<br>
<br>Oxygen release by yeast beads is only contributed by activity of catalase but not other enzymes.
<br>The oxygen bubbles released do not dissolve in hydrogen peroxide solution.
<br>Heavy metal ions do not affect the density of the solution which affect the travelling time of the yeast beads moving up to the solution surface.
<br>Respiration of yeast cells does not affect the pH of the solution.
<br><br>Refer to <a data-href="#Reliability &amp; validity" href="about:blank#Reliability_&amp;_validity" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Reliability &amp; validity</a>.<br>Precautions are procedures implemented to obtain valid data / in terms of its effect on the data collected / experimental design.<br>Example:<br>
<br>A leafy shoot should be cut under water to prevent air bubbles from entering the xylem vessels and blocking water uptake. (in potometers)
<br>Using reactants of lower concentrations to ensure the measurement can be conducted in time / within allowed gradations.
<br><br>Limitations are the practical or theoretical shortcomings of a study that are often outside of the researcher's control.<br>Example:<br>
<br>A potometer can only measure the rate of water uptake.
<br>Some parts of beetroot tissue have more pigment in their cells than others. (beetroot experiment)
<br>The reactants may not be identical in&nbsp;size&nbsp;and shape, meaning some test tubes could contain slightly more reactants than others.

<br>Upper and lower jaws contain sockets that hold the teeth in place.
<br><br>The vertebral column consists of 33 vertebrae.<br><img alt="vertebral_column.webp" src="lib/media/vertebral_column.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Functions of the vertebral column:<br>
<br>Supports the weight of the upper part of the body.
<br>Provides surfaces for muscle attachment to maintain posture and allow movement.
<br>Encloses and protects the spinal cord.
<br>There are pieces of cartilage called intervertebral discs between the vertebrae. They can be compressed and allows the vertebral column to bend. This helps absorb shock and prevent wearing of the vertebrae during movement.<br><br>The rib cage is formed by ribs, the sternum and part of the vertebral column. It protects the heart and the lungs, and is involved in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Lungs and associated structures" data-href="Lungs and associated structures" href="biology/anatomy/gas-exchange/structures/lungs-and-associated-structures.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">breathing</a>.<br><img alt="rib_cage.webp" src="lib/media/rib_cage.webp"><br>There are twelve pairs of ribs in a rib cage, all of which are connected to the vertebrae.<br>
<br>The first ten pairs are connected to the sternum by a cartilage.
<br>The other two pairs are not connected to the sternum. They are referred to as the floating ribs.
<br><br>The appendicular skeleton is the skeleton lying on either side of the body.<br><img alt="appendicular_skeleton.webp" src="lib/media/appendicular_skeleton.webp" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Components:<br>
<br>
Limb bones: Bones of the two arms and the two legs.

<br>
Limb girdles: Provide a connection between the limbs and the axial skeleton.
Limb girdles in the human body:

<br>
Pectoral girdle: Forms the shoulders and attaches the arms to the axial skeleton.

<br>
Pelvic girdle: Forms the hips and attaches the legs to the axial skeleton.

<br>It is usually wider in female than that of a male to allow the fetus to pass out more easily during birth.
<br>It protects the urinary bladder and part of the reproductive system.


<br><br><br><img alt="bones.webp" src="lib/media/bones.webp" style="width: 650px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Composition:<br>
<br>Organic materials: Living cells and proteins (e.g. collagen)

<br>They provide flexibility and a certain degree of elasticity to the bones.


<br>Inorganic materials: Minerals, mainly calcium phosphate and some calcium carbonate

<br>They make the bones hard.


<br>Types of bone tissues:<br>
<br>Compact bone: Dense bone that makes up the outer part of all bones and most of the shaft of long bones.

<br>It provides strength for weight bearing.


<br>Spongy bone: Found at the ends of long bones and contains many small cavities (porous).

<br>It adds strength to the bone with the minimum of weight.


<br>Kinds of bone marrow:<br>
<br>Red bone marrow: Fills the cavities of spongy bones.

<br>It is the site of formation of blood cells.


<br>Yellow bone marrow: Fills the central cavity in the shaft of long bones.

<br>It contains stored fat.


<br>Functions of blood vessels and nerves:<br>
<br>Blood vessels run through the bone tissue to supply nutrients and oxygen to the bone cells and remove waste from them.
<br>Nerves allow for the detection of pain (for protection).
<br><br><img alt="cartilage.webp" src="lib/media/cartilage.webp" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Cartilage is made up of living cells.<br>
<br>Softer and less rigid than bones because it contains fewer minerals.
<br>More elastic than bones due to higher content of collagen.
<br>Functions:<br>
<br>Some cartilage cover the end surfaces of bones. They act as shock absorber, reduces friction between the bones during movement and prevents wearing of bones at the joints.
<br>Some are found in various structures (e.g. pinna, trachea, epiglottis). This helps it maintain shape and provides support.
<br>Growth and repair:<br>
Cartilage can grow and repair themselves because they are living tissues. However, it repairs more slowly than other tissues since cartilage does not have any blood vessels and nerves.<br><br><br>
<br>It provides a rigid framework to support the body weight and hold the body upright.
<br>It gives definite shapes to different parts of the body.
<br><br>
<br>It provides surfaces for attachment of skeletal muscles, and works with skeletal muscles to allow movement of the body.
<br><br>
<br>The skull protects the brain, the eyeballs and the ears.
<br>The vertebral column protects the spinal cord.
<br>The rib cage protects the heart and the lungs.
<br>The pelvic girdle protects the urinary bladder and parts of the reproductive system.
<br><br>
<br>Bones store minerals (e.g. calcium and phosphate).
<br>Yellow bone marrow stores fat.
<br><br>
<br>Many bones contain red bone marrow that produces red blood cells, white blood cells and blood platelets.

<br>Immovable joints (e.g. joints between the bones of the cranium)
<br><br><img alt="movable_joint.webp" src="lib/media/movable_joint.webp" style="width: 450px; max-width: 100%;"><br>A movable joint is held together by tough and elastic ligaments that forms the fibrous capsule enclosing the joint.<br>
<br>The end surfaces of the bone are covered with cartilage.
<br>The inner surface of the fibrous capsule is lined by a synovial membrane that secretes synovial fluid into the synovial cavity.
<br>Functions of ligaments:<br>
<br>Allow the bones to move (→ Elastic)
<br>Hold the bones in position (→ Tough)
<br>Prevent dislocation of the joint during movement (→ Tough)
<br>Functions of cartilage:<br>
<br>Acts as a shock absorber.
<br>Reduces friction between the bones during movement.
<br>Prevents wearing of bones at the joints during movement.
<br>Functions of synovial fluid:<br>
<br>Serves as a lubricant to reduce friction between the bones during movement.
<br>Supplies oxygen and nutrients to the cartilage.
<br><br><br><br>The convex surfaces of one bone fits into the concave surface of another bone.

 <br><img alt="skeletal_muscles.webp" src="lib/media/skeletal_muscles.webp"><br>Skeletal muscles, also striated muscles, are made up of bundles of muscle fibres surrounded by connective tissues. Each muscle fibre is a singe, elongated muscle cell that contains a number of nuclei. They are attached to bones by tough and inelastic tendons made up of collagen fibres.<br>Skeletal muscles appear to have striations of light bands and dark bands when viewed with a microscope. This is why they are also called striated muscles.<br><br>
<br>Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles because their contractions can be consciously controlled by the cerebrum.
<br>Skeletal muscles contract quickly but also fatigue quickly.

<br><img alt="sarcomere.webp" src="lib/media/sarcomere.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>Skeletal muscles are attached to bones by tendons, with one end that does not move, and another end that moves when the muscles contract.<br><img alt="transmission_pulling_force.webp" src="lib/media/transmission_pulling_force.webp" style="width: 450px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Tendons are tough and inelastic. They can effectively transmit the pulling force from muscles to bones.<br><br>Skeletal muscles usually work in pairs as opposing muscles to move bones in opposite directions.<br>One muscle contracts to pull a bone into one position, while another muscle contracts to return the bone to its original position. Pairs of muscles working in this manner are called opposing muscles or antagonistic muscles.<br>
<br>A flexor bends a limb at a joint when it contracts.
<br>An extensor straightens the same limb at a joint when it contracts.

In the above example, the biceps is a flexor, while the triceps is an extensor.<br>Naming of muscles:<br>
<br>When a flexor contracts, the opposing extensor is relaxed to allow the limb to bend.
<br>When a extensor contracts, the opposing flexor is relaxed to allow the limb to straighten.

<br>At a neuromuscular junction, the membrane of the muscle fibre becomes highly folded to form a motor end plate. This provides a large surface area for the neurotransmitters to bind to its receptor sites.
<br>Since motor neurones form neuromuscular junctions with a number of muscle fibres, many muscle fibres can contract at the same time, generating a great pulling force.

<br>Nerve fibres: Cytoplasmic processes (extensions) extending from the cell body.

<br>Dendons transmit nerve impulses towards the cell body.<br>
They can form branches called dendrites to receive information from a number of neurones.
<br>Axons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body.


<br><br>
<br>
A neurone has long nerve fibres.<br>
This is to transmit nerve impulses over a long distance.

<br>
A dendron has many branches (dendrites).<br>
This is to receive information from other neurones so that each neurone can communicate with many others.

<br>
Most nerve fibres are surrounded by a lipid covering called the myelin sheath.<br>
This is to protect and insulate the nerve fibres, so that the loss of nerve impulses to the surroundings can be prevented. It can also speed up the transmission of nerve impulses.

<br>Tip
Nerve fibres surrounded by the myelin sheath is referred to as myelinated.
<br><br><img alt="neurones_type.webp" src="lib/media/neurones_type.webp"><br>
<br>
Sensory neurones<br>
They transmit nerve impulses from receptors to the CNS.<br>
They have an oval-shaped cell body lying outside the CNS, with a long dendron and a short axon.

<br>
Motor neurones<br>
They transmit nerve impulses from the CNS to effectors (e.g. muscles and glands).<br>
They have an irregularly shaped cell body lying outside the CNS, with a number of very short dendrons and long axons.

<br>
Interneurones<br>
They transmit nerve impulses within the CNS.<br>
They have an irregularly shaped cell body lying inside the CNS, with short dendrons and short axons.

<br>A nerve is made up of bundles of nerve fibres wrapped in tough connective tissue.
<br>Some nerves consists of nerve fibres of either sensory or motor neurones only.<br>
(e.g. optic nerve is a cranial nerve consisting of nerve fibres of sensory neurones only)
<br>However, spinal nerves consist of nerve fibres of both sensory and motor neurones.
<br><br>A synapse is the junction between two neurones. Transmission of nerve impulses from one neurone to another is done by means of neurotransmitters.<br><img alt="synapse_transmission.webp" src="lib/media/synapse_transmission.webp"><br>
<br>Synaptic knob: Swollen structure located at the end of an axon, with numerous <a data-href="mitochondria" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/mitochondria.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mitochondria</a> for energy production and contains synaptic vesicles to store neurotransmitters.
<br>Synaptic cleft: Tiny gap that separates the neurones. There are also <a data-href="enzymes" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/enzymes/enzymes.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">enzymes</a> present in the synaptic cleft to break down neurotransmitters.
<br>Note

<br>There is no physical contact between neurones, nerve impulses cannot travel directly to the next neurone.
<br>The enzymes in the synaptic cleft is specific in action to prevent repeated nerve impulses from being generated when the dendron is continuously stimulated.

<br><br>
<br>
Unidirectional transmission of nerve impulses

<br>Description: Synapses ensure that nerve impulses are transmitted in one direction only (from axon of one neurone to dendron of the next neurone).
<br>Explanation: Only synaptic knobs can secrete neurotransmitters and only dendrons have receptor sites for binding with neurotransmitters.


<br>
Formation of neural networks<br>
Synapses allow one neurone to communicate with many other neurones to form neural networks. This allows complex coordination between receptors and effectors.

 <br>Reflex actions are rapid automatic responses to a stimulus, allowing the body to respond quickly and protect us from danger.<br>Characteristics:<br>
<br>Stereotyped: Same stimulus always lead to the same response.
<br>Involuntary: They are not under the control of the cerebrum.
<br>Inborn &amp; No prior learning is required.
<br><br>In humans, both the medulla oblongata and spinal cord serve as reflex centres.<br>
<br>Medulla: Sneezing, coughing, saliva secretion, swallowing, etc.
<br>Spinal cord: Spinal reflexes, withdrawal reflex, knee jerk reflex
<br>A reflex action involves a reflex arc, the nervous pathway along which nerve impulses travel for the reflex action to take place.<br>Components:<br>
<br>A receptor
<br>A sensory neurone
<br>An interneurone (may be absent)
<br>A motor neurone
<br>An effector
<br><br><br>The withdrawal reflex is an automatic response to withdraw a limb from a painful stimulus, protecting us from being injured (when touching a hot or sharp object accidentally with a hand).<br><img alt="withdrawal_reflex.webp" src="lib/media/withdrawal_reflex.webp"><br>Note
The receptor is linked to the effector by only three neurones: sensory neurone, interneurone and motor neurone. Nerve impulses can travel through the reflex arc very quickly (in &lt; 0.1 s).
<br>
<br>
Sensation of pain<br>
The cerebrum receives information from the sensory neurone through another interneurone not part of the reflex arc. Sensation of pain is felt after the hand has been withdrawn as the nerve impulse takes longer to travel to the cerebrum.

<br>
Overcoming reflex action<br>
The reflex action can be overcome voluntarily via another interneurone of another nervous pathway that forms a synapse with the motor neurone, which allows the cerebrum to transmit nerve impulses from the cerebrum to initiate voluntary movement of the arm.

<br><br>When the tendon just below the knee cap is tapped, a hanging leg will give a little kick automatically. This helps maintain body posture and balance during walking.<br><img alt="knee_jerk_reflex.webp" src="lib/media/knee_jerk_reflex.webp"><br>Note
The receptor is linked to the effector by only two neurones: a sensory neurone and a motor neurone.
<br>
<br>Sensation of tapping<br>
An interneurone of another nervous pathway forms a synapse with the sensory neurone in the reflex arc, nerve impulses are transmitted to the cerebrum.

<br>Do not take place automatically and are not stereotyped
<br>Can take place without stimulation of receptors, but caused by nerve impulses generated in the cerebrum

<br>Receptors detect a stimulus and generate nerve impulses.
<br>The nerve impulses are transmitted along the sensory neurones to the sensory areas of the cerebrum.
<br>The association areas of the cerebrum integrate nerve impulses from different receptors or sensory areas and relate them to past experiences. When a decision is made, nerve impulses are generated and transmitted to the motor areas.
<br>The motor areas of the cerebrum generate and send nerve impulses along motor neurones to effectors.
<br>The effectors produce responses.

 <br><br>Nervous system is responsible for nervous coordination.<br>Parts of the nervous system:<br>
<br>
Central nervous system (CNS)<br>
Consists of the brain and spinal cord, and receives sensory signals in the form of nerve impulses from receptors in different parts of the body, then interprets the nerve impulses and initiating responses.

<br>
Peripheral nervous system (PNS)<br>
Consists of nerves outside the CNS, and named from where they arise:

<br>Cranial nerves: (e.g. optic nerves and auditory nerves)<br>
Arise from the brain, linking the brain with receptors and effectors in the head and the neck.
<br>Spinal nerves:<br>
Arise from the spinal cord, linking the spinal cord with receptors and effectors in the rest of the body.

<br><br>Endocrine system is responsible for hormonal coordination, consisting of a number of endocrine glands secreting hormones to coordinate many physiological processes in the body.<br><br>Endocrine glands<br><br><br>
<br>Growth hormone (GH): Stimulates growth of skeletal muscles and bones.
<br>Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH): Regulates the water content of the blood.
<br>Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH): Stimulates ovum development and oestrogen secretion in females.
<br>Luteinising hormone (LH): Stimulates ovulation in females.

<br><br>
<br>Testosterone: Stimulates the development of the male reproductive system and male secondary sexual characteristics.
<br><br>Hormones are chemical messengers that travel throughout the body in the bloodstream. They have the following properties:<br>
<br>They are very specific and will only act on target organs with cells that have specific receptor sites.

<br>The hormone binds to the receptor sites of the target cells to produce specific responses.
<br>Cells that lack receptor sites do not respond to the hormone.


<br>They are effective in very low concentrations, but can have widespread and long-lasting effects.

<br>The hormone may affect multiple organs situated far away from the gland that produce it.

<br>Tidal volume is the volume of air that moved through the lungs in each inhalation and exhalation during resting.
<br>Only the cycles where there are no major fluctuations should be measured in the breathing rate.
<br>A spirometer is used to determine the vital capacity of a person.

<br>
Initiation of inhalation<br>
Respiratory centre sends nerve impulses to the intercostal muscles and diaphragm muscle to stimulate them to contract, and the lung inflate and inhalation occurs.

<br>
Stimulation of stretch receptors<br>
Stretch receptors send nerve impulses to inhibit the respiratory centre, so it stops sending nerve impulses to the respiratory muscles. The muscles would relax, and the lung to deflate and exhalation occurs.

<br><br>The rate and depth of breathing is affected by the concentration of carbon dioxide in blood. Chemoreceptors detect changes in pH of the blood and send nerve impulses to the respiratory centre. It is controlled by a <a data-href="negative feedback mechanism" href="biology/neuroscience/homeostasis/negative-feedback-mechanism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">negative feedback mechanism</a>.<br>Detection by chemoreceptors
Respiration consumes  and produces  simultaneously, so the rate of consumption of  is directly proportional to the rate of production of .

<br>The heart is composed mainly of cardiac muscles. They can contract upon stimulation by electrical impulses generated by the cardiac muscles themselves.
<br>The sinoatrial (SA) node (group of specialized cardiac muscle cells) is a "pacemaker" that provides the initial stimulus for a heartbeat.
<br>Process:<br>
<br>
Electrical impulse generation by SA node &amp; Contraction of atria

<br>Electrical impulse is generated by the SA node, which spreads rapidly through the walls of both atria, causing both atria to contract at the same time.


<br>
Electrical impulse relay at AV node

<br>The electrical impulse pass to the AV node (a relay point) between the right atrium and the right ventricle.
<br>AV node relays the electrical impulses along the septum to the base of the ventricles through the bundle of His (specialized muscle fibres).
<br>The electrical impulses are delayed for ~0.1 second to allow time for the ventricles to fill with blood.


<br>
Contraction of ventricles

<br>As the electrical impulses spread upwards through the wall of the ventricles, the ventricles contract from the bottom up to squeeze blood upwards into the aorta and pulmonary arteries.


<br>Note
The inner walls of the ventricles contain specialized conducting fibres which spread the electrical impulses.
<br><br>A cardiac cycle is a sequence of events starting from one contraction of the atria to the next.<br>Note
The human heart beats 72 times per minute on average, with each cardiac cycle lasting ~0.8 seconds.
<br>
<br>
Atrial systole (contraction of the atria)<br>
()

<br>SA node generates electrical impulses.
<br>Atria contract and ventricles relax.
<br>Blood pressure in atria becomes higher than that in the ventricles.
<br>Bicuspid and tricuspid valves open. Blood is forced from the atria into the ventricles through bicuspid and tricuspid valves.


<br>
Ventricular systole (contraction of the ventricles)<br>
()

<br>AV node relays electrical impulses.
<br>Ventricles contract and atria relax.
<br>Blood pressure in ventricles becomes higher than that in the atria.
<br>Bicuspid and tricuspid valves are forced to close. This prevents the backflow of blood into the atria.
<br>Semilunar valves open. Blood is forced into the aorta and the pulmonary artery through the semilunar valves.


<br>Note
The closure of bicuspid and tricuspid valves produces the first heart sound ('lub').
<br>
<br>Diastole (relaxation)<br>
()

<br>Both the ventricles and atria relax.
<br>Blood pressure in ventricles and atria fall. The blood pressure in atria is higher than that in ventricles.
<br>Bicuspid and tricuspid valves open. Blood from the vena cava and pulmonary vein is allowed to flow into the atria. (as the pressure in the atria is lower)
<br>Semilunar valves close. This prevents the backflow of blood from the two blood vessels into the ventricles.


<br>Note
The closure of semilunar valves process produces the second heart sound ('dub').
<br><br>Cardiac output is the total volume of blood pumped by each ventricle per minute.<br><br>
<br>Heart rate: Numbers of heartbeats per minute
<br>Stroke volume: Volume of blood pumped by each ventricle in one heartbeat
<br>Factors affecting stroke volume:<br>
<br>
Venous return (volume of blood returning to the heart from the vena cava)<br>
It limits the volume of blood available in the left ventricle.

<br>
Strength of ventricular contraction<br>
It determines the maximum volume of blood pumped out of the heart in each heartbeat.<br>
↪️ See also: HKDSE 2014 Paper 2 Q1(b)(ii)

<br><br>Factors influencing control of cardiac output:<br>
<br>
Blood pH (concentration of  in blood)<br>
Changes in blood (/ cerebrospinal fluid) pH are detected by chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies which send nerve impulses to the cardiovascular centre.

<br>
Blood pressure<br>
Stretch receptors in the walls of vena cava, carotid arteries and the aorta are sensitive to stretching of blood vessels caused by increased blood flow.

<br>
Movement of limbs<br>
This stimulates stretch receptors in muscles and tendons.

<br>Mechanism of control:<br>
<br>Receptors send nerve impulses to the cardiovascular centre in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Central nervous system > Medulla oblongata (Medulla)" data-href="Central nervous system#Medulla oblongata (Medulla)" href="biology/neuroscience/coordination/nervous-system/central-nervous-system.html#Medulla_oblongata_(Medulla)" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">medulla oblongata</a>.
<br>Cardiovascular centre processes the information and send nerve impulses to SA node via a sympathetic nerve and the vagus nerve (parasympathetic nerve) to regulate cardiac output.

<br>These nerves are antagonistic in action: sympathetic nerve stimulates the SA node, increasing cardiac output; vagus nerve inhibits SA node, decreasing cardiac output.
<br>When resting, vagus nerve is more active than the sympathetic nerve.<br>
During exercise or in stressful situations, sympathetic nerve will be more active.


<br>Control by cardiovascular centre:<br>
<br>When more nerve impulses is sent via the sympathetic nerve to stimulate the SA node and the cardiac muscle:

<br>The cardiac muscle contracts more frequently and forcefully.
<br>The heart rate and stroke volume is increased.
<br>Cardiac output is increased.


<br>When less nerve impulses is sent via the sympathetic nerve to stimulate the SA node and the cardiac muscle:

<br>The cardiac muscle contracts less frequently and forcefully.
<br>The heart rate and stroke volume is decreased.
<br>Cardiac output is decreased.


<br>Note
When more nerve impulses are sent through the vagus nerve, fewer nerve impulses (but not none) are sent through the sympathetic nerve.
<br><br>During exercise or in stressful situations, the cardiovascular centre sends nerve impulses via the sympathetic nerve to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Endocrine system" data-href="Endocrine system" href="Endocrine system" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">adrenal glands</a>, causing them to secrete more adrenaline into the blood.<br>Action of adrenaline:<br>

<br>Skeletal muscles contract more vigorously.
<br>Energy demand is increased.
<br>More oxygen is needed to carry out <a data-href="aerobic respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/aerobic-respiration/aerobic-respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">aerobic respiration</a> at a faster rate.
<br>Carbon dioxide is produced at a faster rate.
<br><br>Response to exercise:<br>
<br>Respiratory centre (in the medulla) is stimulated to send more nerve impulses through the sympathetic nerve to the respiratory muscles to increase ventilation rate.
<br>More oxygen can be breathed in per unit time, oxygen concentration in air sacs increases. A steep concentration gradient of oxygen between the air inside the air sacs and the blood in the capillaries can be maintained so oxygen diffuses into the blood more rapidly.
<br>Carbon dioxide can also be breathed out more quickly, thus a steep concentration gradient of carbon dioxide between the blood and air sacs is maintained for the rapid removal of carbon dioxide by <a data-href="diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusion</a>.
<br>Response to strenuous exercises:<br>
<br>As the intensity of physical activity increases, the energy demand of muscle cells increases greatly. The rate of <a data-href="Aerobic respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/aerobic-respiration/aerobic-respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Aerobic respiration</a> is limited by the availability of oxygen and may not be fast enough to provide sufficient energy to satisfy the energy demand.
<br>Skeletal muscles cells would also undergo <a data-href="Anaerobic respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/anaerobic-respiration/anaerobic-respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anaerobic respiration</a> to produce extra energy to supply the immediate energy need. Lactic acid is produced as a by-product, accumulation of the acid in skeletal muscles gradually prevents the muscles from contracting normally and they begin to work inefficiently (muscle fatigue).
<br><br>
<br>Ventilation rate remains high for some time after exercise ends, gas exchange occurs at a faster rate.
<br>This provides more oxygen for the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Lactate fermentation" data-href="Lactate fermentation" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/anaerobic-respiration/lactate-fermentation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">metabolism of lactic acid</a> in the liver (to pay the oxygen debt) so that the blood pH can be increased to a normal level.

<br>
Supply oxygen and glucose to skeletal muscle cells more rapidly.<br>

<br>
Remove carbon dioxide and lactic acid from skeletal muscle cells more rapidly.<br>
This prevents the accumulation of carbon dioxide and lactic acid in the muscles, which lowers the pH of the blood and affects enzymatic reactions.

<br>
Remove heat from skeletal muscles and cardiac muscle.<br>
This prevents muscles from overheating.

<br>Actions to increase cardiac output:<br>
<br>Cardiovascular centre is stimulated and sends more nerve impulses to the SA node and the cardiac muscles via the sympathetic nerve.
<br>The cardiac muscles contract more frequently and forcefully.
<br>Adrenal glands secrete more adrenaline into the blood and increases cardiac output.

<br>In the hypothalamus: Detect the temperature of the blood
<br>In the skin: Detect the temperature of the skin
<br><br>The control centre is the thermoregulatory centre in the hypothalamus of the brain.<br>
<br>Monitors and controls the core body temperature.
<br>Receives nerve impulses from receptors about temperature changes.
<br>Tip
Core body temperature refers to the temperature of the brain and organs in the thorax and abdomen.
<br>Division by functionality:<br>
<br>Heat gain centre: Stimulated when temperature is lower than normal and coordinates effectors to initiate responses that increase heat gain and reduce heat loss.
<br>Heat loss centre: Stimulated when temperature is higher than normal and coordinates effectors to initiate responses that reduce heat gain and increase heat loss.
<br><br>
<br>Arterioles near the skin surface (for vasoconstriction)
<br>Sweat glands (for sweating)
<br>Erector muscles (for reducing heat loss by contraction)
<br>Skeletal muscles (for shivering to generate heat)
<br>Thyroid gland (controls metabolic rate)
<br><br>Initiation of response:<br>
<br>Body temperature becomes lower / higher than normal as it loses heat more quickly to the surroundings.
<br>The heat gain / loss centre in the hypothalamus is stimulated to send nerve impulses to initiate responses in the skin that reduce / increase heat loss.
<br>Responses to reduce heat loss:<br>
<br>Vasoconstriction of arterioles reduces blood flow to capillaries near the skin surface. More blood flows through the shunt vessel (which is deeper in the skin). Less heat is loss from the skin to surroundings by conduction, convection and radiation.
<br>Sweat glands secrete less sweat, and heat loss by evaporation is reduced.
<br>Erector muscles contract and hairs become erect.
<br>In the long term, the layer of subcutaneous fat becomes thicker in cold conditions. Fat is a good insulator of heat, less heat is lost from the body by conduction and convection.
<br>Responses to increase heat loss:<br>
<br>Vasodilation of arterioles increases blood flow to capillaries near the skin surface. More heat is loss from the skin to surroundings by conduction, convection and radiation.
<br>Sweat glands secrete more sweat, heat loss by evaporation is increased.
<br>Erector muscles relax and hairs lie flat.
<br>In the long term, the layer of subcutaneous fat becomes thinner in hot conditions. This reduces the insulating effect.

<br>Like <a data-href="transpiration" href="biology/botany/processes/transpiration/transpiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">transpiration</a>, wind speed and relative humidity affects the rate of evaporation of sweat.
<br>A layer of still air is trapped close to the skin surface for mammals with thick furs. Since air is a good insulator of heat, so heat loss from the skin by conduction and convection is prevented.

 <br>Dialysis machines are used in patients with kidney failures to perform haemodialysis, which can remove wastes and excess salts from the blood.<br><img alt="dialysis_machine.webp" src="lib/media/dialysis_machine.webp"><br><br>
<br>
Dialysis tubing is differentially permeable.<br>
It has small pores that allow small molecules to pass through, but blood cells and plasma proteins cannot.

<br>
Composition of the dialysis fluid is similar to that of blood plasma.

<br>It has the same concentration of glucose, amino acids and salts as normal blood, so there is no net flow of essential substances from the blood to the dialysis fluid in order to prevent the loss of essential substances.
<br>The water potential is the same as blood to prevent water loss.
<br>The dialysis fluid is kept at the same temperature as blood (37°C) to prevent heat loss.
<br>However, it does not contain urea to allow urea to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Diffusion" data-href="Diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffuse</a> into the dialysis fluid down the concentration gradient.


<br>
Dialysis tubing is highly branched. (similar to a capillary network)<br>
This increases the surface area for rapid <a data-href="diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusion</a> of urea out of the blood.

<br>
Dialysis fluid and blood flow in opposite directions.<br>
This ensures there will be a difference in concentration in the whole length of the dialysis tubing, this maintains a steep concentration gradient for rapid <a data-href="diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusion</a>, and ensures more urea is removed.

<br><br>
<br>The amount of blood that can be drawn into the dialysis machine per unit time is limited, each treatment may take 4-6 hours to remove most urea from blood.
<br>The treatment has to be repeated 2-3 times a week as urea is continuously produced by the liver.

 <br>Osmoregulation is the regulation of water content in the body.<br>Goals of osmoregulation:<br>
<br>Keeping the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Osmosis" data-href="Osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">water potential</a> of the blood and tissue fluid constant (water balance)
<br>Maintaining a stable environment for cells to function properly<br>
↪️ Achieved by actively retaining or releasing water in urine
<br><br>Osmoregulation is controlled by a <a data-href="negative feedback mechanism" href="biology/neuroscience/homeostasis/negative-feedback-mechanism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">negative feedback mechanism</a>. This involves urine production, which is brought about by antidiuretic hormone (ADH).<br>Details of antidiuretic hormone (ADH):<br>
<br>Production: Produced by the hypothalamus of the brain continuously.
<br>Release: Stored and released by the pituitary gland. Amount of ADH released depends on the changes in water potential of blood detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus.
<br>Effects: Increases the permeability of the walls of the collecting duct so that a proportion of water is reabsorbed.
<br>Goal: Conserve water / Remove excess water
<br><br>
<br>Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect a fall in water potential in blood, and signals the pituitary gland to release more ADH.
<br>The level of ADH in blood increases.

<br>The walls of the collecting ducts become more permeable to water.
<br>A larger proportion of water is reabsorbed into the blood by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a>.
<br>A smaller volume of concentrated urine is formed.


<br>The hypothalamus stimulates the 'thirst centre' in the brain, so the person feel thirsty and drink water.
<br>The water potential of blood rises and returns to normal.
<br><br>
<br>Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect a rise in water potential in blood, and signals the pituitary gland to release less ADH.
<br>The level of ADH in blood decreases.

<br>The walls of the collecting ducts become less permeable to water.
<br>A smaller proportion of water is reabsorbed into the blood by <a data-href="Osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Osmosis</a>.
<br>A larger volume of dilute urine is formed.


<br>The water potential of blood falls and returns to normal.
<br><br>Processes for water gain and loss

<br>Water gain: drinks, food, metabolism (e.g. respiration)
<br>Water loss: exhaled air, sweat, urine, faeces

<br><br>Factors:<br>
<br>Direct gain/loss of water
<br>Production of metabolic wastes (e.g. urea) during <a data-href="respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">respiration</a>
<br>Glucose level (e.g. absorption, <a data-href="diabetes mellitus" href="biology/immunology/health-and-diseases/non-infectious-diseases/diabetes-mellitus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diabetes mellitus</a>)
<br>Intake of minerals
<br>Note
As part of osmoregulation, small and soluble substances in blood are also <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Ultrafiltration" data-href="Ultrafiltration" href="biology/neuroscience/physiology/water-content-regulation/ultrafiltration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">filtered</a> and end up in the urine produced. This helps to achieve the salt and water balance of the body.
<br>Effects:<br>
<br>
Regulation by ADH<br>
Secretion of ADH is increased/decreased in order to retain/release a larger amount of water in blood.

<br>
Increased blood volume<br>
When the water potential of the cells is higher than that of blood, there will be a net movement of water from body cells to blood by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a>.

<br><br>Consider two types of drinks: distilled water, mineralized water<br>
<br>All drinks increases the volume of blood.
<br>Distilled water increases the water potential of blood, this decreases the secretion of ADH to release water.

<br>A larger volume of dilute urine is produced when taking in distilled water, and therefore it is less effective in replenishing water loss / maintaining higher fluid content.


<br>Mineralized water decreases the water potential of blood, this increases the secretion of ADH to retain water, while removing excess salts.

<br>A smaller volume of concentrated urine is produced when taking in mineralized water, and therefore it is more effective in replenishing water loss / maintaining higher fluid content.

 <br>Reabsorption takes place at the kidney tubule. Useful substances are actively absorbed into the blood via capillaries, while water and urea are absorbed passively into blood.<br><br>
<br>
Glucose, amino acids and some salts in the glomerular filtrate are reabsorbed into the blood by both <a data-href="diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusion</a> and <a data-href="active transport" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/active-transport.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">active transport</a>.

<br>
The reabsorption of glucose, amino acids and salts causes the glomerular filtrate to become more dilute and its water potential increases. Water in the filtrate moves into blood by <a data-href="osmosis" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/osmosis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">osmosis</a> down a water potential gradient.

<br>Amount of water reabsorbed is directly proportional to the amount of solutes reabsorbed. Therefore, the concentration of the filtrate that arrives at the end of the first coiled tubule remains unchanged.


<br>
Reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate raises the concentration of urea (to become higher than in blood) along the tubule, resulting in passive reabsorption of urea into blood by <a data-href="diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusion</a>.

<br>Note

<br>Glucose and amino acids are soluble in water, as they can form extensive <a data-href="hydrogen bonds" href="chemistry/structures-and-patterns-in-chemicals/structure-and-bondings/simple-molecules/intermolecular-forces/hydrogen-bonds.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">hydrogen bonds</a> with water molecules.
<br>Glucose and amino acids are completely (and only) reabsorbed in the first coiled tubule. Water, urea, and some salts are reabsorbed even in the collecting duct.
<br>For sodium ions, they are always actively reabsorbed. Their presence in blood can affect the water potential of blood.

<br><br>
<br>The first coiled tubule is long and highly coiled, increasing surface area and allowing more time for reabsorption.
<br>The inner wall of first coiled tubule is lined with microvilli, increasing surface area for reabsorption.
<br>The wall of first coiled tubule is only one-cell thick, and the tubules are close in contact with blood capillaries, shortening the distance for reabsorption.
<br>The cells in the walls of first coiled tubule contain numerous <a data-href="mitochondria" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/mitochondria.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mitochondria</a>, providing a lot of energy for <a data-href="active transport" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/active-transport.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">active transport</a> of useful substances against a concentration gradient.
<br>Each kidney tubule is richly supplied with blood capillaries, a steep concentration gradient can be maintained for rapid absorption of substances.
<br>Tip
The kidneys contain over a million nephrons, this makes the kidneys highly effective in filtering blood and reabsorption.

 <br>Ultrafiltration takes place in the glomerulus.<br><img alt="photomicro_blood_vessels.webp" src="lib/media/photomicro_blood_vessels.webp" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Photomicrograph of kidney tissue ⤴️<br><br>
<br>Blood inside the glomerulus is under high blood pressure due to the pumping action of the heart, which results in high hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus.
<br>Capillary wall of the glomerulus and the wall of the Bowman's capsule are thin and differentially permeable. They serve as the filter to allow ultrafiltration.
<br>The glomerulus has a high surface area for <a data-href="diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusion</a> due to its capillary network. This allows efficient filtration of blood by maintainining a steep concentration gradient of substances.
<br>Note
An increase in the blood volume would increase the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus.
<br><br>
<br>
Water and other small molecules in the blood are forced out.<br>
Due to the high hydrostatic pressure inside the glomerulus, they are forced out through the walls of the glomerulus and the Bowman's capsule into the capsular space to form the glomerular filtrate.

<br>
Blood cells and plasma proteins are absent in the glomerular filtrate.<br>
They are too large to pass through the walls of the glomerulus and the Bowman's capsule.

<br>Note

<br>Composition of glomerular filtrate is similar to tissue fluid as they are both formed similarly.
<br>About 20% of blood in the glomerulus is filtered and becomes the glomerular filtrate.

<br>Diseases

<br>Proteinuria — Urine contains excess proteins, usually caused by damaged glomerular capillaries or Bowman's capsule (which acts as filters). As useful proteins are lost, it may cause edema (build-up of fluid in the body's tissue, causing swelling).

 <br>The human eye is a photoreceptor for detecting light. The brain receives the nerve impulses from the eyes and interpret them to produce vision.<br><img alt="eye_surroundings_structure.webp" src="lib/media/eye_surroundings_structure.webp" style="width: 550px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>The eye is a spherical organ situated in an orbit, a bony socket in the skull, which encloses and protects all but the front of the eye.<br>There are three pairs of eye muscles that attach the eyeball to the wall of the orbit. They contract and relax to allow the eyeball to rotate.<br><br>
<br>Eyebrows prevent sweat from entering the eye.
<br>Eyelashes trap dirt before it can enter the eye.
<br>Eyelids can close to protect the eye from foreign objects and strong light.
<br>Tear glands is located above the eyeball and secretes tears.

<br>When we blink, the eyelids spread tears over the eye surface, keeping it moist and clean.
<br>Tears contain an enzyme called lysozyme to kill bacteria.


<br><br><img alt="eyeball_structure.webp" src="lib/media/eyeball_structure.webp" style="width: 550px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>The sclera is the white of the eye.<br>
<br>It is a white, opaque, fibrous coat of the eye, which is very tough so that it gives shape to the eyeball and protects the structures inside.
<br>It is the surface where the eye muscles attach to the eyeball.
<br>The cornea is located in the front part of the eye and is continuous with the sclera.<br>
<br>It is transparent so that light can enter the eye.
<br>It has a curved surface that refracts (bends) light.
<br><br>The choroid contains many blood vessels to supply cells of the retina with nutrients and oxygen, and removes carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes produced.<br>
<br>It is dark in colour because it contains a black pigment to absorb light. This is to prevent reflection of light in the eye and contributes to sharp vision.
<br>The ciliary body is a forward continuation of the choroid.<br>
<br>Ciliary muscles: Ring of circular muscular tissues that surrounds the edge of the lens.
<br>Suspensory ligaments: Connects the ciliary body with the lens and holds it in place.
<br>The lens is a transparent, elastic and biconvex structure that helps refract and focus light onto the retina.<br>
<br>It consists of living cells with no nuclei. This makes them transparent and allows light to pass through without obstruction.
<br>Its elasticity allow the shape of the lens to be changed when looking at objects from different distances.
<br>Note
Ciliary muscles in the ciliary body contract or relax to change the tension of suspensory ligaments, and hence the shape of the lens (thickness, curvature) in order to focus light from objects at different distances onto the retina.

<br>The iris lies in front of the lens and is connected to the ciliary body.<br>
<br>It contains the pigment which gives the eye its colour.
<br>It consists of circular muscles and radial muscles with a central hole called the pupil.
<br>The pair of muscles change the size of the pupil, <a data-href="controlling the amount of light that enters the eye" href="biology/neuroscience/stimuli,-receptors-and-responses/human-eye/controlling-the-amount-of-light-that-enters-the-eye.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">controlling the amount of light that enters the eye</a>.
<br><img alt="iris_pupil.webp" src="lib/media/iris_pupil.webp" style="width: 360px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>The retina contains two types of photoreceptors (light-sensitive cells), which generate nerve impulses when stimulated by light.<br>
<img alt="rod_cone.webp" src="lib/media/rod_cone.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Rod cells are rod-shaped cells that contain the photosensitive pigment visual purple, which is very sensitive to light and stimulated by lower light intensities, allowing it to work well in dim light.<br>
<br>However, it cannot detect colours, they are responsible for black-and-white vision.
<br>They are evenly distributed across the retina, except for their absence from the yellow spot and the blind spot.
<br>Cone cells are cone-shaped cells that are stimulated by higher light intensities and are used mainly in bright light for <a data-href="colour vision" href="biology/neuroscience/stimuli,-receptors-and-responses/human-eye/colour-vision.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">colour vision</a>.<br>
<br>They are less numerous than rod cells — most are concentrated at the yellow spot, but few are found in the periphery of the retina. This is why objects appear most clearly when their image fall on the yellow spot.
<br>The yellow spot is located at the central region of the retina and contains cone cells only. Vision in the centre mainly relies on the detection of light falling on the yellow spot.<br>The blind spot contains no photoreceptors. It is where the optic nerve leaves the eye.<br>The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres with neurones that are connected with photoreceptors on the retina.<br>
<br>When the photoreceptos are stimulated by light, nerve impulses are generated to stimulate the visual centre of the brain. They are transmitted via the optic nerve.
<br>The region where the optic nerve leave the brain is called the blind spot.

<br>
Anterior chamber

<br>Space between the cornea and the lens, filled with aqueous humour, a clear and watery solution secreted by the ciliary body.
<br>Supplies nutrients and oxygen to the cornea and the lens, which have no blood vessels.


<br>
Posterior chamber

<br>Space between the lens and the retina, filled with vitreous humour, a clear and jelly-like fluid secreted by the ciliary body.


<br>↪️ These chambers help keep the shape of the eyeball by maintaining the intraocular pressure and inflates the globe of the eye, and refract and focus light onto the retina.<br><br><img alt="eye_optics.webp" src="lib/media/eye_optics.webp" style="width: 450px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Light rays from the object enter one's eyes through the cornea and are refracted by the cornea, aqueous humour, lens and vitreous humour to be focused on the retina to form a real, vertically and laterally inverted image that is smaller than the object.<br>When photoreceptors on the retina are stimulated by light falling on them, they generate and send nerve impulses along the optic nerve to the visual centre of the brain, which interprets the nerve impulses to produce vision, allowing us to see an upright image of the object.<br>Image formed on the blind spot is not visible because it has no photoreceptors to detect light, no nerve impulses are generated to send to the brain.<br><br><br><img alt="short_sight.webp" src="lib/media/short_sight.webp" style="width: 150px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Short sight is a defect that causes a person see near objects more clearly than distant objects. It occurs when either the eyeball is too long or that the lens is too thick, or a combination of both.<br>Info
People with severe short sight have a higher risk for retinal detachment. This happens as the eyeball continues to lengthen, pulling the retina away from the choroid.
Since retina contains light sensitive cells and obtains nutrients / oxygen from choroid, light sensitive cells will die and light falling on retina cannot be detected, no nerve impulse can be produced. Therefore, vision is impaired.
<br>Effects:<br>
<br>
Light rays from nearby objects focus correctly.<br>
<img alt="short_sight_nearby.webp" src="lib/media/short_sight_nearby.webp" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">

<br>
Light rays from distant objects are focused in front of the retina, resulting in a blurred image on the retina.<br>

<br>If the tip is removed / blocked from light, no bending growth movement occurs.
<br>Bending growth occurs even if the lower part of the coleoptile is covered.
<br>Conclusions:<br>
<br>The tip is responsible for detecting the unilateral light.
<br>Bending growth (response) did not occur in the tip itself but in the region below the tip.
<br>Hypothesis:<br>
A signal is transmitted from the tip to a lower part of the coleoptile to exert the effects of growth.<br><br><img alt="auxins_exp2.webp" src="lib/media/auxins_exp2.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Observations:<br>
<br>Bending growth occurred even when an agar block is inserted.
<br>Growth does not occur when a mica plate is inserted.

<br>A signal is transmitted from the tip by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Diffusion" data-href="Diffusion" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/movement-of-substances/diffusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">diffusing</a> through the agar block to reach the lower part of the coleoptile and exert the effects of growth.
<br>The signal transmitted from the tip to the lower part of the coleoptile is chemical in nature, as the mica plate is impermeable to chemicals and blocked the transmission of signal.

<br>The agar block contained the chemical produced by the tip of the coleoptile.
<br>This chemical stimulated growth as it passed down the decapitated coleoptile.
<br>The decapitated coleoptile bent to one side because of a higher concentration of the growth-promoting chemical on the other side.

 <br>Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts. The substances they act on are referred to as substrates. They are often named by the reactions they catalyse or substrates, and ends with 'ase'.<br><br>To start any chemical reactions, sufficient activation energy must be supplied to the reactants. Enzymes provide a reaction pathway with lower activation energy in order to allow the reaction to occur and/or speed up the reaction. Note that the energy levels of both reactants and products are not changed by the action of enzymes.<br><br><img alt="enzymes_mechanism.webp" src="lib/media/enzymes_mechanism.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Each enzyme has an active site with a specific shape. When the substrate collide with the enzyme and binds to the active site of the enzyme, an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. This allows the reaction to proceed with lower activation energy.<br>Enzymes have specificity to the substrate it can act on. Only substrate with complementary shape can bind to the enzyme to form an enzyme-substrate complex. The 'lock-and-key' model is often used to explain the specificity of enzyme action.<br>The products are released once the reaction has completed, with the enzyme remaining unchanged and free to combine with other substrates.<br><br>
<br>Enzymes are protein molecules and remain active outside the body.

<br>Enzymes are reusable after the reactions and required in small amounts.
<br>Enzymes are highly specific in action, one type of enzyme catalyses only one type of reaction.

Describe an experiment which can compare the different (digestive) amylase activities of wolves and dogs.<br>Note
The word "describe" implies that the process of the experiment should be provided.
<br>Preparation:<br>
Obtain the digestive juice from the mouth (/ intestine / pancreas) of a wolf and a dog.<br>Iodine test:<br>
<br>Method: Mix the digestive juice with excess starch solution.
<br>Test: At regular time intervals, remove a fixed amount of the mixture for <a data-href="iodine test" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/molecules-of-life/iodine-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">iodine test</a> and record the time taken for the mixture to turn from brown to blue-black.
<br>Observation: The shorter the time taken, the faster the digestion of starch, the higher the amylase activity.
<br>Starch agar plate:<br>
<br>Method: Drill two holes on a starch agar plate, add the digestive juices to the holes of starch agar plate respectively.
<br>Test: Incubate the plate for 30 minutes, add iodine solution to the plate and rinse, compare the clear zones appeared.
<br>Observation: The plate that has the bigger clear zone shows more starch digestion, which means a higher amylase activity.
<br>Benedict's test:<br>
<br>Method: Mix the digestive juice with excess starch solution.
<br>Test: Allow 10 minutes for the reaction to take place, then boil the mixture with excess <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Benedict's test" data-href="Benedict's test" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/molecules-of-life/benedict's-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Benedict's solution</a>, and record the amount of red precipitate formed.

 <br><br>
<br>In photosynthesis, the primary product produced is triose phosphate. It can be rapidly synthesized into glucose in leaf cells. Some of the glucose is used to release energy in <a data-href="respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">respiration</a>.
<br>Plants also use glucose to synthesize cellulose, which makes up plant cell walls.
<br><br>

Triose phosphate (3-C sugar) combine in pairs to form glucose (6-C).
<br><br><br>
<br>Glucose not immediately used up in photosynthesis in leaf cells are stored as starch.
<br>Starch is insoluble in water and therefore does not affect the water potential of cells.
<br><br>An iodine test can be performed on a leaf to find out whether it contains starch. The presence of starch indicates that photosynthesis has occurred.<br>
<br>Obtain the leaf from a plant that has been exposed to bright light for several hours.
<br>Put the leaf in a beaker of boiling water for about a minute to break down the cell membrane and allow the iodine solution to enter the cells later. This kills the leaf cells and stops metabolic reactions.
<br>Transfer the leaf into a test tube containing alcohol, then place it in a beaker containing hot water. The alcohol dissolves chlorophyll and allow it to diffuse out of the leaf, decolourizing the leaf.
<br>Remove it from the tube and dip it in hot water for a few second to soften the leaf.
<br>Spread the leaf on a white tile and add a few drops of iodine solution onto it.<br>
<img alt="leaf_iodlne_test.webp" src="lib/media/leaf_iodlne_test.webp" style="width: 240px; max-width: 100%;">
<br>Results:<br>
The iodine solution changes from brown to blue-black. Starch is present in the leaf. This indicates that photosynthesis has occurred.<br><br><br>
<br>Starch is converted to soluble sucrose for export from leaves. It is transported by phloem to various parts of the plant (e.g. buds, fruit, roots, underground storage organs).
<br>The sucrose may be broken down again into glucose for use in respiration, or converted back to starch for storage.

<br><br><img alt="photosynthesis_co2_rateg.webp" src="lib/media/photosynthesis_co2_rateg.webp" style="width: 350px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Since the Earth's atmosphere has a relatively low carbon dioxide concentration of about 0.04%, carbon dioxide concentration usually limits the rate of photosynthesis. An increase in carbon dioxide concentration should increase the rate of photosynthesis, provided that other factors are not limiting.<br>
<br>
At low carbon dioxide concentrations, the rate of photosynthesis increases with an increase in carbon dioxide concentration because more carbon dioxide is available for carbon fixation.

<br>
As the carbon dioxide concentration further increases, the rate of photosynthesis levels off because a factor other than carbon dioxide concentration limits it.

Some of the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

<br>Cut a piece of Hydrilla plant (~10 cm long) under water. Place the plant, with the cut end upwards, in a boiling tube containing dilute sodium hydrogencarbonate solution.
<br>Set up the apparatus. The beaker of water should remain at room temperature. Measure the temperature of the water at intervals throughout the investigation. Renew the water if its temperature becomes too high.
<br>Place the lamp at 0.1 m from the Hydrilla plant and turn the lamp on. Wait for five minutes to allow the plant to equilibrate.
<br>Suck up some solution from the boiling tube into the pipette. Tighten the clip and record the initial liquid level in the pipette.
<br>After 10 minutes, record the liquid level in the pipette again.
<br>Repeat steps 3 to 5 with the lamp placed at different distances (d) from the Hydrilla plant (e.g. 0.2 m, 0.3 m, 0.4 m, 0.5 m).
<br>Calculate the rate of photosynthesis (volume of gas collected per unit time) in different light intensities (∝ 1/d2).
<br>Plot a graph of the rate of photosynthesis against light intensities (See the graph below).
<br>This experimental procedure is also used in <a data-href="Carbon dioxide (Photosynthesis)#Experiment" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/photosynthesis/components/carbon-dioxide-(photosynthesis).html#Experiment" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carbon dioxide (Photosynthesis) &gt; Experiment</a>.<br>
Instead, the concentration of  solution varies.<br>Tip

<br>Dependent variable: Rate of photosynthesis (volume of gas collected per unit time)

<br>
When there is no light, no photosynthesis takes place.

<br>
At low light intensities, the light intensity (a limiting factor) limits the rate of photosynthesis. As the light intensity increases, more energy is supplied to the <a data-href="Photochemical reactions" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/photosynthesis/process/photochemical-reactions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Photochemical reactions</a> and stomata open wider to allow carbon dioxide (a substrate for <a data-href="Carbon fixation" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/photosynthesis/process/carbon-fixation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Carbon fixation</a>) to diffuse into the leaves. Therefore, the rate of photosynthesis increases.

<br>
At a certain light intensity, photosynthesis reaches its maximum rate (saturation point).<br>
The light intensity at the saturation point is called optimum light intensity.

<br>
After the saturation point, further increases in light intensity have no effect on the rate of photosynthesis. Another factor (e.g.  concentration or temperature) now limits the rate of photosynthesis.

<br>Tip

<br>At low to moderate light intensities (before reaching the saturation point), the rate of photosynthesis increases with an increase in light intensity.
<br>When the light intensity has increased to the saturation point, the rate of photosynthesis levels off.
<br>At very high light intensities, chlorophyll molecules may be damaged, and thus reduce the rate of photosynthesis.

<br>
Leave the setup in bright light for at least a day until a quarter of the test tube is filled with gas.

<br>
Remove the test tube carefully and immediately put a glowing splint over the mouth of the test tube to test for oxygen.

<br>Chlorophyll molecule in the thylakoid membrane absorbs light energy, which excites electrons to higher energy levels, leaving the chlorophyll molecule. They then pass through an electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane.
<br>The electron transport chain consists of a series of electron carriers arranged in order of decreasing energy levels. As an electron passes from carriers of higher energy level to lower energy level, energy is released.

Description<br>
Catalysed by the enzyme ATP synthase, some of the energy from electron transport is used to synthesize ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate.

<br>
Meaning of the naming<br>
Phosphorylation: Addition of a phosphate to a molecule<br>
Photo-: Reaction is driven by energy coming from light

<br><br>
<br>
Description<br>
Catalysed by several enzymes, some of the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

<br>
Process<br>
Hydrogen is picked up by a NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) hydrogen acceptor to form NADPH, which is reduced NADP.

<br>
By-product<br>
Oxygen is produced as a by-product of the reaction. It is either used in <a data-href="respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">respiration</a> or released as a gas to the atmosphere.

<br>Light energy is effectively converted to chemical energy stored in organic molecules.
<br><br>
<br>
Sustaining plant life: Photosynthesis provides essential materials for plants.

<br>Glucose: Used in respiration to provide energy for cellular activities. Extra glucose can be converted to starch for storage or synthesized into cellulose for building cell walls.
<br>Other organic nutrients (e.g. proteins, lipids): Can be converted from intermediates of photosynthesis for metabolism and the growth of plants.


<br>
Providing food and maintaining the energy flow in ecosystems

<br>As producers in ecosystems, plant captures light energy from the Sun and converts it to chemical energy stored in their bodies, other organisms depend directly on plants for food and energy.
<br>The stored chemical energy is transferred to consumers and decomposers along a food chain, providing a constant input of energy to maintain the energy flow and sustain life.


<br>
Maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

<br>Respiration and combustion of fossil fuels use oxygen and produce carbon dioxide, lowering atmospheric oxygen levels and increasing carbon dioxide levels.
<br>During photosynthesis, plants take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen, this helps maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

 <br>Glycolysis is the first stage of respiration. It is a process to break down glucose and occurs in the cytoplasm.<br>
<br>It does not require oxygen and can occur in either aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

<br>Overall products (per glucose molecule):<br>
<br>2 pyruvate (3-C)
<br>Net gain of 2 ATP
<br>2 NADH (reduced NAD)
<br>Tip
There are two pyruvate molecules produced per glucose molecule, everything needs to be multiplied by 2 when thinking about what happens to a single glucose molecule in aerobic respiration.

<br>Phosphorylation<br>
Glucose (6-C) is phosphorylated by 2 ATP to form fructose bisphosphate (6-C).<br>
↪️ 
<br>Note
ATP is used to make glucose more reactive (it is usually very stable) and to lower the activation energy of the reaction.
<br>
<br>
Lysis<br>
Fructose bisphosphate (6-C) splits into two molecules of triose phosphate (3-C).<br>
↪️ 

<br>
Oxidation<br>
Hydrogen is removed from each molecule of triose phosphate and transferred to coenzyme NAD to form 2 NADH (reduced NAD).<br>
↪️ 

<br>
Dephosphorylation<br>
Phosphates are transferred from the intermediate substrate molecules to form 4 ATP through substrate-linked phosphorylation.<br>

 <br>Mammalian muscle cells can respire anaerobically when doing strenuous exercise (high-intensity exercise of a short duration. e.g. sprinting and weight lifting), as oxygen may be used up more rapidly than it can be supplied to the muscles.

<br>Mitochondria is a rod-shaped organelle surrounded by a double membrane, where reactions of <a data-href="aerobic respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/aerobic-respiration/aerobic-respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">aerobic respiration</a> take place.<br>
<br>
Outer membrane is differentially permeable.<br>
This allows it to control the movement of molecules into and out of the mitochondria.

<br>
Inner membrane is highly folded, and forms a large number of finger-like projections (cristae).<br>
This provides a large surface area for the attachment of enzymes and carriers involved in <a data-href="aerobic respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/aerobic-respiration/aerobic-respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">aerobic respiration</a>.

<br>
Matrix is the space enclosed by the inner membrane.<br>
It is filled with a fluid and contains enzymes that catalyse the reactions of <a data-href="aerobic respiration" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/respiration/aerobic-respiration/aerobic-respiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">aerobic respiration</a>.

<br>
Outer and inner membranes are separated by a narrow intermembrane space.<br>
This allows molecules to move quickly between the cell cytoplasm and the mitochondrial matrix.

<br>Tip
Mitochondria are the main sites for ATP production. The presence of this organelle depends on the cell's energy usage.
Large quantities of this organelle are present in cells that use a lot of energy (metabolically active cells) (e.g. sperms, liver cells, muscle cells), as they need to synthesize more ATP to support cellular activities.

 <br>Respiration is the process by which the chemical energy stored in food is released. It is also called cellular respiration as it takes place within cells. Glucose is a common substrate used in respiration.<br>Note
Some cells (e.g. brain cells) use glucose as their respiratory substrates, while other cells can use fatty acids, glycerol and amino acids as well.
<br>There are two types of respiration:<br>

<br>Respiration is an oxidative process. It occurs through a series of enzyme-controlled reactions, with some releasing energy or used to synthesize ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Most of the energy (60%) is lost as heat.<br>Word equation for respiration:<br>
<br>Note
Respiration is often compared with burning.

<br>Burning is rapid and uncontrolled. The process is a one-step reaction and releases energy rapidly.
<br>Respiration occurs in small steps and releases energy gradually.

 <br><br>Sex chromosomes are chromosomes that control the inheritance of sex and certain characteristics of the body.<br>
<br>Females have two X chromosomes (), while males have one X chromosomes and one Y chromosomes ().
<br>Certain genes present in sex chromosomes (usually the X chromosome, as it is much larger than the Y chromosome, and thus carries more genes) can cause the inheritance of sex-linked traits.
<br><img alt="karyotype.webp" src="lib/media/karyotype.webp" style="width: 450px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Note
The other 22 pairs of chromosomes are referred to as autosomes.
<br>In meiosis, all ova receive an X chromosome. However, half of the sperms receive an X chromosome and the other half receive a Y chromosome.<br>Since the two types of sperms are produced in equal proportions and fertilization is a random process, there is an equal chance ( or ) of having a boy or a girl at each birth.<br>
<img alt="genetic_diagram2.webp" src="lib/media/genetic_diagram2.webp" style="width: 450px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>Generally, sex-linked inheritances are X-linked and recessive in nature.<br><br>
<br>
Red-green color blindness<br>
X-linked genetic disorder caused by a recessive allele on the X chromosome. Certain cone cells in the retina are absent or defective.

<br>
Haemophilia<br>
Many possible causes. One of which is the deficiency of blood platelets, where people are unable to form blood clots normally (blood coagulation / blood clotting).

<br><br>Key:<br>
: dominant allele for normal color vision<br>
: recessive allele for red-green color blindness<br><br>
<br>Males have only one X chromosome, and if their X chromosome carries the recessive allele, they will suffer from the disorder.<br>
↪️ X-linked recessive inheritance is more common in males than females.

<br><br>Mendel's laws of inheritance was proposed by Gregor Mendel in the 1860s after conducting breeding experiments on pea plants.<br>Pea plants were chosen because:<br>
<br>They had easily observable characteristics.
<br>They grew fast.
<br>They were easy to handle.
<br><br><img alt="monohybrid_cross.webp" src="lib/media/monohybrid_cross.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>Mendel took two pea plants of opposite traits (one short and one tall - homozygous) and crossed them. He found the  generation offspring were tall (homozygous dominant).
<br>Then, he crossed the  filial generation and obtained both tall and short plants in the ratio  (monohybrid ratio) in the  generation.
<br><br><img alt="dihybrid_cross.webp" src="lib/media/dihybrid_cross.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>Mendel crossed wrinkled-green seed and round-yellow seeds and observed that all the  generation were round-yellow (heterozygous). This meant that dominant traits were the round shape and yellow colour.
<br>He then self-pollinated the  generation and obtained 4 different traits: round-yellow, round-green, wrinkled-yellow, and wrinkled-green seeds in the ratio  (dihybrid ratio) in the  generation.
<br><br>Consider the colour of pea flowers, where  represents the dominant allele for red colour,  represents the recessive allele for white colour.<br>To deduce the dominant allele, find a pair of parents with the same phenotype but their offspring has different phenotypes.<br><img alt="deduction_white.webp" src="lib/media/deduction_white.webp" style="width: 280px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Principles for deduction:<br>
<br>The genotype of the the offspring results in the phenotype expressed.
<br>All genes are inherited from the offsprings' parents.
<br>Deduction:<br>
<br>Offspring D is white in colour, so it posses white colour allele.
<br>As the white colour allele is inherited from one of its parents, A or B, either A or B should posses a white colour allele.
<br>However, A and B are all red in colour, that means they all also posses red colour allele.
<br>So either A or B should be heterozygous, and since red colour allele express in this condition, red colour allele is dominant.

<br>Meiotic cell division forms haploid gametes for sexual reproduction.
<br>When a male gamete and female gamete fuse at fertilisation to form a zygote, the diploid number (2n) of chromosome is restored. This keeps the chromosome number of a species constant from generation to generation.


<br>
Genetic variation (speciation)<br>
Meiotic cell division creates very large numbers of genetic variation among the gametes. Some offspring may have characteristics that enable them to survive environmental changes better. This increases the chance of survival of the species.

<br>A DNA molecule consists of two polynucleotide chains (i.e. two DNA strands) that run in opposite directions and are twisted together to form a double helix. (anti-parallel relationship)
<br>The backbone of the DNA molecule is made up of the sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups of nucleotides.
<br>Attached to the sugar of each nucleotide is one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). They can do complementary base pairing.
<br>Genetic information is stored in the sequence of the nucleotide bases in DNA.
<br>Complementary base paring: Bases on one strand pair up with those on the other strand through <a data-href="hydrogen bonds" href="chemistry/structures-and-patterns-in-chemicals/structure-and-bondings/simple-molecules/intermolecular-forces/hydrogen-bonds.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">hydrogen bonds</a>. A always pair up with T, and G always pairs with C.<br>
<br>A-T: 2 hydrogen bonds
<br>G-C: 3 hydrogen bonds
<br><br>
<br>DNA is a large molecule made up of a huge number of nucleotides, it can store a very large amount of genetic information.
<br>DNA molecule is stable.

<br>A gene is a short length of DNA in a chromosome.<br>
<br>The sequence of bases in the DNA of a gene provides the genetic code that determines the sequence of amino acids in a particular polypeptide, making up <a data-href="proteins" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/molecules-of-life/proteins.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">proteins</a> for building body parts, <a data-href="enzymes" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/metabolism-&amp;-enzymes/enzymes/enzymes.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">enzymes</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Endocrine glands" data-href="Endocrine glands" href="biology/neuroscience/coordination/endocrine-system/endocrine-glands.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">hormones</a>.
<br>Genes are the basic unit of heredity and determines traits (body characteristics) of an organism by controlling how proteins are made. Traits may be controlled by one or more genes.
<br><img alt="gene.webp" src="lib/media/gene.webp" style="width: 320px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Tip
The alleles of a gene may differ from each other by only one or a few bases.
<br><br>Locus is the position of a particular gene on a chromosome.<br>Allele is a pair of genes that is located on a locus of two homologous chromosomes. The pair controls one characteristic / trait of an organism.<br>
<br>Homozygous refers to having two identical alleles (e.g. , ).
<br>Heterozygous refers to having two different alleles (e.g. ).
<br>Note
Allele is the alternative form of the gene. However, it only applies to homologous chromosomes.
<br><br>
<br>Genotype is the genetic composition (combination of alleles) of a characteristic (e.g. , , ). It can also be described with nouns.
<br>Phenotype is the observable feature of a characteristic of an organism.
<br>Dominant allele is an allele that can express its effect whether in a homozygous or heteroeygous condition.
<br>Recessive allele is an allele that can express its effect only in a homozygous condition.

<br>Dating of fossil layers:<br>
<br>Radioisotope dating (carbon-14 dating) can be used to arrange fossils in a chronological sequence.
<br><br>
<br>
Fossils show similarities to living species.<br>
This indicate existing life forms arose from pre-existing ones.

<br>
Fossils in younger rocks show a greater diversity of fossils.<br>
This indicate that different types of organisms have evolved from a common ancestor.

<br>
Fossils in younger rocks are more complex than those in older rocks.<br>
This indicate that organisms evolved from simple to complex forms as simple organisms adapted to become more complex.

<br><br>
<br>
There are missing links within the fossil records.<br>
There is a lack of a continuous fossil record of all the intermediate forms between ancient species and modern species.

<br>
Fossils can be damaged and incomplete.<br>
Natural processes (e.g. erosion, movement of Earth's crust) may damage fossils, leaving only incomplete fragments.

<br>
Some organisms may not be fossilized.<br>
Organisms with soft bodies cannot be fossilized, while some other organisms die in conditions not favourable for fossil formation (e.g. dead bodies in rainforests decay rapidly).

<br>
Some fossils are trapped in inaccessible areas.<br>
Fossils can be trapped deep under the sea due to the movement of Earth's crust, making them unavailable for studying.

 <br>Charles Darwin proposed the theory of natural selection and survival of the fittest.<br>
<br>
Individuals compete for limited resources (e.g. food, water and shelter).<br>
Most organisms tend to produce more offspring than needed to replace themselves. However, the number of individuals in a population remains relatively constant.

<br>
There are genetic variations among individuals of the same species. (*)<br>
Individuals with variations favourable to their environment have a greater chance to survive and reproduce. ("survival of the fittest")<br>
↪️ See also: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Variations in characteristics > Sources of variations" data-href="Variations in characteristics#Sources of variations" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/basic-genetics/variations-in-characteristics.html#Sources_of_variations" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sources of genetic variations</a>

<br>
Some genetic variations are inheritable and can be passed on to offspring. (*)<br>
The variations accumulate through many generations. Individuals with favourable characteristics become more frequent in the population. The organism has evolved and become different from its ancestor.

<br>
Environmental changes give stresses to organisms.<br>
Selection pressure (the changes in condition) favours a particular form of the species. They have a selective advantage to survive and reproduce more successfully.

<br>↪️ The proportion of the favoured form increases in subsequent generations, while proportion of the less-well-adapted form decreases.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>
Beetles / Peppered moths<br>

Note
Bacteria have a short generation time and reproduce very quickly. The amount of time required for developing antibiotic resistance is shorter, as each cell division may create mutations from DNA replication or damage by mutagens.

 <br>Speciation depends on two factors: isolation and genetic variation.<br>
<br>
Isolation of populations of species<br>

<br>
Mutations and genetic variations<br>
Genetic variations may exist between isolated populations of species. Moreover, the isolated groups may each face different selection pressure (different environmental conditions), different favourable alleles are passed on to offspring in each isolated group.

<br>
Accumulation of variations<br>
Variations accumulate in each isolated group over many generations. When the population evolve enough genetic change that it can no longer interbreed to produce fertile offspring, it is considered as a new species.

<br><br><img alt="isolation_types.webp" src="lib/media/isolation_types.webp"><br>
<br>
Geographical isolation<br>
Separation of populations by physical barriers prevent mating.

<br>
Behavioural isolation<br>
Organism has a behaviour that is considered unfavourable and chooses not to mate.

<br>
Temporal isolation<br>
The mating times of the organisms do not match up.

 <br>Growth is the permanent and irreversible increase in the dry mass and size of an organism. In multi cellular organisms, growth involves the following processes:<br>
<br>Cells carry out mitotic cell division, resulting in an increase in cell number.
<br>Cells use food substances to synthesize organic matter or biomass, resulting in an increase in cell size.
<br>Development is the irreversible increase in complexity (form) of an organism. This involves differentiation, where cells specialize into different types for performing different functions, achieving a division of labour among cells. These specialized cells may also group together to form tissues, organs or systems.<br><br>

<br>
Dry mass decreases in the early stages of germination. Some of the stored food is used in respiration to provide energy for growth.

<br>
Dry mass increases. Green leaves have developed and started to carry out photosynthesis. When the rate of photosynthesis is higher than the rate of respiration, the production of food is faster than the consumption of food. This results in a net gain of organic matter.

<br>
The dry mass decreases because the plant disperses seeds and fruits.

<br><br>Growth is restricted to regions with meristems present, which is a group of undifferentiated cells (meristematic cells) that can undergo <a data-href="mitotic cell division" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/cell-cycle-&amp;-division/mitotic-cell-division.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mitotic cell division</a> continuously to form new cells.<br>Main types of meristems:<br>
<br>
Apical meristems<br>
They are located at root tips and shoot tips, the cells produced elongate, leading to an increase in the length of the root. Growth as a result of these cells are called primary growth.

<br>
Lateral meristems<br>

<br>Childhood: Growth rate slows down considerably over the next 8 to 10 years.
<br>Adolescence: Another period of active growth at puberty.
<br>Adulthood: No net growth occurs, person reaches maximum size, but cell division still continues to replace damaged or dead cells.
<br>Old age: Growth becomes negative (decrease in weight/height).

 <br>Tip
Most important details of the parameters are included, namely:

<br>Advantages
<br>Disadvantages
<br>Reason for selection

<br>Info
Growth parameters can be represented using <a data-href="sigmoid growth curves" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/growth-and-development/sigmoid-growth-curves.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">sigmoid growth curves</a>.
<br><br>Dry mass is the mass of an organism after all the water has been removed from its body. It is usually obtained by heating the organisms in an oven slightly above 100°C, until a constant mass is obtained upon repeated weighing.<br>Advantages:<br>
<br>It provides an accurate measurement of growth, showing the actual amount of organic matter (biomass) in an organism.
<br>Disadvantages:<br>
<br>It is impossible to make a continuous measurement on the same organism as they are killed. A large number of the same type of organisms are needed in order to measure growth over a period of time.
<br>It is time-consuming.
<br>It is impractical to measure the dry mass of large organisms, such as a large tree.
<br><br>Fresh mass is the total mass of an organism, including its water content.<br>Advantages:<br>
<br>Measuring fresh mass is fast and convenient.
<br>Repeated measurements can be made on the same organism over a (longer) period of time as it causes no harm to the organisms.
<br>Disadvantages:<br>
<br>Measurement is less accurate and cannot show the actual biomass of the organism as it is easily affected by factors unrelated to growth.
<br>Tip
Water content varies with environmental factors (e.g. temperature &amp; water supply) and behaviours of the organism (e.g. drinking, feeding and urination).
<br><br>Size measures the change in size of the whole organism or of a body structure over a period of time.<br>Advantages:<br>
<br>Measuring size is fast and convenient.
<br>Repeated measurements can be made on the same organism or structure over a period of time as it causes no harm to the organism or its body structure.
<br>Disadvantages:<br>
<br>Growth in other dimensions may be neglected as the size of an organism or body structure is often measured in one dimension only.

 <br>Genetic code is a set of rules that determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein. It is stored in the sequence of nucleotide bases in the DNA of a gene.<br>It has the following features:<br>
<br>
Triplet code<br>
A sequence of three consecutive bases (triplet / codon) on a DNA strand codes for one amino acid.

<br>
Degenerate code<br>
There are four types of bases in DNA, different combinations produce 64 triplet codes to specify 20 types of amino acids used to make proteins.<br>
The excessive number of triplet codes means that certain triplet codes code for the same amino acids.

<br>
Some triplet codes serve as 'start signals' or 'stop signals' for protein synthesis.

<br>
The code is read in a continuous manner. There is no break between codes.

<br>
The code is non-overlapping. The adjacent triplet do not share a base.

<br>
The code is universal. The same triplet code codes for the same amino acid in all species.

 <br>A mutation is a sudden and permanent change in the DNA / gene / chromosome of an organism. Mutations can be classified into two types.<br><br>A gene mutation is a change in the base sequence of DNA in a gene.<br>Types of gene mutations:<br>
<br>Insertion: One or more bases are added to the sequence.
<br>Deletion: One or more bases are lost from the sequence.
<br>Substitution: One or more bases are replaced by others.
<br>Inversion: A sequence of bases is reversed.
<br>Insertion or deletion of bases by a number other than a multiple of three will shift the reading frame. Every codon after the point of mutation will be affected. The protein produced have a different sequence of amino acids and usually cannot function.<br>
↪️ See also: <a data-href="Genetic code" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/molecular-genetics/genetic-code.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genetic code</a> (Triplet code)<br>Substitution or inversion of bases does not cause a reading frame shift, but changes one codon for another. It may cause several effects on the amino acid sequence:<br>
<br>
Codon codes for the same amino acid (silent mutation)<br>
Amino acid sequence remains the same.<br>
↪️ See also: <a data-href="Genetic code" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/molecular-genetics/genetic-code.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genetic code</a> (Degenerate code)

<br>
Codon codes for a different amino acid<br>
Amino acid sequence is changed, the polypeptide may fold into a protein with a different conformation, the protein may not function properly.

<br>
Codon changes the amino acid to a stop codon<br>
Translation comes to a stop prematurely. The polypeptide produced will be shorter than normal and probably cannot function.

<br>Tip

<br>Change in a nucleotide in the base sequence may lead to a change in the triplet code. This may change the amino acid sequence of the protein produced.
<br>As a result, the protein produced may fold into a different shape and lose its function.

<br><br>A chromosome mutation is a change in the structure of <a data-href="chromosomes" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/dna,-chromosomes-&amp;-genes/chromosomes.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">chromosomes</a>. It affects large segments of DNA containing many genes.<br><br>
<br>Deletion: A segment of a chromosome is lost.
<br>Duplication: A segment of a chromosome is inserted to the homologous chromosome.
<br>Inversion: A segment of a chromosome breaks off and rotates through 180° before rejoining.
<br>Translocation: A segment of a chromosome breaks off and becomes attached to a non-homologous chromosome.<br>
↪️ These changes often arise from errors during the <a data-href="crossing over" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/cell-cycle-&amp;-division/crossing-over.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">crossing over</a> of chromosomes in meiosis.
<br><br>Non-disjunction is when the members of a pair of homologous chromosomes fail to separate during <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Meiotic cell division" data-href="Meiotic cell division" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/cell-cycle-&amp;-division/meiotic-cell-division.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">meiosis</a> I, and they end up in the same gamete. Alternatively, sister chromatids may fail to separate during <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Meiotic cell division" data-href="Meiotic cell division" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/cell-cycle-&amp;-division/meiotic-cell-division.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">meiosis</a> II.<br>The above results in gametes with an abnormal number of chromosomes (e.g. extra or missing chromosome).<br>Note

<br>Zygotes lacking an entire chromosome rarely survive. Zygotes with an extra chromosome may survive and develop, but usually develops a syndrome of disorders.

<br><br>
<br>Spontaneous mutations: Occur naturally and randomly with no outside causes.
<br>Induced mutations: Exposure to mutagens (agents that can increase the rate of mutations).
<br><br>Examples of mutagens ⤴️<br>Explanations for mutations:<br>
<br>Some mutagens affect DNA by changing the structure of the bases and causes them to pair with the wrong base.
<br>Some mutagens have structures that resemble nucleotides, so they can be incorporated into the DNA molecule and cause errors in <a data-href="DNA replication" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/molecular-genetics/dna-replication.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">DNA replication</a>.
<br>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation changes the structure of DNA and interfere with DNA replication. Ionizing radiation (e.g. X-rays and gamma rays) can damage DNA molecules directly, or they can ionize other molecules (e.g. water) to form free radicals. Free radicals are highly reactive, and can cause DNA damage and give rise to mutations.
<br><br><br>Occurring in somatic cells:<br>
<br>Not passed on to the offspring.
<br>Only daughter cells derived from the mutated cells are affected.
<br>Occurring in gametes or gamete-producing cells:<br>
<br>Passed on to the offspring.
<br>Mutated DNA occurs in every cell of the offspring.
<br><br>
<br>Gene mutation can result in a change in the conformation and function of the protein. Many genetic disorders are caused by improper function of proteins.
<br>Mutations that result in a significant loss of genetic material (e.g. deletion of a segment of a chromosome) are most likely lethal.
<br><br>The gene mutation may cause no change in the phenotype:<br>
<br>If the mutation occurs in a non-coding region of the DNA (it does not code for proteins).
<br>If the mutation is a silent mutation, the triplet codes still code for the same amino acids, the sequence of amino acids is unchanged.
<br>If the change of amino acids do not change the shape of the protein sufficiently, it can still function properly.
<br>If the mutated allele is recessive to the normal allele and is not expressed in the heterozygous solution.
<br>Note

<br>The majority of mutations are neutral.
<br>If a mutation does cause a change in the phenotype, but the change gives no particular advantage or disadvantage to the organisms, then the effect is also regarded as neutral.

<br><br>Mutations provide a source of genetic variations, and may give rise to new characteristics that help organisms become better adapted to a particular environment.<br>Well-adapted organisms have a better chance to survive and reproduce, they pass on their genes to the next generation. This is natural selection and the mechanism of evolution.]]></description><link>biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/molecular-genetics/mutations.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Biology/Reproduction &amp; Genetics/Molecular Genetics/Mutations.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:19:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Transcription]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>The RNA polymerase makes use of one DNA strand as a template (the template strand).
<br>Exposed nitrogenous bases of the DNA attract and form <a data-href="hydrogen bonds" href="chemistry/structures-and-patterns-in-chemicals/structure-and-bondings/simple-molecules/intermolecular-forces/hydrogen-bonds.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">hydrogen bonds</a> with their complementary and free RNA nucleotides in the presence of RNA polymerase.

The first day of menstruation is counted as day 1 in the menstrual cycle.
<br>
<br>Menstruation occurs, a process which discharges the shed uterine lining together with blood through the vagina. This lasts about five days.
<br>Pituitary gland secretes more FSH. FSH stimulates follicle development in the ovary.
<br>Developing follicle secretes oestrogen.

<br>Uterine lining thickens.
<br>Secretion of FSH and LH is inhibited through negative feedback, preventing the development of other follicles and ensures only one ovum is released in each menstrual cycle.


<br><br>
<br>Level of oestrogen continues to rise and peaks just before ovulation.
<br>The pituitary gland is stimulated to secrete more FSH ad LH., stimulating ovulation to occur, where a mature follicle ruptures and releases an ovum into the oviduct.
<br><br>
<br>A high LH level causes the ruptured follicle to develop into a yellow body (corpus luteum), which secretes oestrogen and progesterone. This also cause a rise in body temperature just after ovulation.
<br>Progesterone together with oestrogen maintains the thickness of the uterine lining and stimulates blood vessel development in the lining in preparation for the implantation of an embryo.
<br>A high oestrogen and progesterone level inhibit the secretion of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland, preventing the development of another follicle or further ovulation within the same menstrual cycle.
<br>A low LH level causes the yellow body to degenerate, leading to low levels of oestrogen and progesterone in the blood. The uterine lining cannot maintain its thickness and breaks down by menstruation.
<br>Low levels of oestrogen and progesterone no longer inhibit the pituitary gland, FSH secretion is increases, a new cycle begins.

 <br><br>A few weeks before birth, the fetus changes its position so that its head is downwards just above the cervix.<br>At the start of child birth, muscles of the uterus contract regularly when labour begins, with the contractions gradually becoming more frequent and powerful.<br><br>
<br>
Dilation of the cervix<br>
<img alt="labour1.webp" src="lib/media/labour1.webp" style="width: 240px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
The cervix dilates to let the head of the fetus pass through.<br>
The amnion breaks and amniotic fluid flows out through the vagina, which helps lubricate the vagina for the passage of the fetus.

<br>
Expulsion of the fetus<br>
<img alt="labour2.webp" src="lib/media/labour2.webp" style="width: 120px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Muscles of the uterus and the abdominal muscles contract strongly, pushing the fetus head-first through the cervix and vagina (birth canal).<br>
The baby takes its first breath after coming out of the internal environment. The umbilical cord is clamped and cut, and the remains of the cord on the baby’s body dries up and falls off a few days later, forming a scar called the navel.

<br>
Expulsion of the placenta<br>
<img alt="labour3.webp" src="lib/media/labour3.webp" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Continued contractions of the uterus cause the placenta to detach from the uterine lining, passing out through the vagina eventually.

<br><br>
<br>During pregnancy, mammary glands in mother's breasts enlarge and become able to produce milk.
<br>Babies are born with the instinct to suck. When the baby sucks the nipples, the breasts are stimulated to produce and release milk in a process called lactation.
<br>Benefits of breast-feeding for babies:<br>
<br>Breast milk contains the right amounts of all essential nutrients for the baby.
<br>Proteins in breast milk is easy for babies to digest and absorb.
<br>Breast milk contains enzymes (e.g. amylase, lipase, protease) to help digest food. This is because babies are born with an immature pancreas, so they get most of this essential digestive enzyme through breast milk.
<br>Breast milk contains antibodies that help protect babies against some infectious diseases (e.g. pneumonia, ear infections, etc).

<br>Warning
The woman is not considered pregnant before the embryo then implants into the uterine lining.
<br>
<br>The embryo reaches the uterus around seven days after fertilization, containing 200 to 300 cells. It embeds itself in the uterine lining in a process called implantation. This marks the start of pregnancy.
<br><br><img alt="amnion.webp" src="lib/media/amnion.webp" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
As the embryo continues to develop in the uterus, some cells of the embryo form a membrane called the amnion.<br>The amniotic cavity between the amnion and embryo is also filled with amniotic fluid. It has the following functions:<br>
<br>Act as a shock-absorber, protecting the embryo from mechanical injury.
<br>Prevents the embryo from drying out (desiccation).
<br>Provides a stable environment (e.g constant temperature, pH, etc.) for the embryo.
<br>Allows the embryo some freedom of movement.
<br>Helps lubricate the birth canal during childbirth.

The placenta is composed of tissues from both the mother and the embryo, and has villi containing the embryo's capillaries that grow into blood spaces in the uterine lining and are bathed in the maternal blood after implantation, allowing for the exchange of materials between the embryo and the mother without mixing their blood.<br>Benefits of the adaptation:<br>
<br>It prevents the clumping of embryo's blood and maternal blood when their blood groups are incompatible.
<br>It prevents the high blood pressure of maternal blood from damaging the embryo's delicate blood vessels.
<br>It prevents large pathogens and toxins in the maternal blood from entering the embryo's blood.
<br>The placenta also secretes hormones (oestrogen &amp; progestrone) to help maintain the uterine lining throughout pregnancy, so menstruation will not occur and the embryo can develop in a stable environment.<br><br>Materials that diffuse from maternal blood into embryo's blood:<br>

<br>Materials produced by the embryo and diffuses into the maternal blood:<br>
<br>Metabolic wastes (e.g. urea and carbon dioxide)
<br><br>The embryo is connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord, which contains:<br>
<br>An umbilical vein, carrying oxygenated blood and nutrients.
<br>Two umbilical arteries, carrying deoxygenated blood and waste products.
<br><br>
<br>
Presence of numerous villi<br>
This provides a large surface area for the exchange of materials.

<br>
Embryo's blood is close to the maternal blood<br>
This reduces the distance for diffusion of materials.

<br>
Richly supplied with blood vessels<br>
This allows an efficient transport of materials away from the placenta by maintaining a steep concentration gradient of materials between the embryo's blood and the maternal blood.

Ova are spherical cells about 0.1 mm in diameter.<br>
<br>The cell membrane is covered by a protective jelly coat.
<br>The cytoplasm contains food reserves (yolk) which nourish the developing embryo for about two weeks after fertilization. This makes the ovum much larger than the sperm.
<br>The nucleus is large and contains a haploid number of chromosomes.
<br><br><img alt="ova_production.webp" src="lib/media/ova_production.webp" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Thousands of potential ova are already present in a baby girl before birth, and remain immature until puberty. Each immature ovum is surrounded by follicle cells, forming a follicle.<br>Starting from puberty, female sex hormones are secreted to stimulate follicles and immature ova within them to develop. One mature ovum is released from one of the ovaries each month, about 500 ova would become mature and be released during the lifetime of a female.<br>Tip
Sometime, an ovary releases more than one egg during the same menstrual cycle. This is referred to as hyperovulation. If they are both fertilized by a sperm, it can lead to fraternal twins.

Menstrual blood (including blood, mucus, uterine tissues, unfertilized ovum) is passed out of the body through the vagina.
<br><br>
<br>Secretion of oestrogen (a type of female sex hormone)<br>
The follicle in the ovary develops and secretes oestrogen, which causes the uterine lining to repair and thicken to prepare for implantation of the embryo.
<br>The uterine lining is also richly supplied with blood vessels to prepare for supplying the embryo with oxygen and nutrients.
<br><br>
<br>The mature follicle ruptures and releases an ovum into the oviduct.
<br>The beating action of cilia lining the oviduct creates a current to suck the ovum into the oviducts.
<br><br>
<br>The uterine lining further thickens and is ready for the implantation of the embryo.
<br>The ruptured follicle becomes the yellow body. It later degenerates if the released ovum is not fertilized.
<br>If fertilization occurs and the woman becomes pregnant, the uterine lining does not break down. Menstruation will occur only after the birth of the baby.
<br>Note

<br>Menarche refers to a woman's first menstruation, which usually occurs at the age of about 11.
<br>Menopause occurs when a woman reaches 45 to 55 years of age. As a woman's ovary contain only a set number of follicles, her ovaries will stop releasing ova and menstruation will no longer occur.

<br>The male is sexually stimulated (arousal).
<br>More blood is pumped into his penis (dilation of blood vessels) and the outflow of blood is reduced.
<br>Erectile tissues inside the penis are filled with blood. Penis becomes hard and rigid.
<br>Now, it can be inserted into the vagina of a female for sexual intercourse.
<br>Eventually, muscular contractions of the epididymis, sperm ducts and urethra expel semen out of the penis. The discharge of semen through the penis is called ejaculation.
<br><br><img alt="fertilization_human1.webp" src="lib/media/fertilization_human1.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Note
Only a few hundred sperms will reach the oviducts. This is because:

<br>Some sperms are trapped by mucus in the vagina.
<br>Some sperms are killed by the acidic secretion of the vagina.
<br>Some sperms may be defective and immotile.

<br><img alt="fertilization_human2.webp" src="lib/media/fertilization_human2.webp"><br>
<br>Sperms will try to penetrate an ovum.
<br>Enzymes are released from their acrosomes to breakdown the jelly coat of the ovum.
<br>Once the head of a sperm enters the ovum, the jelly coat changes to prevent other sperms from entering.
<br>Finally, the nucleus of the sperm fuses with the nucleus of the ovum, forming a zygote.

<br>Cutting: A short length of stem, root or a leaf from the parent plant (e.g. African Violet, Hong Kong Orchid Tree) is cut and cultivated into a new plant.
<br>Advantages:<br>
<br>Can be used to propagate plant varieties quickly, especially those with desirable or rare characteristics.
<br>Daughter plants obtained will have consistent quality, because they are genetically identical to the parent plant.

 <br>In the dispersal of seeds and fruits, external agents (e.g. animals, wind, water) are often required.<br>This process is important because it avoids overcrowding, while also allowing the plant species to colonize new areas.<br><br><br>
<br>
Use of brightly coloured, fleshy and scented fruits (e.g. tomatoes)<br>
Attract animals to feed on, then discarding or swallowing the seeds.

<br>
Swallowed seeds<br>
Seeds are usually small and have hard seed coats to withstand the actions of digestive enzymes. By the time they are expelled in animals' faeces, the seed coats are softened.

<br>
Hooks or spines<br>
These structures allow the fruit to stick to the fur of animals.<br>
(e.g. burdock fruits can cling to the fur of dogs)

<br><br>Some plants produce fruits that are very light, and has structures to act as 'parachutes' or 'wings' to float or glide in the wind. They can be dispersed by wind.<br>
(e.g. dandelion, sugar maple)<br>This method of dispersal allows them to transport seeds or fruits over long distances.<br><br>Fruits of some freshwater and coastal plants depend on water for dispersal.<br>
For example, coconut fruit has air spaces that allow it to float and be dispersed by water currents.<br><br>Seeds of pea pods are distributed by this method:<br>
<br>When pea pods are mature, their fruit walls dry up and shrink.
<br>This gradually builds up pressure within the pods, eventually causing the pods to 'explode', scattering the seeds away.

<br>
Under adverse conditions (e.g. cold winder), the aerial part of the plant dies, the storage organ remains dormant.

<br>
Under favourable conditions, a bud grows and develops a new shoot and adventitious roots using the food reserves in the storage organ.

Key:<br>
→ Blue: Cross-pollination<br>
→ Pink: Self-pollination
<br><br>Self-pollination occurs when pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of the same flower, or another flower of the same plant.<br>
<br>This can increase the chances of fertilization when a plant species is rare or its members are separated by long distances.
<br>However, it results in inbreeding and less genetic variation.
<br>Cross-pollination occurs when pollen grains are transferred from the anther of one plant to the stigma of a flower in another plant of the same species.<br>
<br>This results in more genetic variations among the offspring, as the gametes from two different parents are brought together.
<br>Some offspring may have characteristics that enable them to survive environmental changes better, increasing the chance of survival of the species.

<br>Fast — one parent plant can produce a large number of offspring under favourable conditions.
<br>Desirable characteristics of the parent are retained in the offspring.
<br>Large amounts of food reserves are available in storage organs for the growth of the offspring.
<br><br>
<br>All offspring are identical and there is no genetic variation.<br>
The species is less able to adapt to environmental changes.
<br>Overcrowding may occur because all offspring are near to the parent plant.<br>
This lead to intense competition for resources.
<br>The chance for disease transmission from parent plants to offspring is higher.
<br><br>*Main article: <a data-href="Sexual reproduction" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/reproduction/sexual-reproduction.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sexual reproduction</a><br><br>
<br>Genetic variation exists among offspring. This allows the species to adapt to environmental changes.
<br>Fruits and seeds are usually dispersed away from the parent plants. This can prevent overcrowding and reduce competition for resources.
<br>The chance of disease transmission from parent plants to offspring is lower.
<br><br>
<br>Slower — two parents are involved and external agents are required.
<br>Large amounts of resources and energy are required in producing flowers and fruits, and many seeds are wasted if conditions for germination are poor.
<br>Seeds only contain limited food reserves to support growth of offspring.

<br>Sepals are the outermost ring of a flower. It makes up the calyx. They are leaf-like structures and are usually green, protecting the flower bud.
<br>Petals are the second ring of a flower. It makes up the corolla. In many flowers, it is brightly coloured and scented to attract insects. There are insects guides (lines or marks) to direct insects to the nectaries.
<br>Nectaries are glands that produce nectar, a sugary liquid insects feed on.
<br><br>Stamens are the male reproductive parts. Each stamen has a filament (a thin stalk) that supports an anther at its tip.<br>An anther consists of four pollen sacs where <a data-href="meiotic cell division" href="biology/reproduction-&amp;-genetics/cell-cycle-&amp;-division/meiotic-cell-division.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">meiotic cell division</a> occurs to produce pollen grains, containing the male gametes. When the anther is ripe, the pollen sacs split open, exposing their pollen grains.<br>Warning
Pollen grains are not the male gametes, they act as structures that facilitates the male gametes to reach the female gametes.
<br><br><img alt="carpels.webp" src="lib/media/carpels.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Carpels are the female reproductive parts.<br>
<br>The stigma is the tip of a carpel that receives pollen grains. A mature stigma may secrete a sugary solution to pick up pollen.
<br>The style is a stalk that connects the stigma to the ovary.
<br>The ovary encloses one or more ovules that contain the female gametes of ova.

<br>The ovule is connected to the inner wall of the ovary by a short stalk called funicle, and is surrounded by integuments (a protective layer). There are tiny holes in the integuments called micropyle.


<br>Info
In bisexual flowers, there exists both stamens and carpels.<br>
Flowers containing either stamens or carpels only are called unisexual flowers.

<br>Details of indicators:<br>
<br>The colour of the indicator can indicate the environment of the reaction mixture.
<br>End point is the moment when the indicator change its colour (to a neutral colour).
<br>Limitation / Source of error: The end point is assumed to be the equivalence point.<br>
<br>The end point and the equivalence point usually occur at slightly different times during a titration.
<br><br>Titration curve of different experiments:<br>
<img alt="acid_base_indicator_titration_curve.webp" src="lib/media/acid_base_indicator_titration_curve.webp"><br>Principle for choosing an indicator:<br>
<br>The indicator needs to change its colour within the pH range of the vertical part of the titration curve.
<br>The end point of the indicator needs to be within the pH range of theequivalence point.
<br>Conclusion:<br>
<br>Strong acid only: Methyl orange
<br>Strong alkali only: Phenolphthalein
<br>Strong acid and alkali: Methyl orange or phenolphthalein

 <br>Colorimetry

<br>Colorimetry is used for determining the concentration of a coloured substance with a colorimeter.<br><br><img alt="colorimeter.webp" src="lib/media/colorimeter.webp"><br>
<br>Visible light of suitable wavelengths are passed through the coloured sample solution.
<br>The sample solution absorbs part of the light and transmits the remaining part of the light. The more concentrated the coloured sample solution, the larger amount of light it absorbs.
<br>The fraction of light transmitted (light transmittance) is then detected, and the absorbance is shown in a meter.
<br>By measuring the light absorbance of the sample solution, the value can be used to find the concentration of the solution by using a calibration curve.
<br>Solution for low colour intensity
In order to measure absorbance of solutions with low colour intensity, reagents that can increase the colour intensity can be added. For example:

<br><br><img alt="colour_wheel.webp" src="lib/media/colour_wheel.webp" style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>A colour filter of a complementary colour to the colour of the sample is chosen (based on the colour wheel).
<br>The coloured species samples absorbs the complementary colour to a large extent, so colorimetry can be more efficient.
<br><br>Calibration curves show how the absorbance increases when the concentration of the corresponding coloured substance increases in a solution.<br><img alt="calibration_curve.webp" src="lib/media/calibration_curve.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Example: HKDSE 2016 Paper 2 Q3(b)<br><br>
<br>Choose a suitable colour filter which is of complementary colour of the solution.
<br>Put a test tube containing distilled water only (blank solution) into the colorimeter and set its absorbance to zero.
<br>Prepare a set of standard solutions of the sample with different concentrations. Record their absorbance by colorimetry separately.
<br>Plot a calibration curve of absorbance against concentration.

 <br>Mass spectrometry is used to determine the relative atomic mass of an element and relative molecular mass of a compound, as well as the structure of an unknown compound.<br>Advantages:<br>
<br>Time for analysis is short.
<br>Very small amount of sample is needed.
<br>The sample can be in gaseous, liquid or solid states.
<br>High accuracy in determining molecular mass of compounds.
<br><br><img alt="mass_spectrometry.webp" src="lib/media/mass_spectrometry.webp"><br>
<br>
Vaporization

<br>The sample is first vaporized to gaseous form.
<br>It can be an element or a compound.


<br>
Ionization

<br>The gaseous sample is bombarded by a beam of fast-moving electrons.
<br>Electrons from the molecules of the sample are knocked out, forming positive molecular ions ().


<br>When molecular ions collide with electrons, they will undergo fragmentation, producing fragment ions.




<br>
Acceleration

<br>The positive ions. including molecular ions and fragment ions, are accelerated by an electric field towards a magnetic field.


<br>
Deflection

<br>The positive ions are deflected by a magnetic field.
<br>Ions with lower mass-to-charge ratio (m/e or m/z) are deflected more.
<br>Ions with higher mass-to-charge ratio are deflected less.
<br>By varying the electric field and magnetic field, ions of different m/e can enter the detector.


<br>
Detection

<br>The detector produces electrical signals proportional to the number of ions detected.
<br>The signals are recorded and presented in a mass spectrum.


<br><br>A mass spectrum show the relative intensity (or relative abundance) of positive ions generated against the mass-to-charge ratio of positive ions.<br><img alt="mass_spectrum.webp" src="lib/media/mass_spectrum.webp" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;">]]></description><link>chemistry/analytical-chemistry/instrumental-analysis/mass-spectrometry.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Chemistry/Analytical Chemistry/Instrumental analysis/Mass spectrometry.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 01:53:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib/media/mass_spectrometry.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib/media/mass_spectrometry.webp&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Colours of substances]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Chromatography can be used for separating different solutes in a solution.<br>Types:<br>
<br>Paper chromatography
<br>Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
<br>Column chromatography
<br>Phases:<br>
<br>Stationary phase (fixed in position)
<br>Mobile phase (moves in one direction)
<br><br><br><img alt="paper_chromatgraphy.webp" src="lib/media/paper_chromatgraphy.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Phases:<br>
<br>A thin film of water is held by the cellulose fibres in the paper. The water film of the paper acts as the stationary phase.
<br>The developing solvent (alcohol-water) mixture acts as the mobile phase.
<br>Process:<br>
<br>A baseline is drawn with a pencil across the bottom of a strip of filter paper.
<br>A drop of black ink is added on the baseline and allowed to dry.
<br>The paper is then suspended in an alcohol-water mixture (developing solvent), with the ink spot above the solvent level.
<br>Warning
The level of the solvent should not be higher than the baseline.
<br>Separation of components:<br>
<img alt="paper_chromatography_separated.webp" src="lib/media/paper_chromatography_separated.webp" style="width: 420px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Different components (with different colours) have different absorptivities / solubilities in the mobile phase and stationery phase.<br>
<br>The more soluble the component in stationary phase, the slower it travels up the stationary phase.
<br>The more soluble the component in mobile phase, the faster it travels up the stationary phase.
<br>Example: HKDSE 2019 Paper 2 Q3(c)(iii)<br>
Explain briefly why chromatography can be used to separate a mixture.<br>
<br>Different components have different solubilities / absorptivities in mobile phase and stationary phase.
<br><br> values (retention ratio) can be used for identification of components.<br><br>Example: HKDSE 2018 Paper 2 Q3(a)(iii)<br>
What is meaning of the ' value' of a substance in a paper chromatogram?<br>
<br> value is the ratio of distance traveled by the component to the distance traveled by the solvent front.
<br>Example: HKDSE 2020 Paper 2 Q3(b)(i-iii)<br>
The chromatograms from thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of aspirin, caffeine, acetaminophen and a drug Y are shown below.<br>
<img alt="2020_p2_q3b.webp" src="lib/media/2020_p2_q3b.webp" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><br>(i) Draw a labelled diagram for the set-up in performing a TLC experiment.<br>
<img alt="2020_p2_q3bi.webp" src="lib/media/2020_p2_q3bi.webp" style="width: 240px; max-width: 100%;"><br>(ii) Calculate the  value for aspirin.<br><br>(iii) Based on the chromatograms provided, suggest whether drug Y would contain aspirin, caffeine or acetaminophen.<br>
<br>Aspirin
<br>Caffeine
<br><br>
<br>A thin layer of silica gel () or alumina powder (), usually coated on glass, aluminium or plastic plate, will be used as the stationary phase.
<br>The developing solvent acts as the mobile phase.
<br>Advantages over paper chromatograpy:<br>
<br>It has a higher speed.
<br>It requires a smaller amount of sample.
<br><br><img alt="column_chromatography.webp" src="lib/media/column_chromatography.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>Similar to thin-layer chromatography, but the amounts of the sample mixture and developing solvent used are much larger.
<br>This method of chromatography allows for separation.
<br>Set-up:<br>
<br>Column is held vertically.
<br>Eluting solvent is kept adding from the top and it runs through the column under gravitational force.

 <br><img alt="lab_fractional_distillation.webp" src="lib/media/lab_fractional_distillation.webp"><br>Principle: (by ethanol and water)<br>
<br>When the mixture is heated, both ethanol and water vaporize.
<br>The vapour contains more ethanol and less water.
<br>Upon rising the column, more water condenses to liquid than ethanol.
<br>After repeated vaporization and condensation, the vapour at the top contains mostly ethanol. The ethanol vapour condenses to liquid in the condenser.

 <br>Liquid-liquid extraction, also solvent extraction, is a process to extract substance from one liquid to another liquid. The liquids used must be immiscible. A <a data-href="separating funnel" href="chemistry/analytical-chemistry/separation-and-purification/separating-funnel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">separating funnel</a> is used for this extraction process.<br><br><img alt="liquid_liquid_extraction.webp" src="lib/media/liquid_liquid_extraction.webp"><br>
Consider the extraction of iodine from aqueous iodine solution (brown in colour) in heptane (purple in colour):<br>
<br>Iodine is more soluble in organic solvents than in aqueous solvents.
<br>(a): Water and heptane is immiscible, they remain as two separate layers. 
<br>(b): After shaking, most of the iodine will dissolve into the heptane layer.
<br>Then, the tap is opened to run off the lower aqueous layer and the top layer of iodine dissolved in heptane can be obtained.
<br>Traces of water can be removed by adding drying agents (e.g. anhydrous , anhydrous ) and then filtered.
<br>The iodine dissolved in heptane can be further <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Fractional distillation" data-href="Fractional distillation" href="chemistry/analytical-chemistry/separation-and-purification/fractional-distillation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">distilled</a> to obtain iodine solid, as heptane has a lower boiling point than iodine solid.
<br>Tip
In the above experiment, haptane is less dense than water and forms the upper organic layer, while water forms the lower aqueous layer. However, students are not expected to deduce this.
<br>Warning

<br>The tap should be opened occasionally to remove vapour pressure, otherwise the stopper may be pushed away.
<br>The stopper should be removed before running off the liquid from the separating funnel, otherwise the liquid may not run.

<br><br><br><br>Example: HKDSE 2016 Paper 2 Q3(c)(ii)(1)<br>
X and Y are isomeric compounds with their structures shown below:<br>
<img alt="16_dse_q3c.webp" src="lib/media/16_dse_q3c.webp" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Both of them are insoluble in water but soluble in dichloromethane. When treated with dilute , no reaction occurs for X but reaction occurs for Y to form a soluble salt.<br>You are provided with dilute  and dilute . Outline an experimental procedure, based on solvent extraction, to separate solid Y from a solution of X and Y in dichloromethane.<br>Solution:<br>
<br>Add  (in excess) into X and Y in dichloromethane.
<br>Transfer the mixture into separating funnel. Shake thoroughly. (The mixture is allowed to settle.)
<br>Run off to obtain aqueous layer which contains salt (/ anion) of Y.
<br>Add dilute  into the aqueous layer until no more precipitate is formed.
<br>Filter to obtain the solid Y.
<br>Tip
When Y reacts with , a sodium salt is produced. Addition of an acid is to reform the original organic compound.

<br>
Choose a suitable solvent that does not react with the solid product.

<br>Water, ethanol, propanone (acetone) are commonly used solvents.


<br>
Dissolve the crude solid product in a minimum amount of hot solvent. Filter to remove the insoluble impurities.

<br>
Allow the hot filtrate to cool down to room temperature, the solute comes out as crystals.

<br>
Collect the crystals by filtration under reduced pressure and dry crystals.

<br>Simple filtration can be sped up by connecting the set-up to a suction pump (suction filtration).


<br>
Wash the crystals with a little amount of cold distilled water or any other suitable solvents to remove any soluble impurities. Then, the crystals are dried with a piece of filter paper or in an oven.

<br>
A catalyst is a substance which changes the rate of reaction with itself being chemically unchanged after the reaction.

<br>Catalyst may undergo chemical change during reaction, but it must be regenerated after the reaction.


<br>
Catalyst increases the rate of reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy.<br>
↪️ See also: <a data-href="Activation energy and energy profiles" href="chemistry/industrial-chemistry/activation-energy-and-energy-profiles.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Activation energy and energy profiles</a>

<br>
A catalyst is needed in a very small amount.

<br>
A catalyst is very specific in action.

<br>
A catalyst is easily poisoned by a small amount of impurities. The catalytic effect will be decreased once the catalyst is contaminated.

<br> catalyst in catalytic converter in motor cars is easily poisoned by lead compounds, leaded fuels cannot be used.<br>

<br>
The catalytic effect will be increased when the surface area of the catalyst is increased (e.g. using porous / finely divided catalysts).

<br>Increasing the surface area of a catalyst will increase the collision frequency between the catalyst and reactant particles.
<br>The effective collision (per unit time) increases and the rate of reaction is increased.


<br>
The use of catalyst doesn't change the enthalpy change () of the reaction.

<br>The amount of total energy released / absorbed will be the same as that in uncatalysed reaction.

<br>Reason for using initial concentration:<br>
<br>The initial concentration of reactants is accurately known.

<br>
Reason for different volume of water and  in different reaction mixture<br>
To allow the concentration of  to be directly proportional to the volume of  used.

<br>
Reason to keep  much higher than <br>

↪️ The initial rate is the reciprocal of the time to form the dark-blue complex.
<br>Reason for  solution is needed in a small and fixed amount:<br>
<br>Fixed amount ensures fair comparison.
<br>If a large amount is used,  will be a limiting reagent,  cannot be used up, dark-blue complex may not be produced. The rate of reaction is not equal to the initial rate.

 <br>Green chemistry is important for achieving sustainable development. It investigates ways to maximize the efficiency of utilization of feedstock, raw materials and energy, while reducing the emission of toxic substances and waste produced during the production process.<br><br>
<br>
Waste prevention<br>
An industrial process is greener when no waste (side products other than products) is produced. (Maximizes atom economy)

<br>
Using less hazardous chemical synthesis<br>
An industrial process is greener when hazardous reactants are not involved.

<br>
Using safer chemical products<br>
Chemicals synthesized should be safe to use and not harm the environment.

<br>
Using saver solvents and auxillaries<br>
Examples: Replacement of VOCs and CFCs

<br>
Designing for energy efficiency

<br>When a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Catalysts" data-href="Catalysts" href="chemistry/industrial-chemistry/catalysts.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">catalyst</a> is used, less energy is needed to heat up the reaction mixture.
<br>Energy is used to heat liquid mixture and purifying productions by distillation.
<br>When the reaction pathway consists of fewer steps, less processes of separation and purification are needed. Less energy is needed.


<br>
Using renewable raw materials / feedstock

<br>Reliance on petroleum-based raw materials is non-renewable.
<br>Renewable raw products mostly come from agricultural products or crops.<br>
Example: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Importance of industrial chemistry" data-href="Importance of industrial chemistry" href="chemistry/industrial-chemistry/importance-of-industrial-chemistry.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Production of vitamin C</a>, as glucose can be extracted from corn.


<br>
Reducing derivatives<br>
Additional reagents should be minimized.

<br>
Using catalyst<br>
<a data-href="Catalysts" href="chemistry/industrial-chemistry/catalysts.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Catalysts</a> can speed up the reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy. Less energy will be needed for synthesis.

<br>Warning
Some catalysts are heavy <a data-href="transition metals" href="chemistry/structures-and-patterns-in-chemicals/structure-and-bondings/transition-metals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">transition metals</a>, they can cause harm to the environment when disposed of into rivers.
<br>
<br>
Designing degradable products<br>
Example: Biodegradable plastics

<br>
Developing real-time analysis for pollution prevention

<br>
Minimizing the potential for chemical accidents<br>
Example: leakages, explosions, fires

<br>
Maximizing atom economy<br>
Atom economy is based on the 100% conversion from reactants to products.<br>


<br>Warning
Do not mix up atom economy and percentage yield.

<br>Atom economy does not involve experimentation, it is based on a 100% completed reaction.
<br>Percentage yield is based on experimental data.

<br>Relationship of atom economy with percentage yield:<br>
Atom economy and percentage yield do not show any relationships.<br>
<br>The calculation of atom economy is based on a 100% complete reaction.
<br>However, most of the reactions do not go to completion, and the yield is related to the extent of reaction.<br>

<br>The x-axis is the (molecular) kinetic energy, the y-axis is the number of molecules.
<br>The area under the curve represents the total number of molecules in the system.
<br>There are very few molecules with high kinetic energies, and no molecules with zero energy.
<br>There is no maximum energy for a molecule.
<br>Most probable kinetic energy: The kinetic energy possessed by the largest number of molecules.
<br>Average kinetic energy: Always lies on the right of the maximum point.
<br>The shaded region under the curve shows the number of particles having energy equal or greater than the activation energy, which can collide effectively and undergo chemical reaction.<br><br>Effects (increase):<br>
<br>There is greater portion of high kinetic energy molecules, distribution curve becomes flatter and lie to the right side.
<br>Most probable kinetic energy and average kinetic energy increase, while the number of molecules having these kinetic energies decrease.
<br>Range of kinetic energy increases as higher kinetic energies can be achieved.
<br>Area under the curves are the same as the number of molecules remain unchanged.
<br>Activation energy () remains unchanged.
<br>Explanation (increase):<br>
<br>An increase in temperature can increase the (average) kinetic energy of molecules.
<br>There is a larger portion of molecules having kinetic energy equal to or greater than activation energy.
<br>The collision frequency and hence the effective collisions per unit time increase. Rate of reaction increases.<br>

 <br>Note
This page mainly discusses the protection of iron.
<br>The methods to prevent rusting are made in accordance with one of the following chemical properties:<br>
<br>To prevent contact of iron to oxygen and water in air
<br>To prevent lost of electrons in iron
<br><br>A protective layer has to be completely coated on an iron made object. This prevents the contact of iron to oxygen and water in air.<br>
<br>
Coating with paint<br>
Cheap way to protect iron made objects in bridges, car bodies and fences.

<br>
Coating with plastic<br>
More expansive than paint, used in coat hangers and paper clips.

<br>
Coating with oil and grease<br>
Used in moving parts of machines. It can also serve as a lubricant.

<br>Protection of moving parts

<br>A machine should be oiled from time to time, as the oil will rub off and dirt would stick to the oil or grease.
<br>Paint or plastic should not be used on moving parts, as it would be scratched off easily.

<br><br>Main article: <a data-href="Electroplating" href="chemistry/redox-reactions,-chemical-cells-and-electrolysis/electrolysis/applications/electroplating.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Electroplating</a><br>
Electroplating is a chemical process which uses electrolysis to place a metal onto the iron made object.<br>Chromium and copper are commonly used as plating metals as they give a shiny appearance. However, this method is expensive.<br><br>In tin-plating, the iron surface is completely coated by tin.<br>
<br>Tin prevents iron from contacting oxygen and water in air. Tin metal is corrosion resistant as it forms a protective oxide layer on the surface.
<br>Tin-plating is widely used in food cans since tin and tin ions are non-poisonous.
<br>Note
Zinc ions are poisonous, they are not used for coating food cans.
<br>
<br>When the tin metal is incomplete (e.g. being scratched), part of the iron will be exposed. Since tin is less reactive than iron, and iron is now in contact with tin, iron will rust even faster than without contacting tin.<br>
↪️ Therefore, tin-plated food can should not be consumed when it is scratched or deformed.
<br><br>Galvanization is zinc-plating, zinc loses electrons more readily than iron to prevent rusting.<br><br>By attaching a more reactive metal (e.g. zinc), the more reactive metal loses electrons more readily than iron. Therefore, iron will not lose electrons and will not rust.<br>The blocks of metal used in protecting iron needs to be replaced from time to time.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>
Attaching zinc blocks to ship hulls<br>
Most ships are made of steel and contains iron. Zinc blocks are attached to the ship hull to prevent iron from rusting.

<br>
Magnesium blocks connected to underground pipelines<br>
Some underground water pipes are made of iron. Magnesium blocks are attached to the underground pipelines to prevent iron from rusting.

<br><br>An alloy is a mixture formed by meting two or more elements (e.g. carbon and chromium) together, in which at least one of them is a metal.<br>Example:<br>
<br>Stainless steel is an alloy of iron made by mixing iron with specific amounts of carbon, chromium and nickel.
<br>However, this method is the most expensive method.<br>Strength of alloys

<br>The introduction of other elements disturbs the regular arrangement of metals in its <a data-href="giant metallic structure" href="chemistry/structures-and-patterns-in-chemicals/structure-and-bondings/chemical-structures-and-properties/giant-metallic-structure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">giant metallic structure</a>.
<br>The metallic ions cannot slide over each other easily when force is applied.

A more reactive metal starts to react at a lower temperature.<br>
<br>
<br>Rate of reaction<br>
A more reactive metal reacts faster.<br>
<br>
<br>Amount of heat released during reaction<br>
A more reactive metal releases more heat during reaction.

<br>Feasible for types of reactions

<br>Reaction with oxygen in air under heating: K - Hg
<br>Reaction with cold water: K - Ca
<br>Reaction with steam: Mg - Fe
<br>Reaction with dilute acids: Ca - Pb

<br><br><br><br>Note

<br>The colour observed may correspond to the colours in <a data-href="flame test" href="chemistry/planet-earth/analytical-tests/flame-test.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">flame test</a> due to the presence of metallic ions in their oxides.
<br>Metals form potassium to iron burn, while metals from lead to mercury does not burn.
<br>Magnesium metal itself produces a characteristic colour when burnt.

<br><br><br>Experiment for reaction of calcium:<br>
The reaction between calcium and water is least vigorous than potassium and sodium, its reaction is commonly carried out:<br>

<img alt="metal_steam_gas_collect.webp" src="lib/media/metal_steam_gas_collect.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>General observable changes:<br>
<br>Metal dissolves gradually (due to formation of soluble metallic ions)
<br>Colourless gas bubbles is given out
<br>Chemical equation: (example with zinc)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Special cases:<br>
<br>Calcium: 
<br>Lead:  / 
<br>Tip
Reaction feasibility and products are based on the dilute acid used.
Some metallic ions (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Salts > Solubility of salts" data-href="Salts#Solubility of salts" href="chemistry/acids-and-bases/salts.html#Solubility_of_salts" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">list</a>) form insoluble solids with the acid. Their reactions stops quickly as insoluble substances form a layer surrounding the metal, which prevents further reaction.
Dilute  produces  when reacting with metals.
<br>Note
Very dilute  can be used to form soluble substances with calcium and lead.<br>
↪️ 
<br><br>Displacement reaction is a reaction between a more reactive metal species and a less reactive metallic ion containing solution. It can be used to deduce the reactivity of metals.<br><br>Example:<br>

<br>Ionic equation: 
<br>Observable changes:

<br>The copper dissolves gradually.
<br>The solution turns from colourless to blue.
<br>Silvery solid deposits on the copper.


<br>Explanation: Copper is more reactive than silver, copper loses electrons more readily than silver.
<br><br>Example:<br>
<br>Chemical equation: 
<br>Observable changes: Reddish brown solid is formed.
<br>Explanation: As zinc is more reactive than copper, zinc will lose electrons more readily than copper.

<br>Reaction of iron:<br>
Iron undergoes oxidation and loses electrons:<br>
<br>
<br>Warning
Iron will not be directly oxidised to give iron(III) ion:<br>

<br>Reaction of oxygen and water:<br>
Oxygen and water gain electrons to become hydroxide ion.<br>
<br><br>Rust () is a reddish brown solid.<br>
<br>
Rust does not attach firmly on the iron metal.<br>
It flakes off easily and exposes the inner iron.

<br>
The rust is also permeable to oxygen and water in air.<br>
Even if the rust does not flake off, oxygen and water can penetrate and contact the inner iron.

<br><br>Rust indicator is an aqueous solution potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) () and phenolphthalein.<br>
<br>Addition of  to the rust indicator can speed up rusting by increasing electrical conductivity.
<br>Consider the following experimental set-up:<br>

When rusting occurs:<br>
<br>Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) turns blue for .
<br>Phenolphthalein turns pink for .
<br>However, if the iron nail is replaced by other metals such as zinc:<br>

Only  is produced.
<br>Pink colour still appear for  produced.
<br><br><br>Acids speed up the rusting of iron.  in the acid can react with  to speed up the formation of .<br>
↪️ <br>Tip

<br>Normal rainwater is acidic as it contains carbonic acid. It can speed up rusting.
<br>Acid rain contains dissolved  and , which can form acids and increases the rate of rusting. This can happen in industrial areas.

<br>Note
Alkaline solution will not speed up rusting, but inhibit rusting in contrast. The  ions in an alkaline solution shifts the equilibrium position of the following reaction to the reactant side.

<br><br>
<br>Soluble ionic compounds contain mobile ions, which increase the electrical conductivity of substances in the environment.
<br>Since rusting involve electron transfer, soluble ionic compounds speed up rusting.
<br>Tip
Iron objects near sea will rust faster since seawater contains salts, which are soluble ionic compound.
<br><br>Higher temperature increases the rate of chemical reaction.<br>Tip
Iron-made car exhaust pipes rusts easily since they become hot when the cars are running.
<br><br>
<br>Iron loses electrons more readily than the less reactive metal.
<br>When iron is attached to a less reactive metal (e.g. tin and copper), rusting speeds up.

A detergent has an ionic head which is hydrophilic and a hydrocarbon tail which is hydrophobic.<br>Note

<br>Detergents are essentially salt solutions.
<br>The cation does not affect in the cleansing action of detergents.

<br><br><br>Water is used to clean substances to wash away dirt on clothes or other surfaces, but it is an ineffective cleansing medium:<br>
<br>
High surface tension (water only)<br>
Water has a high surface tension due to its extensive (intermolecular) hydrogen bonds, causing the water molecules to always hold into a drop. This slows the wetting of fabric surfaces and inhibits the cleansing process.

<br>
Inability to dissolve and remove grease (water + oil)<br>
When grease would bind to dirt particles on a surface, water cannot remove the grease and dirt, as grease is insoluble in water.

<br>To enhance the cleansing ability of water, detergent acts as two agents:<br>
<br>Wetting agent (water only)
<br>Emulsifying agent (water + oil)
<br><br>Detergents are a wetting agent and reduce the surface tension of water, which spreads the water to wet the surface.<br>Detailed explanation:<br>
<br>When the detergent is added into water, the hydrophilic head of detergent would dissolve in the water molecule, and the hydrophobic tail would stick out of the water molecule.
<br>The intervening detergent particles separate water molecules and weaken the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, hence decreasing the surface tension of water.
<br>The water would wet the surface more thoroughly instead of beading up.
<br><br>
<br>Detergents contain a hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail which dissolves in oil;
<br>While it has a hydrophilic ionic head which dissolves in water.
<br>Water molecules attract the hydrophilic ionic head and bring the oil into water.
<br>Upon shaking, the oil will break into droplets and cannot come together again due to repulsion of negative ionic head of detergent.
<br><br><br>Effectiveness:<br>
<br>Soapless detergents work much better than soapy detergent in hard water (water containing  or ), since soapless detergents would not form scum while soapy detergents would with hard water.
<br>Biodegradability:<br>
<br>Determined by its structure (not their source!)
<br>A detergent is biodegradable when there is no branched chains in its structure.
<br><br><br>Soapy detergents are made from natural fats and oils. Natural fats and oils are esters which consists of ester groups ().<br>Example: <a data-href="Lipids#Triglycerides" href="biology/organisation-&amp;-mechanisms/molecules-of-life/lipids.html#Triglycerides" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lipids &gt; Triglycerides</a><br>

<img alt="saponification.webp" src="lib/media/saponification.webp" style="width: 700px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
↪️ This process is called saponification.<br><br>
<br>
Heat the vegetable oil with concentrated  solution (which allows saponification).

<br>
After the reaction, add concentrated  solution into the reaction mixture to help salting out of the soap.

<br>Note

<br>As soapy detergent is a salt with ionic bonds, it would be soluble in water.
<br>Addition of concentrated  solution decreases the solubility of soap in the reaction mixture to allow extraction of soapy detergent in the form of solid.

<br>

 <br>Cracking is a thermal decomposition reaction to break down a larger chain hydrocarbon molecule into smaller alkanes and alkenes.<br>Importance of cracking:<br>
<br>Production of extra petrol to meet demands
<br>Produce alkenes (raw material for making other chemicals, e.g. plastics)
<br>Types of cracking:<br>
<br>Thermal cracking
<br>Catalytic cracking
<br>Tip
When a long chain alkane is cracked, there aren't enough hydrogen atoms to make two alkanes. Hence, cracking will usually produce one alkane and one alkene.
<br><br>Catalytic cracking breaks down the large alkanes to smaller alkanes and alkenes with the help of heat and catalyst in the absence of oxygen.<br><img alt="catalytic_cracking.webp" src="lib/media/catalytic_cracking.webp"><br><br>Thermal cracking is a process of cracking where vaporised long chain alkane is mixed with steam at very high temperatures, and does not involve a catalyst.]]></description><link>chemistry/organic-chemistry/reactions/cracking.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Chemistry/Organic Chemistry/Reactions/Cracking.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 03:35:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib/media/catalytic_cracking.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib/media/catalytic_cracking.webp&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[With conc. <span class="math math-inline is-loaded"><mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="CHTML"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c48"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-msub><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mpadded><mjx-block style="width: 0px;"><mjx-mphantom><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D434 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-mphantom></mjx-block></mjx-mpadded></mjx-texatom></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: -0.15em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mpadded><mjx-block style="margin: -0.666em 0px 0px;"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c32"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-block></mjx-mpadded></mjx-texatom></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msub><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c53"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c4F"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-msub><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mpadded><mjx-block style="width: 0px;"><mjx-mphantom><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D434 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-mphantom></mjx-block></mjx-mpadded></mjx-texatom></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: -0.15em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mpadded><mjx-block style="margin: -0.677em 0px 0px;"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c34"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-block></mjx-mpadded></mjx-texatom></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msub></mjx-texatom></mjx-math></mjx-container></span>]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Functions of the reagent:<br>
<br>
As a catalyst<br>
Addition of concentrated sulphuric acid will speed up the reaction and therefore the equilibrium is achieved more quickly.

<br>
As a dehydrating agent<br>
Concentrated sulphuric acid is hygroscopic and helps in removing the water content of the reaction by shifting the equilibrium position to the product side.

<br>Tip
The ester formed will have the lower boiling point, so it will be distilled off once it is formed. This helps shift the equilibrium position to the product side.

<br>Functions of the reagent:<br>
<br>
As a catalyst<br>
Addition of concentrated sulphuric acid will speed up the reaction and therefore the equilibrium is achieved more quickly.

<br>
As a dehydrating agent<br>
Concentrated sulphuric acid is hygroscopic and helps in removing the water content of the reaction by shifting the equilibrium position to the product side.

<br>Tip
The ester formed will have the lower boiling point, so it will be distilled off once it is formed. This helps shift the equilibrium position to the product side.

 <br>Fractional distillation of petroleum separates the petroleum into fractions by physical method. It makes use of the different molecular sizes and boiling points of hydrocarbon fractions.<br><br><br><img alt="petroleum_distillation_lab.webp" src="lib/media/petroleum_distillation_lab.webp" style="width: 350px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>Heat the mineral wool soaked with petroleum very gently. Fraction with the lowest boiling point range distils off first.
<br>Then, heat the mineral wool more strongly, fractions with higher boiling point ranges distill off one after the other.
<br>Collect various fractions in turn in separate test tubes.
<br><br><img alt="petroleum_distillation_refinery.webp" src="lib/media/petroleum_distillation_refinery.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>The petroleum is heated to ~400°C in a furnace. The hot liquid and partly vapour oil is then pumped into the bottom of a fractionating tower.
<br>The liquid part (with the highest boiling point) sinks to bottom of the tower. Other fractions rises up the tower.
<br>The temperature decrease up the tower. At the appropriate temperature, the fraction cools and condenses to liquid. Condensed hydrocarbons flows out and is collected.

 <br>Hydrocarbons are organic compounds comprised exclusively of carbon and hydrogen.<br><br>
<br>
Aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
Carbon compounds with carbon atoms are joined together in straight chains, branched chains or non-aromatic rings.

<br>
Aromatic hydrocarbons<br>
Carbon compounds with one or more benzene rings.

<br><br><br>Coal is a combustible sedimentary rock containing over 50% of carbon by mass, and also contains trace amounts of sulphur and nitrogen compounds.<br>Usage: Generating electricity<br>Tip
Combustion of coal causes environmental problems (e.g. acid rain) as it contains impurities (elements S &amp; N) that forms acidic oxides.
<br>Formation:<br>
<br>Remains of ancient plants were deeply buried under layers of sand and mud.
<br>High temperature, pressure and the action of bacteria slowly convert the plant remains into coal.
<br><br>Petroleum, also crude oil, is a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons. Natural gas is a gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons, with the main component being methane ().<br>Formation:<br>
<br>Large quantities of dead marine organisms (e.g. planktons and algaes) are buried underneath sedimentary rocks.
<br>Their remains are subjected to intense heat and pressure for a long time.

Cis isomers would have a higher boiling point than trans isomers.

<br>This is because cis isomers are polar, while trans isomers are non-polar.
<br>The van der Waals' force between cis molecules is stronger than that in trans molecules in liquid state.

Trans isomers would have a higher melting point than cis isomers.

<br>This is because trans isomers have a higher packing efficiency than cis isomers.

<br><br>Enantiomers are two non-identical molecules with atoms or groups of atoms arranged in different positions.<br>Properties:<br>
<br>Non-superimposable with mirror image
<br>Chiral
<br>No plane of symmetry
<br><br>(* central C atom is the chiral centre)<br>Warning
Students are only required to identify enantiomers with one chiral centre. However, carbon compounds with more than one chiral centres may not exhibit enantiomerism.
<br>Enantiomers are composed by the same atoms, they have the same molecular size and molecular polarity. Therefore, they have the same physical properties.<br>However, there are differences in their interactions with polarized light (optical activity). This can be measured using a polarimeter.<br>
<br>Rotates clockwise: (+)-isomer
<br>Rotates anticlockwise: (-)-isomer
<br>Tip
Enantiomers can rotate the plane of plane-polarized light in opposite directions.
<br>They also have the same chemical properties as they have the same chemical bonds. They also have the same standard enthalpy change of formation.]]></description><link>chemistry/organic-chemistry/isomerism.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Chemistry/Organic Chemistry/Isomerism.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 15:33:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib/media/isomerism_diagram.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib/media/isomerism_diagram.webp&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sections]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Flame test is a physical test. When the metallic ion is burnt in a Bunsen flame, they will give off different colours. The metallic element in a compound can be identified by the flame colour produced.<br>Choice and cleaning of apparatus
A platinum or nichrome (alloy of nickel and chromium) wire will be used for the test, as they have high melting point and corrosion resistance.
The wire used should be cleaned before the experiment.
To clean the platinum wire, dip the wire into concentrated hydrochloric acid and then heat it in the Bunsen flame until no characteristic flame colour is observed.
<br><br>
<br>Dip a clean platinum / nichrome wire into concentrated hydrochloric acid and heat in Bunsen flame (until no characteristic flame is observed).
<br>Dip the nichrome wire into the concentrated hydrochloric acid and then the solid sample. (If the sample is in aqueous form, use <a data-href="evaporation" href="chemistry/planet-earth/the-ocean/evaporation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">evaporation</a> or <a data-href="crystallization" href="chemistry/planet-earth/the-ocean/crystallization.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">crystallization</a> first)
<br>Put the end of the wire in the (non-luminous) Bunsen flame and observe the flame colour.
<br>Warning
The wire should be heated under naked flame.
Heating the compound when it is placed inside of a test tube does not produce enough heat for the formation of the characteristic flame colours (spectral colours).

 <br><br>Physical change is a change without new substance formed. These changes can be reversed easily.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Changing the state of a substance (e.g. boiling water)
<br>Changing the appearance of a substance (e.g. grinding big lumps of limestone into fine powder)
<br>Dissolving a solid in a liquid (e.g. dissolving sugar in water)
<br><br>The physical properties of a substance are properties that can be observed or measured without changing the chemical composition of the substance.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Melting point, Boiling point
<br>Colour, Odour
<br>State, Density, Hardness
<br>Electrical conductivity
<br>Note
For example, ice melting into water at 0°C is a physical property of ice.
<br><br>Chemical change is a change without new substance formed. These changes are difficult to reverse.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Burning magnesium to form a white powder
<br>Heating a mixture of iron fillings to sulphur to form a dark brown solid
<br>Rusting of iron
<br><br>The chemical properties of a substance are properties that can observed or measured only when the substance undergoes a chemical change to form new substance.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Flammability, oxidizability
<br>Toxicity
<br>Reaction of substances with other matters
<br><br>Iron powder has magnetic property. When iron is mixed with sulphur powder, no particular chemical reaction occurs and no new substances are formed. The mixing process is a physical change. When a magnet is placed near the iron powder, it would try to stick on the magnet and follow its movement.<br>However, when the iron is heated with sulphur, the heat provided triggers a chemical reaction to form a new substance (). The nature of iron has been changed, it can no longer exhibit the magnetic property.]]></description><link>chemistry/planet-earth/fundamentals-of-chemistry/chemical-and-physical-changes-and-properties.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Chemistry/Planet Earth/Fundamentals of Chemistry/Chemical and physical changes and properties.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 16:08:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Classification of matter]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Matter is anything that has a mass and occupies space. It can be classified into pure substance and mixture.<br><br>Note
Comparing pure substances and mixture, pure substances would have sharp physical properties (such as boiling point and melting point) while mixtures do not.
<br><br>Pure substances are single substances that has nothing else mixed with it.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Copper ()
<br>Chlorine ()
<br>Distilled water ()
<br><br>Elements are substances which cannot be broken down into anything simpler by chemical methods. Substances that can be broken down into simpler substances by electricity, for example, are not elements.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Carbon ()
<br>Aluminium ()
<br>Copper ()
<br><br>Compounds are substances composed of two or more elements chemically joined together. They can be broken down into simpler substances by chemical methods.<br>Examples:<br>
<br>Sodium chloride ()
<br>Water ()
<br>Ammonia ()
<br><br>Mixtures consists of two or more substances which are not chemically joined together. Different pure substances in mixtures can be separated by a physical method.<br>Examples:<br>

 <br>Limestone is one of the most common types of rock found in Earth’s crust. It is composed primarily of calcite. The major composition of calcite is calcium carbonate.<br>Calcium carbonate () occurs naturally in mainly three forms:<br>
<br>Chalk
<br>Limestone
<br>Marble
<br>Formation of chalk in the Earth's crust:<br>
<br>Chalk is formed from the skeletons and shells of animals containing calcium carbonate when their dead remains sink to the seabed.
<br>The action of heat and pressure will gradually turn the dead remains into chalk. Earth movements (e.g. earthquakes) will bring these layers of chalk to the Earth's surface.
<br>Differences in strength between chalk, limestone and marble:<br>
Higher pressure and heat cause chalk to turn into much harder limestone. Even higher pressure and heat would turn limestone into marble.<br>
↪️ Strength: marble &gt; limestone &gt; chalk<br><br><img alt="caco3_cycle.svg" src="lib/media/caco3_cycle.svg"><br>
Calcium carbonate () is a white solid / powder, and is insoluble in water.<br>
<br>
Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate<br>
Calcium carbonate will be decomposed on strong heating into calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide.<br>
↪️ 

<br>
Addition of little water to calcium oxide<br>
When a few drops of water is added to calcium oxide (quicklime), it becomes crumbled and water is absorbed. Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) is formed.<br>
↪️ 

<br>
Addition of excess water to calcium hydroxide<br>
When calcium hydroxide is added into excess amount of water, the amount of water is sufficient to dissolve the slightly soluble calcium hydroxide. Soluble aqueous calcium hydroxide (limewater) is formed. It is a colourless solution.<br>
↪️ 

<br>Saturated limewater is used to for chemical tests, it can be produced by adding excess slaked lime () into water, and filtered off to remove the excess undissolved solid.


<br>
Addition of excess carbon dioxide to limewater<br>

Passing carbon dioxide gas into limewater turns it from colourless to milky due to the formation of insoluble calcium carbonate.<br>
↪️ 

<br><br>
<br>
When excess carbon dioxide is passed into limewater, the solution turns from milky to colourless due to the formation of water soluble calcium hydrogencarbonate ().<br>
↪️ 

<br>
Calcium can also react with carbonic acid () to form calcium hydrogencarbonate ().<br>

<br>
Calcium can also react with hydrochloric acid () to give a dissolved salt of , colourless gas bubble of  and .<br>

<br>For neutralising soil acidity
<br>Slaked lime:<br>
<br>For neutralising waste water
<br><br>Air consists of carbon dioxide (some formed naturally while others are from industrial processes). When rain falls, the water reacts with carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid.<br>
<br>Normal rainwater is slightly acidic and has a pH level of 5.0 ~ 5.5. Carbonic acid is not the source to cause acid rain.
<br>Acid rain is caused by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Combustion > Consequences of combustion" data-href="Combustion#Consequences of combustion" href="chemistry/organic-chemistry/reactions/combustion.html#Consequences_of_combustion" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">other pollutants produced from industrial plants|</a>. They dissolve in rainwater to make it more acidic (with a pH level lower than 4).
<br>Corrosion of buildings:<br>
<br>When the carbonic acid in rainwater contacts with calcium carbonate structures, erosion may occur, as a reaction causes the calcium carbonate to form water-soluble calcium hydrogencarbonate ().
<br>These structures will gradually dissolve. Constant repairs are required.

Purification

<br>Water vapour, carbon dioxide and dust are removed as they might accumulate and block the pipes.


<br>
Liquefaction

<br>Purified air is compressed at a very high pressure at the compressor, and passes through the cooling coils to cool down. It then passes through the expansion chamber and is expanded rapidly.
<br>The process is repeated several times until the temperature of air drops to -200°C. The components of air becomes liquefied and the air becomes liquid.


<br>
Fractional distillation of liquefied air

<br>Liquefied air is pumped into the bottom of a fractionating tower with its bottom warmer than its top.
<br>Different components have different boiling points. When the temperature is higher than the boiling point of the component, the component would become gas and start vaporising up the column.


<br><br>Separation of common gases:<br>
<br>Nitrogen is vaporized and is collected at the top as gas.
<br>Argon is also vaporized but condenses at the centre and is collected as liquid.

 <br>Crystallization is a physical process that involves incomplete <a data-href="evaporation" href="chemistry/planet-earth/the-ocean/evaporation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">evaporation</a>. A solution is first heated until it is saturated and let to cool down for crystals to form. Crystals obtained via this method are highly pure, they can be classified as pure substances.<br>
<br>Heat the solution to remove some solvent by <a data-href="evaporation" href="chemistry/planet-earth/the-ocean/evaporation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">evaporation</a> until the solution becomes saturated.
<br>Test whether a solution is saturated

<br>Dip a glass rod into the solution and take it out. The solution is saturated if solid forms on the rod when it cools down.
<br>Add solute (e.g. salts) into the solution. The solution is saturated when the solute can no longer dissolve.

<br>
<br>Allow cooling of the hot saturated solution. Crystallization will start as some solute can no longer dissolve in the solution.
<br>Warning
The solution can either be cooled rapidly or slowly. However:

<br>Rapid cooling provides less time to allow the crystallizing solute to form larger crystals, which leads to the formation of crumble crystals instead.
<br>Slow cooling provides more time to allow the crystallization solution to form larger crystals.

<br>
<br>Separate the crystals formed using <a data-href="filtration" href="chemistry/planet-earth/the-ocean/filtration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">filtration</a>. The crystals are collected as residue.
<br>Wash the crystal with small amount of cold distilled water to wash away any soluble impurities on the crystal surface. Dry the crystal with a filter paper or desiccator.
<br>Note
When crystals are dried in an oven, the high temperature causes the water inside the crystal to evaporate, leading the anhydrous salt in powdered form.

 <br>Simple distillation is a physical process which boils and evaporates the solvent, then condenses its vapour so that the pure solvent can be obtained.<br>Note
Sea water mainly consists of water and dissolved salts, but the dissolved salts have much higher boiling points than water. Water will boil and vaporize upon heating while the dissolved salt will not. Thus, simple distillation is needed to obtain the solvent itself.
<br>Procedures:<br>
<br>
The solution is heated up slowly. The solvent (water) will vaporize and rise the distillation flask when the temperature has reached its boiling point.

<br>The dissolved solutes (e.g. ) has a much higher boiling point than water / is non-volatile, they will not vaporize easily.


<br>
Eventually, the distillate will be collected at the end of the condenser in a conical flask / test tube.

<br>Underlying principles:<br>
<br>Water boils at 100°C while the salts do not.
<br>Water vapour condenses to liquid in the condenser.<br>

<br><br><img alt="simple_distillation_quickfit.webp" src="lib/media/simple_distillation_quickfit.webp" style="width: 550px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>The condenser will be connected to the distillation flash. It provides a lower temperature to condense water vapour.

<br>Cold tap water is kept flowing in the outer layer of the condenser, while the inner layer would condense the water vapour that reaches the top of the distillation flask.
<br>Cooling water enters at the lower end to increase the effectiveness of cooling.


<br>The anti-bumping granules is to ensure even heating and prevents bumping of sea water.
<br>The thermometer is to detect the boiling point of the vapour.
<br>Tip
For accurate control of heating, a water bath can be used as a heat source.
<br><br><img alt="simple_distillation_simple.webp" src="lib/media/simple_distillation_simple.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>The main benefit of this set-up is its relative simplicity and cheapness, since it does not utilize any condenser.
<br>However, the cooling effect is poorer.

<br>A saturated solution is a solution that has dissolved all the solute it can at a given temperature. It can also be a concentrated solution, but may not necessarily be when the maximum degree of saturation at a given temperature is low (e.g. 10%).
<br>A concentrated solution is a solution that has dissolved a relatively large percentage amount of solute. It may not necessarily be a saturated solution and could possibly dissolve more solute at the same temperature.

<br>The reaction rate at the beginning of reaction is the highest as the initial concentration of the reactants is the highest.
<br>The reaction rate then decrease progressively during the reaction as the concentration of reactants decreases with time.
<br>Comparison of reaction rates at different curves:<br>
Comparing curve A and B<br>
<br>The reaction rate for curve A is steeper than curve B as the concentration of  of curve A is higher than curve B.
<br>Curve A levels off earlier than that of curve B as the reaction completes earlier.

<br>The reaction rate for curve C is steeper than curve A as the mass of  of curve C is higher than curve A.
<br>More product is produced as  is the limiting reagent.
<br>Explaining effects of concentration from molecular level:<br>
<br>The number of reactant particles in a unit volume increases when the concentration is increased.
<br>The collision frequency and hence the effective collision increases per unit time.
<br>Note
Changing only the volume of a reagent used (e.g. ) without a change in its concentration results in the same initial rate of reaction.

In some instances, the total volume of the reaction mixture is kept the same between different trials, with a higher volume of the reagent and a lower volume of water in different trials.

<br>Process: Gas given off during a chemical reaction is allowed to escape from the reaction mixture, which causes mass to decrease.
<br>Note

<br>The cotton wool is used to prevent the spilling of the reaction mixture.
<br>Release of hydrogen gas may not be followed accurately, it is too light () to be measured in an accurate way.

<br><img alt="gas_release.webp" src="lib/media/gas_release.webp" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;"><br><br>
<br>Physical parameter: Pressure (of closed reaction system)
<br>Process: A closed system (airtight) is attached to a pressure sensor connected to a data-logger / computer.
<br>Note

<br>This method is suitable for measuring reactions involving hydrogen gas or unbalanced stochiometric ratio of gaseous reactants and products.
<br>The reactants would firstly be separated (as setting up takes time). The vial (or similar) containing the reactants is then tilted to mix with other (solid) reactants.

<br><br>
<br>Description: Useful for reactions involving a change in 
<br>Process: By using a pH meter, and measuring the change of pH value of the reaction mixture throughout the experiment at regular intervals.
<br>Example: <br>Warning
When both reactants and products contain acidic substances, inaccuracies can occur. It is not advised to employ this method in this situation.
<br><br>
<br>Description: Useful for reactions involving the change in concentration / number of mobile ions, as electrical conductivity will change.
<br>Process: An ammeter is used for measuring the electrical conductivity.
<br>Example: <br><br>See also: [[]] <br>
<br>Physical parameter: Light absorbance (of the reaction mixture)
<br>Description: Useful for reactions involving a coloured reactant or product.
<br><img alt="absorbance.webp" src="lib/media/absorbance.webp" style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>Light absorbance is directly proportional to the colour intensity of the reaction mixture. The more intense the colour intensity of the solution, the higher concentration of coloured species in the reaction mixture.
<br>The absorbance of a solution is measured by the colorimeter.
<br>Example: <br><br>In reactions that consumes or produces a solid, the 'disappearing-cross' / 'cross-blocking' method can be used.<br><img alt="transmittance.webp" src="lib/media/transmittance.webp" style="width: 550px; max-width: 100%;"><br>To reach the opaque / turbid stage of the reaction mixture, there must be an enough amount of solid sulphur formed to block the cross.<br>
<br>Physical parameter: Light transmittance / Turbidity
<br>Calculation:  (inversely proportional)
<br>Disadvantages:<br>
<br>The method is not accurate as the average rate is only inversely proportional to the time, not directly equal to.
<br>The initial rate can only be approximated as it is difficult to determine the time to reach the opaque stage.
<br>Example: <br>
↪️ : thiosulphate ion<br>Note

<br>This method is not suitable for applying to reactions which is rapid, since it is not possible to measure the time for the precipitate to form. One example of such reaction is precipitation.
<br>For more accurate measurements, use a light sensor to measure the light transmittance of the reaction mixture.

<br><br>This method involves withdrawing and analysing small portions of known volumes at regular time intervals.<br>Quenching is a method used with this method. It prevents further changes in the concentration of the small portions.<br>Methods:<br>
<br>
Cooling the sample in ice rapidly<br>
Ice provides a low temperature which can slow down the reaction.

<br>
Diluting with large volume of ice-cold water<br>
This can lower both the temperature and concentrations of reactants to decrease the rate of reaction.

<br>
Removing the catalyst<br>
Removing the catalyst can slow down or stop any further reaction.

<br>Advantages:<br>
<br>Titrimetric analysis can be applied to most reactions.
<br>Only simple laboratory apparatus are required.
<br>Disadvantages:<br>
<br>Withdrawal process of samples disturbs the reaction as the volume of the reaction mixture has changed.
<br>Continuous measurement of concentration is impossible.
<br>Titrimetric analysis takes time and thus cannot be used for rapid reactions.
<br><br>Example: HKALE 1997 Paper 2 Q3(a)(i)<br><br>The progress of the reaction can be monitored by a titrimetric method. Outline the experimental procedure.<br>
<br>At regular time intervals, withdraw a known value of the reaction mixture.
<br>Add it to excess  to quench the reaction (in order to remove the catalyst).
<br>Titrate against standard  using starch as indicator.

 <br>Metal couple cells are simple chemical cells consisting of two different metals, one is more reactive while one is less reactive.<br>
<br>An external circuit of an electrical wire connects the two electrodes.
<br>An electrolyte is a substance that contains mobile ions to conduct electricity when in molten or aqueous states.
<br>Oxidation occurs at the more reactive electrode, while reduction occurs at the less reactive electrode.
<br>Consider the following chemical cell:<br>
<img alt="metal_couple_cell_mg+cu+cuso4.webp" src="lib/media/metal_couple_cell_mg+cu+cuso4.webp" style="width: 250px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
-ve electrode (anode / oxidation):<br>
<br>Species that can undergo oxidation: , 
<br>Half equation: 
<br>Explanation:  is a stronger reducing agent than .<br>
(Higher in E.C.S. position)
<br>+ve electrode (cathode / reduction):<br>
<br>Species that can undergo reduction: , 
<br>Half equation: 
<br>Explanation:  is a stronger oxidizing agent than .<br>
(Lower in E.C.S. position)
<br>Observations:<br>
<br> dissolves gradually.
<br>Reddish brown solid deposits on the  cathode.
<br>Electron flow and current flow:<br>
<br>Electron flows from  to  through the external circuit.
<br>Current flows from  to  through the external circuit.
<br>Warning
Electrons only flow through the external circuit. They do not flow through the electrolyte solution.
<br><br>
<br>
Displacement reaction occurs between  strip and  ions in the solution.<br>
The electrons are directly transferred from  to  and they do not flow through the external circuit. This creates a waste of electrons.

<br>
Discharge of  creates a build up of positive ions surrounding the anode.<br>
This hinders the release of electrons from the  strip through the external circuit.

<br>
Discharge of  causes the conc. of negative ions to relatively increase.<br>
This hinders the acceptance of electrons from external circuit to the  strip.

<br>In order to provide a more steady voltage, the following problems has to be solved:<br>
<br>Direct reaction between electrodes in the electrolyte
<br>Imbalance (excess) charges in the chemical cell
<br><br>The cell voltage of a chemical cell can be increased by increasing the difference in E.C.S. position between two metal electrodes.<br>For the above cell:<br>
<br>If  electrode is replaced by  electrode, voltage decreases.<br>
The differences of the metals in E.C.S. decreases.
<br>If  electrode is replaced by  electrode, voltage increases.<br>
The differences of the metals in E.C.S. increases.
<br>Positive voltage and negative voltage:<br>
When the terminals of the voltmeter is connected in the reverse of the polarity of the chemical cell, the voltmeter will show negative voltage.<br><br><img alt="metal_couple_setup.webp" src="lib/media/metal_couple_setup.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
This metal couple setup can be used to compare the reactivity of metals.<br>
<br>For positive voltage, the metal X should be the negative electrode (anode, oxidation), while the copper should be the positive electrode (cathode, reduction).
<br>The larger the differences in tendencies between the metal couples to form ions (further apart in the ECS), the larger the reading of the value in voltage.

 <br>Electrolysis is a chemical process in which electricity is supplied in order to force the redox reaction to occur, converting electrical energy to chemical energy.<br>
<br>The cell undergoing electrolysis is called electrolytic cells.
<br>Attraction of ions between electrodes
Since electricity is supplied intentionally, charges are created in the electrolytic cell. In the electrolyte, cations will be attracted towards the negative electrode, while anions will be attracted towards the positive electrode.
However, this is not the case in chemical cells, as it involves the creation of charges by supply electricity to force reactions to occur.
<br>Basics of electrolysis:<br>
<br>
The electrolytic cell must be connected to an electricity supply (e.g. chemical cell, battery or D.C. supply), with the positive terminal connected to the positive electrode, and vice versa.

<br>
When the electrolysis process involves aqueous solutions, consider the self-ionization of water: 

<br>Types of electrolytes
Aqueous electrolytes contain water, so the self-ionization of water is considered. However, water will not be present in molten electrolytes. The mobile ions in the molten electrolyte will be in liquid state.
<br><br>Consider the electrolysis of molten lead(II) bromide using graphite electrodes:<br>
<img alt="electrolysis_molten_pbbr2.webp" src="lib/media/electrolysis_molten_pbbr2.webp" style="width: 700px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Solid lead(II) bromide is heated in the crucible until it turns molten.<br>
<br>Ions present: , 
<br>At cathode: 
<br>At anode: 
<br>Overall equation: 
<br><br>Reactive electrodes: (e.g. )<br>
<br>These electrodes may participate in the reaction, so they should be considered when determining the electrolysis process.
<br>Inert electrodes: (e.g. platinum, graphite)<br>
<br>These electrodes do not participate in the reaction.
<br>Usage of platinum

<br>Platinum electrodes are readily attacked by halogens and halide ions, they must not be used for such reactions.

<br><br>Warning

<br>This factor mainly affect the discharge of anions.
<br>Specifically, ,   and .

<br><br>
<br>In a very dilute solution, the anions have concentration lower than hydroxide ions, so they are discharged according to the ECS position.
<br>In a dilute or concentrated solution, the anions have concentration higher than hydroxide ions, so the anions are preferentially discharged.
<br>Examples:<br>

<br><br><br>When copper or metals higher in the ECS (higher than hydroxide ion) are used an anode, they are preferentially discharged to give metal ions.<br>Warning

<br>When copper is used as a cathode, it will not be discharged as copper cannot be reduced further.
<br>Lithium, potassium, calcium and sodium cannot be used as an electrode, as they would react with water readily.

 <br>Note
Hydrogen is not an alkali metal, as it behaves very differently compared to Group I alkali metals.
<br>Group I elements are alkali metals. They all have the same number of outermost shell electrons: 1.<br><br>
<br>They are all soft and can be cut with a knife. When they are freshly cut, they give a silvery (metallic) lustre but tarnish rapidly in air (due to reacting with oxygen in air).
<br>They all have low densities (lower than water). Therefore, they would float on water (during reaction with water).
<br>They are highly reactive, and must be stored in paraffin oil to prevent them from reacting with oxygen in air.
<br>They all react vigorously with water to give  and an alkaline solution.<br>
e.g. 
<br>They all react with certain non-metals to form compounds called salt.<br>
e.g. 
<br><br>
<br>
The melting points and boiling points decrease down the group.<br>
For metals, their melting points and boiling points depend on the strength of metallic bond in the metals. The stronger the metallic bond, the more heat energy is required to break the metallic bond so as to melt or boil the metals.

<br>
The reactivity increases down the group.<br>
For metals, their reactivity depends on the tendency of that metal to loss the outermost shell electrons. The easier the metal to lose the outermost shell electron, the more reactive it is.<br>

<br>Tip
Strength of metallic bond decreases down the group as the the electron in the outermost shell is weakly bounded by nucleus.

<br>Tip
Strength of metallic bond decreases down the group as the the electron in the outermost shell is weakly bounded by nucleus.

 <br><img alt="atom_struct.webp" src="lib/media/atom_struct.webp" style="width: 240px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
<br>Every atom has most of its mass concentrated in a tiny region in the centre called the nucleus.
<br>The nucleus contains two types of subatomic particles: protons and neutrons.
<br>The nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of electrons that are rapidly and constantly moving.
<br><br>
<br>An atom is electrically neutral. The number of protons in an atom must equal the number of electrons.
<br>Every atom must have protons and electrons, but every atom does not necessarily have neutrons. Some hydrogen atoms do not have neutrons.
<br>The number of neutrons in an atom may not be identical to the number of protons.
<br><br>Atoms of different elements have different number of protons.<br>
↪️ The number of protons of an element is referred to the atomic number.<br>The mass number of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and atoms in an atom. The number of electrons is not counted as their mass is negligible.<br>
<br>The number of neutrons in an atoms can be deduced by subtracting the mass number by the atomic number.
<br><br><img alt="chemical_shorthand.webp" src="lib/media/chemical_shorthand.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Sometimes, either the mass number or atomic number would be omitted, but they are still displayed at the positions labelled above.<br>It is possible to deduce the number of protons, neutrons and electrons present in an atom with the information provided by the chemical shorthand.<br><br>Electrons move around the nucleus in circular orbits called electron shell.<br>Each electron shell is marked with a number , the maximum number of electrons that a certain electron shell can hold is formulated as .<br>
<br>There can be an infinite number of electron shells for any atom, the shells with electrons are referred to as "occupied electron shells".
<br><br>The electron configuration is for representing the number of electrons of each shell, with each value separated by a comma (",").<br>Examples:<br>
Electronic configuration of sodium atom: 2,8,1<br>
Electronic configuration of oxygen atom: 2,6<br><br><br>Electron diagram showing all electron shells ⤴️<br>Note
Sometimes, an electron diagram showing the outermost shell only is used.
<br><br>All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but atoms of the same element may differ in the number of neutrons.<br>Definition:<br>
Isotopes are different atoms of the same element, with the same number of protons and different number of neutrons.<br><br>
<br>
Isotopes of the same element would have different physical properties (slightly).<br>
e.g. different mass / mass no. / b.p. / density

<br>
The chemical properties of a certain atom are based on the number of (outermost shell) electrons in the atom. Different isotopes of the same element have the same number of (outermost shell) electrons and would have the same chemical properties.

<br>
Horizontal rows in the Periodic Table are called period.

<br>
Vertical columns in the Periodic Table called called group.

<br>
The elements in the Periodic Table are arranged in the order of increasing atomic number.

<br><br>The group number of an element is equal to the number of outermost shell electrons in its atom.<br>
<br>Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties as they have the same number of outermost shell electrons.
<br>Chemicals in the same group in the Periodic Table would show similar chemical properties. However, there is a gradual change of reactivity of the elements as we move down the group.
<br>List of specific groups:<br>

<br><br>The atoms of elements in the same period have the same number of occupied electron shells.<br>Moving across the Periodic Table from left to right, some patterns can be observed.<br>
<br>Elements change from metal to metalloid (semi-metal) to non-metal across a period.
<br>Melting points of elements of elements increase then decrease across a period.<br>
↪️ These patterns are referred to as <a data-href="periodicity" href="chemistry/structures-and-patterns-in-chemicals/periodic-table/periodicity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">periodicity</a>.
<br><br>All noble gases are chemically inert and chemically stable as they have a fully occupied outermost shell electron shell.<br>
<br>Main group elements tend to form compounds in such a way that each atom attained two / eight electrons in its outermost electron shell, giving it the same stable electronic configuration as a noble gas, and thus a stable octet structure.

 <br>In a giant covalent structure, covalent bonds exist between the atoms. The network of covalent bonds and atoms extends throughout the whole structure.<br>Examples of substances:<br>
<br>Diamond ()
<br>Graphite ()
<br>Quartz ()
<br>Note

<br>Diamond and graphite are allotropes of carbon.
<br>Allotropes are different forms of the same element in which the atoms or molecules are arranged in different ways.

<br><br><br><img alt="diamond_drawing.webp" src="lib/media/diamond_drawing.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
In diamond, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with other carbon atoms. The carbon atoms are tetrahedrally arranged around each other. The network of carbon atoms extends throughout the whole structure, resulting in a giant covalent structure.<br>Presence of delocalized electrons
All electrons are used to form covalent bonds, no free electrons are available for conducting electricity.
<br><br><img alt="graphite_drawing.webp" src="lib/media/graphite_drawing.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
In graphite, the carbon atoms are arranged in flat parallel layers.<br>
<br>Within each layer, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other atoms, forming a hexagonal arrangement. Since 3 out of 4 outermost shell electrons of carbon are bonded, the remaining electrons are delocalized along the layers of carbon atoms.
<br>There are weak van der Waals' forces between the adjacent graphene layers in graphite.
<br><br><img alt="quartz_drawing.webp" src="lib/media/quartz_drawing.webp" style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
In a quartz crystal, each silicon is joined to four oxygen atoms by covalent bonds while each oxygen atom is joined to two silicon atoms by covalent bonds.<br>
<br>The giant covalent structure consists of covalent bonds, with overall ration of silicon to oxygen as 1:2. Hence, the chemical formula of quartz is  (empirical formula).
<br><br>They are hard in general. This is because the relative motion of the atoms is restricted by the strong covalent bonds.<br>
<br>However, graphite are relatively soft due to the presence of weak van der Waals' forces between graphene layers.
<br>This relates to the uses of the substances:<br>
<br>Diamond is hard enough to be used to cut stones.
<br>Graphite is used as lubricant and in lead pencils.<br>
The graphene layer can easily slide over each other and leave a black mark.
<br><br>They are mostly poor electrical conductors.<br>
<br>Graphite is a good conductor of electricity. When voltage is applied, the delocalized electrons can move along the layers. It can be used to make electrodes.
<br><br>They are mostly poor heat conductors.<br>
<br>Graphite is a good conductor of heat, as there are delocalized electrons that can collide with each other in its structure.
<br><br>They have high melting points and boiling points in general.<br>
<br>To melt / boil them, lots of heat is required to break the covalent bonds between the atoms.
<br><br>They are insoluble in aqueous solvent and organic solvents.<br>
<br>Substances with giant covalent structure are insoluble in water as the covalent bonds between the atoms and the intermolecular force (hydrogen bond) between water molecules are not of comparable strength.
<br>Substances with giant covalent structure are insoluble in organic solvents as the covalent bonds between the atoms and the intermolecular force (van der Waals' force) between molecules in organic solvent are not of comparable strength

 <br>Hydrogen bonds are a strong intermolecular force formed between a hydrogen atom bonded to highly electronegative atom (e.g. N / O / F) in a molecule and the lone pair electrons from a highly electron negative atom (e.g. N / O / F) in another molecule.<br>Note

<br>Hydrogen bonds are directional in nature and van der Waals’ forces exist between molecules.

<br>Conditions for formation:<br>
<br>The hydrogen atom is bonded to a highly electronegative atom (e.g. N / O / F).
<br>There are lone pair electrons in the highly electronegative atoms (e.g. N / O / F).

<br>Average number of hydrogen bond formation per molecule (more important)<br>
The more hydrogen bond a molecule can form in average, the stronger the hydrogen bond. (It can form more extensive hydrogen bonds.)
<br>Note
To find the average number of hydrogen bonds:

<br>Find the maximum number of hydrogen bonds formed by a molecule.
<br>The smaller number with respect to either the hydrogen atoms or lone pair electrons is the average number of hydrogen bonds.

<br>
<br>Polarity of bond (less important)<br>
When the average number of hydrogen bonds is the same, consider the polarity of bonds. As electronegativity increases from N to O to F, the polarity of bond involving H atom: .
<br><br>Chloroform - <br>
<br>It does not form hydrogen bond between its own molecules, but it forms hydrogen bonds with water.
<br>This is because it has an asymmetrical arrangement of polar bonds of  and  bonds. They make their molecules highly polarized. The hydrogen atom is highly partial positive.
<br>Note
Although  can form hydrogen bond with water, it is not a normal case of formation and is relatively weak compared to normal hydrogen bonds.

 <br><br>Electronegativity is the ability of the atom (of that element) to attract bond pair electrons towards itself.<br>Trends in electronegativity on the Periodic table:<br>
<br>
Electronegativity increases from left to right across a period.<br>
The number of protons in an atom of an element increases from left to right. The effective nuclear charge increases.

<br>
Electronegativity increases from bottom to top across a group.<br>
The number of occupied electron shells decreases from bottom to the top. The bond pair electrons can get closer to the nucleus of the atom of that element and it is more attracted.

<br>
Noble gases do not have electronegativities.<br>
They usually do not form bonds with other atoms.

<br>Note
Atoms of different elements could have the same electronegativities.
<br><img alt="variations_electronegativity.webp" src="lib/media/variations_electronegativity.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>

In diatomic molecules, the molecular polarity is also the bond polarity.

<img alt="h-cl_dipole.webp" src="lib/media/h-cl_dipole.webp" style="width: 180px; max-width: 100%;">
<br>Factors under consideration:<br>
<br>
Presence of polar covalent bonds<br>
The molecule must contain one of more polar bonds for it to be polar.

<br>
Bond polarity symmetry<br>
When polar bonds are arranged symmetrically, the molecule is non-polar.<br>
When polar bonds are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule is polar.

<br>Consider  and :<br>CClClClHCClClClCl<br>
<br>For , it has a tetrahedral structure. The dipole moments of the  and  bonds cannot exactly cancel out. Therefore, it is a polar molecule.
<br>For , it has a tetrahedral structure. The dipole moments of the  bonds exactly cancel out. Therefore, it is a non-polar molecule.
<br>Note
There is net dipole moment in the molecule of . It can be represented with the same symbols as in the case of bond polarity.
<br><br><img alt="polarity_test.webp" src="lib/media/polarity_test.webp" style="width: 450px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Physical test of liquid jet can be used to determine whether a chemical species (liquid) is polar.<br>Procedures:<br>
<br>A sample is added into a burette and allowed to run.
<br>A charge rod is placed close to the liquid jet.
<br>Results:<br>
<br>If the liquid is polar, the liquid jet will be deflected towards the charged rod.
<br>If the liquid is non-polar, deflection does not occur and the liquid jet keeps running as normal.
<br>Polarity of charged rods
A charged rod of either polarity (negative or positive) can be used, as the molecules can rearrange / orientate themselves to face the charged rod with a side of opposite charges to the charged rod.
<br>Induced charges
It is possible for some non-polar liquids to be deflected.
A charged rod induces an instantaneous dipole in the molecule, so the molecules will face in alignment with the electric field of the charged rod.

 <br>Solubility refers to the extent of a solute dissolving in a solvent. Miscibility refers to the extent of two or more liquids to mix well to become a mixture.<br>To determine whether a substance is soluble and miscible, we can compare them with the like-dissolve-like principle.<br><br>Substances will be soluble in / miscible with substance with similar polarity.<br>
<br>Polar substance will be soluble in / miscible with substance with polar substance.
<br>Non-polar substance will be soluble in / miscible with substance with non-polar substance.
<br>Dissolving process:<br>
<br>Substances first undergo partial breaking of their intermolecular force / chemical bond.
<br>New intermolecular force / chemical bond is formed between the original substance and the newly added substance.
<br>Working principle:<br>
<br>If the attraction between the solutes and the attraction between the solvents are of comparable strengths, breaking and reforming of attraction between solutes and solvents are facilitated.
<br>Therefore, when the attraction between the solutes and the attraction between the solvents are of comparable strengths, the solutes tend to be soluble in the solvents.

 <br>Van der Waals' forces is a weak force that forms between molecules.<br><br><br><img alt="hcl_polar_vdw.webp" src="lib/media/hcl_polar_vdw.webp" style="width: 450px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Polar molecules have permanent partial positive and partial negative charges, allowing them to be attracted to an end of another molecule by van der Waals’ forces (dipole-dipole forces).<br><br><img alt="n2_vdw.webp" src="lib/media/n2_vdw.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;"><br>
Non-polar molecules have no permanent partial positive and partial negative charges.<br>However, the random movements of electrons causes an uneven distribution of electrons in atoms of non-polar molecules. This causes the molecule to become polar (the atoms carry partial positive and partial negative charge) instantaneously.<br>This force is also know as dispersion forces / London forces.<br><br>
<br>Molecular size<br>
Molecules with larger molecular size has greater contact surface area with neighbouring molecules.<br>
The strength of van der Waals' forces between molecules of larger molecular size is stronger.
<br>Note
Molecular mass cannot be used for explanation.
<br>
<br>
Polarity of molecules<br>
The strength of van der Waals' forces between polar molecules is stronger than those between non-polar molecules.

<br>
Shape of molecules<br>
When the molecule is more linear in shape (instead of bulky in shape, with many branched chains), the contact surface area between molecules becomes larger (they can pack more regularly). The strength of van der Waals' forces increase.

<br>Shape of molecules and boiling / melting points
<img alt="mpbp_shapes_of_molecules.webp" src="lib/media/mpbp_shapes_of_molecules.webp" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;">

<br>Pentane has a higher boiling point as it is more linear in shape than 2,2-dimethylpropane, the contact surface area between molecules is larger. The strength of van der Waals' forces is higher in liquid state.
<br>2,2-dimethylpropane has a higher melting point as it has a higher packing efficiency than pentane. The strength of van der Waals' forces is higher in solid state.

週末，我和母親去參與農村耕種體驗。
今春雨多，道路泥濘，我挑著一擔秧苗，在溜滑的田埂上走了沒幾步，就心跳加速，雙腿發抖，擔子直晃，只好放下，不知所措地站在那裡。媽媽在田裡插秧，看到我的窘態，大聲地喊:「孩子，外衣脫了，鞋子脫了，再試試!」
我脫了外衣和鞋襪，捲起褲腳，重新挑起擔子。咦，一下子就覺得腳底下穩當了，擔子輕了，很快就把秧苗挑到媽媽跟前。
媽媽說:「你不是沒能力挑這個擔子，你是擔心摔倒，弄髒衣服，注意力不集中。脫掉外衣和鞋襪，就甩掉了多餘的顧慮。」

題目:<br>
鬧市喧嘩，但細心看待卻總有寧靜處，鬧市中尤顯得其寂靜。鬧中有靜，靜以襯鬧，行走匆匆，不妨駐足觀賞，或見人生哲理所在。以「鬧市中寧靜的一角」為題寫作文一篇。

<br>重點: 在鬧市發掘到寧靜的一角，而當中一角落需要詳細寫，如此以熱鬧襯安靜手法來描寫，帶出城市之生命力所在
<br>第一個片段: 先寫鬧市之場景，為後文鋪墊

<br>先寫自己在花市中遊走，觀察所見，人群喧嘩，花農買花，帶出城市熱鬧
<br>抒發生命力所在

<br>第三個片段: 漫步靜謐處

<br>原來一條街隔絕，已然不同，當中除了花店，還有咖啡店，理髮店，士多等等的店鋪，甚有小店情懷，而你駐足其中，且享受一杯咖啡
<br>抒發出城市中有鬧有靜，互相配合，互相點綴，尋覓人間歡騰則可暢遊鬧市中，如喜歡靜謐則可漫步安靜場所


<br>最後立意: 帶出城市熱鬧和安靜並存，單純在於你所選擇生活態度，可享受清歡之樂，也可尋覓那歡騰處

題目:<br>
我們常常看見這樣的畫面:捷運上、飯館裡、電梯上、馬路邊、生活的每一個縫隙都被 手機填滿。朋友聚餐，家人團聚，「低頭族」依舊忙著看微博、聊微信、玩遊戲，就算搭話也是敷衍了事。「低頭族」的隊伍正在壯大，從年輕人到中老年人，甚至小孩子也在加入。「低頭族」源自英文單詞 phubbing，是一個完全被杜撰出來的單詞，由phone (手機) 與 snub (冷落) 組合而成，大意是因玩手機而冷落了周圍的人的行為。20xx年這個詞被收進了 澳大利亞全國大辭典。很顯然，資訊時代的無禮與冷漠正在全球蔓延。結合啟發，以低頭族之我見，寫作文一篇。
<br>
<br>
定義

<br>是因玩手機而冷落了周圍的人的行為


<br>
意義

<br>低頭族會造就人群情感疏離
<br>低頭族會令人難以發掘生活美好
<br>低頭族過於沉溺淺層娛樂，令人思維變得表淺
<br>低頭族更會造就安全隱憂，尤其交通意外


<br>
反思

<br>低頭族建基於科技時代，我們應該適時放下手機，好好與身邊人相處

一位年輕人事業無成非常鬱悶，一天他在海灘上遇到一位老人。老人抓起一把沙子扔在沙灘上，問「你能找到嗎? 」，年輕人說不能。老人又抓起一顆珍珠扔在沙灘上，問「這回呢? 」，年輕人說能。年輕人恍然大悟，一個人，只有做珍珠才能得到別人的認可。試以「價值」為題目寫作文一篇。
<br>題目思維: 歸納寓意<br>
<br>寓意: 求人了解自己，不如努力尋覓自我價值，才能得到他人認可。
<br>文化: 君子病無能焉，不病人之不己知。/ 君子反求諸己。
<br><br><br>一定要通過一個故事帶出從不明白寓意，到最後明白了寓意，帶出君子要懂得迎難而上，反求諸己，才能改善環境，實踐自我價值。當中要不停扣合珍珠和沙子的比喻。<br>
↪️ 圍繞一個故事，超越時間，可判為階段片段法<br><br>
<br>立論: 價值由我創立，要懂得反求諸己，才能實踐自我價值。
<br>如何: 懂得反思自己，即使失敗，也不要歸根他人，才能真正尋覓自我價值。
<br>意義:

<br>敢於做珍珠，改善自我，才能發揮自我價值。
<br>敢於做珍珠，突圍而出，冒上風險，從危險中尋覓機會。


<br>深化:

<br>反思青年人常常推託社會，而不努力改善自身，反而失去機會，難以成功。
<br>「我命由我不由天」，價值獨立存在，依靠自我訂立。

題目:<br>
臺灣女作家劉繼榮在博文上說，她上中學的女兒成績一直中等，但是卻被全班學生全票推選為「最欣賞的同學」，理由是樂觀、幽默、善良、好相處、守信用等。她開玩笑地對女兒說: 「你快要成為英雄了。」女兒卻認真地說:「我不想成為英雄，我想成為坐在路邊鼓掌的人。」<br>
博文引起了廣大線民的熱議。
甲: 坐在路邊鼓掌其實也挺好。<br>
乙: 人人都在路邊鼓掌，誰在路上跑呢?<br>
丙: 路邊鼓掌與路上奔跑，都應該肯定。
試就甲乙丙的說法，談談你的看法寫作文一篇。
<br>
<br>要帶出路邊鼓掌的價值觀，是安於自我步伐，不會理會他人評價，甚或社會名利色權
<br>立論: 路邊鼓掌的人安於自我，反而得到快樂所在。
<br>論點: 路邊鼓掌的人看似消極，其實跟從內心而行，探索自我夢想所在。
<br>論點: 路邊鼓掌的人默默鼓掌，為人們加油吶喊，奉獻自己。
<br>論點: 鼓掌也好，奔跑也好，都是自主選擇，無需過份褒貶。
<br>深化: 懂得為他人鼓掌，位居中間，反而可實踐中庸之道，活得更為快樂。

<br>容貌焦慮

題目:<br>
中國自古有「學而知之」的說法，通常被理解為從師學習。韓愈就說過:「人非生而知之者，孰能無惑? 惑而不從師，其為惑也，終不解矣。」隨著時代的發展，我們獲取知識、掌握技能或懂得道理的途徑日趨多元。請結合你的心得和體驗，在「__而知之」中的橫線處填入一字，構成題目，寫一篇文章。(不能以學而知之為題，其餘皆可以)

圖畫出自唐光雨的漫畫，當中說出練習書法之要點，一筆一劃，一如我們的人生。試就圖畫寓意，寫文章一篇。
<br>圖畫寓意: 人有三個筆法，也比喻人有三個境界。<br>
<br>第一個境界為逆逢起筆，藏而不露，意即默默準備，逆境之中，蓄能待動。
<br>第二個境界為中鋒用筆，不偏不倚。承接第一階段準備足夠後，則順勢用力，恰當出擊。正如人生成年階段，恰當而為，不可用力過猛，方能有所成。
<br>第三境界為停滯迂迴，緩緩出頭。歷經蓄力，用力，此刻終究有所成，大有人間詞話，驀然有所得之境界，可不會氣勢猛烈，而厚積薄發，繩鋸木斷，終究有所成。正如中年階段，有所收穫，智慧和物質有所成。而這個正是一個完整的人格所在。
<br><br>
<br>階段法: 寫出人生三階段，如上。
<br>片段法: 可以寫我在人生不同階段，從求學、尋志、事業中論述自處之道。
<br>議論法: 可以寫出人生三境界，帶出人生之想法。
<br>故事法: 可以寫父親是書法家，從教導書法，帶出人生自處之道。

<br>青少年面對考試，如考試失敗，甚或考試唷暨成功，當中測驗的是成績，更加是意志的堅守。

<br>意義:

<br>測驗成績，也是測驗我們有否盡責
<br>考驗意志，測試我們之初心


<br>自處: 考驗未必針對結果，反而過程給與我們人生智慧

題目:<br>
孤獨是一種心境，是一種美學，更是一次選擇。有人喜歡孤獨，有人卻抗拒孤獨。你對於孤獨有什麼體會，寫作文一篇。
<br>文體
寫法: 負面 → 轉變 → 正面
<br><br><br>
<br>青年時抗拒孤獨，期望得到他人的關懷
<br>成年時接納孤獨，明白人生孤獨之本質，無人可替代完成。
<br>中老年體會孤獨，明白孤獨是常態，反而在孤獨之中咀嚼，反思哲理
<br><br>
<br>物質層面的孤獨，無人陪伴，也無人騷擾，確會寂寞，但反而給我們思考之空間，體會人生。
<br>精神層面的孤獨，無人理解，反而凸顯出自我不同，可創造出不朽之作。<br>
↪️ 例子: 梵高的畫作、李白的性格
<br>道義層面的孤獨，一人獨行，實踐仁義，成後世楷模。<br>
↪️ 文化: 浩然正氣，雖千萬吾往矣的孤獨<br>
↪️ 例子: 孔子
<br><br>
<br>孤而獨之: 物質層面的孤獨，給與思考空間，體會人生哲理
<br>孤而不獨: 思維層面的孤獨，當時無人理解而孤獨，但後世卻得以認同。
<br>獨而不孤: 道義層面的孤獨，當世一人獨行，看似無人理解，實則高潔，一如寒梅獨自「一枝開」<br>
↪️ 例子: 阮籍、竹林七賢<br>
↪️ 文化: 「德不孤，必有鄰」

「一則寓言寫到，一位巴格達商人聽從神的旨意，彎腰撿拾石子，結果石子變成了寶石。其實，彎腰是每個人常有的勞動; 農民彎腰耕作，換來了豐收的喜悅; 清潔工人的彎腰，換來了環境的清潔。彎腰是勞動，是勤勉，是吃苦，是學習。當然，彎腰有時也意味著奴顏婢膝，屈膝投降，丧失人格。」結合上文參考，以「彎腰」為題，寫文章一篇。
<br><br>
<br>需要扣合動作，動作背後意義，投射價值觀
<br>包含正面負面
<br><br><br>
<br>
父母為農民<br>

<br>
上班彎腰<br>
記敘自己日常上班時，從不妥協，到後來彎腰向客人以保持銷量，彎腰向上司以討好對方，最後帶出彎腰利弊參半，是處世價值觀，也是一種無可奈何的退讓。

<br><br><br>
<br>青年彎腰向老師請教問題，彎腰之意義在於謙虛以對，虛心學習
<br>成年彎腰向工作謀求生活，呈現如何彎腰向誰?其意義為一種人世法則
<br>中年彎腰向子女哺育長大，呈現如何彎腰照顧孩子? 意義是無私奉獻的愛
<br>老年彎腰向天命，等待死亡，也看破死亡。呈現自己彎腰過日，但心靈並不彎腰，挺直以對，無懼生死。
<br><br>
<br>定義
<br>正面意義: 請教他人、禮貌之舉、發掘萬物、奉獻自我
<br>負面意義: 為求名利彎腰則不可，諂媚以對權勢也不可
<br>自處: 彎腰向世人是仁者的愛「橫眉冷對千夫指，俯首甘為孺子牛」

成年時過於求成，而令自己心靈扭曲，道德偏差。反而父親慢節奏，從而帶出快未必是好事，慢生活反而令心靈安定，反思人生。<br>
↪️ 帶出開始體會慢活烹調的白粥

<br>
中年時不再求快，開始慢活人生，接受父親粥店。<br>
↪️ 帶出快慢之中，有其節奏，不要被社會節奏主導

<br>
快慢也好，要尋覓自我節奏，且人生悠悠，何須爭一時之快呢?

<br><br>
<br>以叮叮之慢速開始談起慢活人生觀，帶出快捷生活之消極意義 生活節奏，過於求快，不懂放慢，反而得不償失。
<br>事業發展，尋覓應當節奏，求快則品質變差，應慢工出細活。
<br>情感反思，過於求快之節奏，反而失去了人情味，慢節奏促使人們細會情感。
<br>快慢之間，應以慢活為主，活在刻下，尋覓人生美好。
<br><br>
<br>主論: 人生應以慢為主，求快則大事不成。

<br>慎獨處世，可以自律要求自我，繼而成功
<br>慎獨為道德之信念，可從容面對名利
<br>慎獨於社會也有大用，人們懂得慎獨，則可不受法律規管也好，也會堅持道德信念。小至隨地吐痰，大致鑽營走私

我們從小被告知: 只要努力付出，終究會有豐厚的回報。我們中的大多數人也因此體會了收穫的快樂。但是無法回避的是，很多時候，我們努力付出了，但最終還是一無所有。當設想中的一切突然落了空，我們往往無法承受，甚至感到自己被欺騙，感到命運的不公。試以「期望落空」為題目，寫作文一篇。
<br><br><br>可寫自己在放榜時發現自己成績不佳，繼而描寫當日心情，落空的自處，反思和日後之期望。<br><br>
<br>立論: 定義 + 主論
<br>論點: 如何面對期望落空

<br>調整期望，不要過高，才能避免落空。
<br>期望落空後，依舊有所希望，才能改變現實處境。
<br>期望落空不過一時，懂得改善自我，才能日後真正成功。


<br>自處:

<br>懂得可期不可必，義命分立，盡顯自己責任就足夠。


<br><br>Tip
每個階段都要:

<br>寫什麼期望
<br>如何落空
<br>怎麼自處

<br>
<br>青年時面對成績不佳之期望落空，選擇面對失敗，反思自己，重讀以追夢。
<br>成年時面對人生發展不如意之期望落空，選擇安然接納，繼而潛龍勿用，準備自己。
<br>中年時面對子女長大疏離之期望落空，選擇放手不必追，調整期望，尊重對方。
<br>立論: 懂得可期不可必，義命分立，盡顯自己責任就足夠。

太陽和風在爭論誰更有威力。風說:「我來證明我比你行。你看到那兒穿大衣的老頭了嗎? 我打賭我能比你更快地使他脫掉大衣。」於是太陽躲到雲後，風就開始吹起來，愈吹愈大，大到成了一場颶風，但是風吹得愈急，老人把大衣裹得愈緊。終於，風放棄了。然後太陽從雲拮走出來，對老人露出了燦爛的微笑。不久，老人開始擦汗，然後脫掉大衣。太陽對風說:「你看，還是溫和與友善，比憤怒和暴力有威力。」此道理在生活之中依舊貫徹其中，請結合寓意和個人啟發寫作文一篇。
<br>↪️ 寓意: 溫和與友善，比憤怒和暴力有威力，背後暗含了「上善若水，水利萬物而不爭」之道家概念思想，可參考道家概念集。<br><br><br>
<br>立論
<br>對比柔和為何勝卻剛強

<br>個人處世面對人生處境

<br><br>疫情導致創業失敗，本來想要剛硬以對，捲土重來，友人勸說我轉換方法，在網上營銷，運用不同方式得到他人主義，以軟性營銷方法終究得到一片天。最後對比一開始硬性營銷，果然柔和處世之信念，更能突圍而出。]]></description><link>chinese/作文/題二/溫和與友善.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Chinese/作文/題二/溫和與友善.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 16:08:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[拆題]]></title><description><![CDATA[

題目:<br>
蘇格拉底說:「我比別人知道得多的，不過是我知道自己的無知。」<br>
黑格爾說:「無知者是不自由的，因為和他對立的是一個陌生的世界。」<br>
王朔說:「無知者無畏。」<br>
結合上述句子的啟發，以「無知」為題目寫作文一篇。
<br><br>拆題思維: 歸納句子，帶出寓意<br>
<br>蘇格拉底:「承認無知者才能令自己擺脫無知」→「無知者才能接近智慧」
<br>黑格爾:「單純的無知，反而讓人們陷於知識盲點」
<br>王朔:「無知前方危險，赤子之心行事才能有所勇氣，所向披靡。」
<br><br><br>
<br>立論: 無知具有正面意義，但要避免惡性之無知。而無知又分為「真無知」和「假無知」
<br>論點: 單純的無知，反而讓人們陷於知識盲點，此無知是真的無知。
<br>論點: 假無知是敢於承認自己無知，才能令自己勇於學習
<br>論點: 假無知可保護自己，避免世俗之紛爭傷害自己。
<br>論點: 真無知也有其用處所在，在於赤子之心行事才能有所勇氣，所向披靡。
<br>結尾: 要做真無知和假無知之間的人，避免成為知識上無知的人，敢於承認無知才能有知。面對自己所熱愛的事物，不妨做個無知的人，無所畏懼爭取所愛。
<br><br>
<br>第一個層次: 不懂得自己是無知的人
<br>第二個層次: 明白自己的無知，有所反思
<br>第三個層次: 明白自己無知，而慢慢構建自己思維，建立思考體系。
<br>第四個層次: 接近知識時反而發掘出自己更多無知之處，如此反而更能趨向「有知」

我把生命獻給了光明，<br>
在這曙色欲來的前夜，<br>
我把生命獻給了光明。<br>
— 王亞平《燈塔守者》
這兩句詩是《燈塔守者》的最後一節。詩人表面上是指明瞭燈塔守者的工作實質，贊美燈塔守者的奉獻精神: 燈塔守者與黑夜為伴，孤獨地守候著出海人，他給別人送去了光明，卻把整夜的黑暗留給了自己。但在更深層的意義上，這兩句詩又超越了燈塔守者的意義。請結合上文啟發，寫作文一篇。

<br>妻兒子女
<br>身邊人
<br>偉大的志願
<br>黑暗:<br>
<br>自己無止境之付出
<br>犧牲了自己快樂或是生活
<br>燈塔守者:<br>
<br>父母如何奉獻成就子女 → 龍應台、傅雷家書、豐子愷

題目:<br>
「缺憾，也是一種美。」試就此句體會，寫作文一篇。
<br><br><br>
<br>從自己胎記開始寫起，帶出自己抗拒缺憾，到接納缺憾，最後帶出缺憾本來就是一種美所在。
<br>文化思想: 莊子:「天之使其獨也」
<br>類似《隱藏》
<br><br>
<br>人事的缺憾，未必人與人相伴到老，反而給與情感沉澱美。<br>
↪️ 《給美君的信》
<br>世事的缺憾，成敗未必如願，反而給與我們前進的動力
<br>自然的缺憾，突兀的石峰，未必平整，但反而給與我們壯麗之美
<br>對立概念: 人生的缺憾，本質就是一種美，正因為不如願，我們才能感到悔恨、痛苦。這種夾雜著喜怒哀樂的情緒，才是完整的人生。缺乏了這種缺憾，何以帶來美呢?
<br><br>
<br>為何缺憾是一種美: 對立概念下，越大缺憾越大美
<br>缺憾如何是一種美: 不同層次的缺憾造就美
<br>不接納缺憾又會如何?
<br>過於追求工整美，反而遠離了美。
<br>接納缺憾，因其是人生的一部分，反而締造美。

以「肩膀」為題，寫作文一篇。
<br><br><br>
<br>起因: 自己考試失敗，人生無去無從，一心打來電話與我交談。
<br>承接: 見到一心，心中甚為委屈，覺得自己盡力付出卻沒有回報。一心好生安慰，自己忍不住哭泣，其也借肩膀一用，帶出友情反思。
<br>轉折: 一心勸導你，等你可積極面對，包括指出自修之細節，以及人生之規劃，扣合朋友是無形的肩膀，提點我們如何積極面對人生。
<br>立意: 朋一字如同兩個月亮互相依靠，肩膀與肩膀並立，面對人生種種，可無畏無懼，並肩前行。
<br><br>
<br>實在的肩膀: 親情、友情在我們人生之中是有形的依靠。
<br>前人的肩膀: 前人的肩膀即知識根底，讓我們可以看到更多。
<br>仁人志士的肩膀: 仁人志士的肩膀是國家進步之必須，挽救國家既倒之際。如黃花崗大革命，甚或法國革命先頭部隊。
<br><br>
<br>童年時候，父母把我放在肩膀上，日後才知道那是一種溫馨的依靠。
<br>青年時候，考試失敗，依靠在朋友的肩膀，日後才知道是友情無形的慰藉。
<br>成年時候，初識情人，相互依靠，最後結成夫婦，原來肩膀之間相互並立，也是愛情深化之見證。
<br>中年時候，孩子出生，待其長大，將其放在肩膀上，如同小時候，原來肩膀也是親情的傳承。

現象的背後有真相，事物的背後是規律; 成功的背後可能是汗水，榮譽的背後也許是眼淚; 恨的背後難道就不可能是深愛?嚴的背後又何嘗不可以是包容…… 多一種觀察的角度多一道風景。多一個思考的角度多一份深刻。請以《背後》為題作文。

<br><br>
<br>青年時不懂得體察人心，只看表面，不知道人們背後努力。
<br>成年時觀察他人，才見到事物背後之規矩，尤其成功背後犧牲之多難以想 。
<br>壯中年時開始體察世間，反思愛恨背後藏著複雜情緒，帶出世俗成熟之價值觀。
<br>老年開始反思生命背後的意義為何，死亡並非是結束，而是回歸。
<br><br>
<br>定義: 何為背後，表淺的背後，也有深層的背後
<br>如何: 如何探索背後之哲理，可細心觀察事物不同面向、聆聽他人之話語，多角度思考避免單一執念
<br>意義: 了解背後之真相，才能體察世間之喜悲，他人背後之想法。

<br>人生趨向名利，被迫行走，無法停下來。(走之必要)
<br>且放慢腳步，思索人生，不要被社會影響。(停之必要)
<br>停下來是為了走更遠的路，休息之必要。(停與走之關係)
<br>走停之間，各得其適，該走則走，該停則停。(自處一)
<br>停下來細味人生，不要喪失對於生活的享受和人生的思考。(自處二: 遞進到人生)
<br><br>用長短腳的病患貫穿<br>
<br>青年: 遮掩自己長短腳，需要不停休息，不能長時間行走。
<br>成年: 從抗拒長短腳，到後來明白人生無需跟從他人之步伐，安於自我步伐，走停之間，各得其適。
<br>壯年: 明白長短腳是一種天生的缺憾，但是自己卻能比一般人更能細味人生，邊走邊停，休息雙腿，反而更能發現生活的美好。街角之恬靜，生活之美景，人生之細味。
<br>立論: 一開始的放慢腳步而無所適從，到後來安於自我步伐，長短缺憾也好，也是自己人生所在。

沒有昨夜一場暴雨<br>
哪有路上這深深的腳印<br>
風雨中的路人哟，<br>
風雨寫著他的風雨人生<br>
— 葉文福
試就詩詞啟發，以「風雨」為題寫作文一篇。
<br><br><br>
<br>開頭定義風雨: 有形風雨、無形風雨、自處之道
<br>有形風雨給與自然壯美。

<br>雨水灑落在自然山景中，反而添加了朦朧美
<br>雨水洗滌大地後，展露出七彩虹橋。


<br>無形風雨磨煉人的意志

<br>風雨如同挑戰讓我們可以為之砥礪性情，改善自我。
<br>舉出例子，對應例子中風雨之象徵。


<br>無形風雨洗滌人的心靈。

<br>風雨乃人生之跌宕，歷經浮沉後反而得到人生之智慧。
<br>余秋雨《蘇東坡的突圍》最後一段


<br>風風雨雨過後，反而讓我們明白自我。

<br>失敗、跌宕、浮沉終究讓我們為之反思自我，讓自我更加成熟。
<br>季羡林面對文革之事，寫下了《牛棚雜憶》


<br>風雨是人生之必經階段，沒有風雨哪裡有人生之壯麗呢?

<br>哪有路上這深深的腳印

<br>中年時，看到大風大雨想起舊時之事。
<br>青年時，放榜時刻，恰好大風大雨，成績不佳，天公都為我流淚。

<br>風雨之意義給與我們反思，重整自我，繼而出發。


<br>成年時，疫情下被解僱，走出街頭，恰好一陣滂沱大雨，讓我好不狼狽。

<br>風雨之意義磨煉我們意志，讓我們懂得隱忍，且抱持希望熬過去。

六國破滅，非兵不利，戰不善，弊在賂秦。賂秦而力虧，破滅之道也。或曰: 六國互喪，率賂秦耶？曰: 不賂者以賂者喪，蓋失強援，不能獨完，故曰: 弊在賂秦也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
六國的破敗滅亡，不是 (因為他們的) 武器不鋒利，作戰不夠優勝弊端在於 (用土地來) 賄賂秦國。(拿土地) 賄賂秦國而令國力虧損，(這就是) 破敗滅亡的道理。有人問:「六國相繼滅亡，全都是因為賄賂秦國嗎?」(回答) 說:「不賄賂秦國的國家因為有賄賂秦國的國家而滅亡。」原因是不賄賂秦國的國家失掉了強有力的外援，不能獨自保全。所以說:「弊病在于賄賂秦國。」
<br>
<br>
開門見山: 直接提出中心論點 (先破后立)

<br>論點1: 六國相繼滅亡的原因並非在於不擅於作戰、兵器不鋒利
<br>論點2: 以土地賄賂秦國，虧損國力而滅亡


<br>
巧用設問: 提出問題，加以回答

<br>問題: 六國相繼滅亡的原因是否全在於賄賂秦國？
<br>回答: 沒有賂秦國家因有賄賂的國家而滅亡 (論點3)<br>
(失去強大後援 → 無法單獨保存)<br>
↪️ 提出問題再予以駁斥，能保足論點，使其更為完善


<br>
重申論點: 導致破滅的弊端就在於賄賂秦國

<br>作用: 強調論點、結構完整


<br>字詞

<br>破滅: 破敗滅亡
<br>兵: 兵器
<br>利: 鋒利

 <br>反面論述: (沒有賂秦國家: 齊、燕、趙)<br>
<br>沒有割地賂秦也相繼滅亡的原因是「蓋失強援，不能獨完」。
<br>齊國相繼五國滅亡，是因為它與秦國友好而不助五國，最終孤立無援，無法倖免。
<br>燕國因太子丹派荊軻刺殺秦王，招致秦國出兵滅燕；趙國則因良將李牧受誣陷而被誅殺，無法堅持用武。
<br>燕、趙兩國力量單薄，戰敗而亡是在所難免。<br>
↪️ 藉此論證六國滅亡的根本原因是「弊在賂秦」
<br><br>
(a)   齊人未嘗賂秦，終繼五國遷滅，何哉？與嬴而不助五國也。五國既喪，齊亦不免矣。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
齊國不曾賄賂秦國，(可是) 最終也隨著五國滅亡了，為什麼呢? (是因為齊國) 幫助秦國而不幫助其他五國。五國已經减亡了，齊國也就沒法幸免了。
<br>
<br>齊不賂秦而亡<br>
齊國與秦國友好而不幫助五國，最終導致滅亡<br>
↪️ 呼應「蓋失強援，不能獨完」
<br>字詞

<br>嘗: 曾
<br>終: 最終
<br>繼: 跟隨
<br>與: 幫助
<br>助: 幫助
<br>既: 已經
<br>遷滅: 亡國
<br>免: 幸免

<br>手法: 設問
突顯齊國滅亡的根本原因在於依附秦國而不與其餘五國共同抗秦
<br><br>
(b)   燕趙之君，始有遠略，能守其土，義不賂秦。是故燕雖小國而後亡，斯用兵之效也。至丹以荊卿為計，始速禍焉。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
燕國和趙國的國君，起初有長遠的謀略，能夠守住他們的國土，堅持不賄賂秦國的原則。因此燕雖然是個小國，卻後來才滅亡，這就是用兵抗秦的效果。等到後來燕太子丹用派遣荊軻刺殺秦王作對付秦國的計策，這才招致了 (滅亡的) 禍患。
<br>
<br>燕抗秦而亡<br>
↪️ 呼應「非兵不利，戰不善」
<br>字詞

<br>始: 起初
<br>遠略: 長遠的謀略
<br>守: 防守

<br>至: 直至
<br>以: 用
<br>為: 作为
<br>始: 才
<br>速: 加速
<br>禍: 禍患

<br><br>
(c)   趙嘗五戰於秦，二敗而三勝，後秦擊趙者再，李牧連卻之。洎牧以讒誅，邯鄲為郡，惜其用武而不終也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
趙國曾經與秦國交戰五次，打了兩次敗仗，三次勝仗。后來秦國兩次攻打趙國，(趙國大將) 李牧接連打退秦國的進攻。等到李牧因受讒言所害而被殺死，(趙國都城) 邯鄲變成 (秦國的一個) 鄲郡，可惜趙國用武力抗秦而沒能堅持到底。
<br>
<br>趙抗秦而亡<br>
同上，趙亦有深遠的謀略，能守住土地，不賄賂秦国，与秦國交戰勝多敗少

<br>直到猛將李牧受誣陷而死，趙國的首都才最終淪陷<br>
↪️ 呼應「非兵不利，戰不善」


<br>字詞

<br>戰: 交戰
<br>擊: 攻擊
<br>再: 再次
<br>連: 接連
<br>卻: 擊退
<br>洎: 及 / 直至

<br>讒: 讒言
<br>誅: 誅殺
<br>為: 成為
<br>惜: 可惜
<br>武: 武力
<br>終: 最終 / 終結

<br><br>
(d)   且燕趙處秦革滅殆盡之際，可謂智力孤危，戰敗而亡，誠不得已。向使三國各愛其地，齊人勿附於秦，刺客不行，良將猶在，則勝負之數，存亡之理，當與秦相較，或未易量。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
而且燕趙兩國正處在秦國把其他國家改革殲滅得幾乎完結的時候，可以說是智謀窮竭，國勢孤立危急，戰敗了而亡國，確實是不得已的事。假使韓、魏、楚三國都愛惜他們的國土，齊國不依附秦國。(燕國的) 刺客不去 (刺秦王)，(趙國的) 良將李牧還活著，那麼勝敗的命運，存亡的理數，倘若與秦相比較，也許還不容易衡量 (出高低來) 呢。
<br>
<br>
總結燕趟滅亡之因<br>
燕趙處在秦國統一的末期，沒有強力的援軍，滅亡是迫不得以，合理的結果。<br>
↪️ 呼應「不賂者以賂者喪」、「蓋失強援，不能獨完」

<br>
反面設論: 假設三國的情況 (沒有採用錯誤手段、策略)<br>
- 齊國不依附秦國<br>
- 燕國不實行刺殺秦王的策略<br>
- 趟國良將李牧不受讒言所害，依然在世<br>
↪️ 勝負存亡的結果，與秦國比較，便不易估量

 <br>正面論述: (賂秦國家: 韓、魏、楚)<br>
<br>秦國除了用戰爭奪得土地外，還受到其他國家割地賄賂而得到大小城池，由賄賂所得的土地甚至比戰勝所得的更多。
<br>諸國因為割地賂秦而失去的土地比戰敗所失去的更多。因此，諸國的土地一天沒有被秦國吞併，強秦的欲望便永不會滿足。
<br>而割地賂秦， 奉送得愈多，秦國侵犯得越厲害。以地求和，猶如抱薪救火，最終自取滅亡。<br>
↪️ 藉此論證六國滅亡的根本原因是「弊在賂秦」
<br><br>
(a)   秦以攻取之外，小則獲邑，大則得城，較秦之所得與戰勝而得者，其實百倍；諸侯之所亡與戰敗而亡者，其實亦百倍。則秦之所大欲，諸侯之所大患，固不在戰矣。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦國除了用戰爭奪取土地以外，小的就獲得邑鎮，大的就獲得城池。比較秦國受賄賂所得到的土地，與戰勝別國所得到的土地，實際多百倍。六國諸侯所喪失的土地，與戰敗所喪失的土地相比，實際也要多百倍。那麼秦國最想要的，與六國諸侯最擔心的，本來就不在于戰爭。
<br>
<br>
對比論證: 秦國以戰勝與受賄所得土地

<br>指出秦國靠戰勝而贏得的土地和受賄賂得到的土地數量，兩相比較之下，受賄賂得到的土地比戰勝得到的多出百倍 (誇張)
<br>帶出收受賄賂對秦國而言不必損失兵力資源，又能得到豐厚回報，是不勞而獲地享有暴利的方法


<br>
對比論證: 六國因戰敗所失與賂秦所失土地

<br>兩相比較之下，賂秦而損失的土地也比戰敗而損失的多出百倍 (誇張)
<br>帶出賂秦對六國而言會平白無故地造成無謂的土地、資源損失，是自取滅亡，得不償失的方法


<br>
總結申論 (呼應「非兵不利，戰不善，弊在賂秦」)

<br>秦國最想要的並非發動戰爭，而是藉由威脅迫六國割地求和，坐享其成
<br>諸侯最大的問題並非不善於作戰，而是平白無故地割地求和，造成國力虧損。


<br>字詞

<br>以: 因為
<br>攻取: 战爭侵佔
<br>則1: 就
<br>邑: 小城邑
<br>城: 大城都
<br>較: 相較 / 比較
<br>之: 的
<br>則2: 那麼
<br>忠: 憂忠
<br>固: 本來
<br>戰: 作戰

<br>手法: 對比論證

<br>突顯大國割地求和的做法極度不智，為了避免戰爭造成的損失，而負上了比戰敗更多的成本，更令秦國得以無損地獲得百倍土地。

<br><br>
(b)   思厥先祖父，暴霜露，斬荊棘，以有尺寸之地。子孫視之不甚惜，舉以予人，如棄草芥。今日割五城，明日割十城，然後得一夕安寢，起視四境，而秦兵又至矣。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
想到他們的祖輩和父輩，暴露在寒霜雨露中，披荊斬棘，才有了很少的一點土地。子孫對那些土地卻不很愛惜，全都拿來送給別人，就像扔掉小草 (一樣不珍惜)。今天割讓五座城，明天割讓十座城，這才能得到一夜安穩的睡眠。明天起床一看四周邊境，秦國的軍隊又來臨了。
<br>
<br>對比論證: 六國祖先與現世子孫對待土地的態度

<br>祖先們歷經千辛萬苦才得到尺寸之地，所以非常珍惜
<br>子孫將土地拱手送人，將土地視作草芥，毫不珍惜
<br>以此比較論證諸侯不孝與不智的賂秦行為實在不恰當


<br>字詞

<br>思: 想念
<br>厥: 他們的
<br>先: 先人
<br>暴: 冒着
<br>斬: 斬斷
<br>以: 才
<br>尺寸之地: 很小的土地
<br>視: 對待 / 看待
<br>惜: 珍惜
<br>不甚: 不怎樣
<br>舉: 全部
<br>予: 給予
<br>如: 就像
<br>棄: 拋棄 / 丟棄
<br>草芥: 小草
<br>割: 割讓
<br>一夕: 一个晚上
<br>安寢: 安穩的睡眠
<br>起: 起床
<br>視: 視察
<br>四境: 四周的邊境
<br>兵: 軍隊
<br>至: 到来

<br>手法: 對比論證

<br>突顯大國後代子孫的不孝，甘願將先輩苦苦打下的江山拱手相讓。
<br>以諸侯國割地事秦的頻率之高對比諸國能得安寧的時日之短，說明割地事秦的效果微乎其微，更顯諸國的不智。
<br>以有限的土地對比慾望的無窮，論證出以地事素不能從根本解決問題的觀點。

<br><br>
(c)   然則諸侯之地有限，暴秦之欲無厭，奉之彌繁，侵之愈急，故不戰而強弱勝負已判矣。至於顛覆，理固宜然。古人云︰「以地事秦，猶抱薪救火，薪不盡，火不滅。」此言得之。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
但諸侯的土地有限，暴戾的秦國的慾望不會滿足，(諸侯) 送給他的越多，他侵犯得就越急劇。所以用不著作戰，誰強誰弱，誰勝誰負就已經分明了。到了覆滅的地步，道理本來就是這樣子的。古人說:「用土地侍奉秦國，就好像抱柴救火，木柴不燒完，火焰就不會熄滅。」這話說出其中的道理。
<br>
<br>
比喻論證、引用論證: 抱薪救火之論

<br>引用古人蘇代之言，論證以土地賄賂秦國，就像抱著木柴救火，賄賂得越多，秦國野心就越大，不能達預期求和目的
<br>形象化地表明以地賂秦是不當手段，只會導致大國滅亡
<br>總結全段的論調:「賂秦之弊」


<br>
總結申論: 指出賂秦的行為只能換取短暫的安穩，無法平穩秦國的野心，更會助長秦國的氣焰

<br>賂秦的土地越多，侵略的次數也会越頻繁

夫六國與秦皆諸侯，其勢弱於秦，而猶有可以不賂而勝之之勢；茍以天下之大，而從六國破亡之故事，是又在六國下矣！<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
六國和秦國都是諸侯之國，他們的勢力比秦國弱，卻還有可以不賄賂秦國而戰勝它的優勢。如果憑借偌大國家，卻追隨六國滅亡的前例，這就比不上六國了。
<br>

<br>透過六國賂秦的下場告誡北宋君主應當抵抗外敵，而非採取求和的策略
<br>若北宋再步六國之後塵，則連大國也比不上

<br>六國是分裂的諸侯國，尚且有和秦國的一戰之力
<br>北宋海內統一，天下共主

嗚呼！以賂秦之地，封天下之謀臣；以事秦之心，禮天下之奇才；並力西嚮，則吾恐秦人食之不得下嚥也。悲夫！有如此之勢，而為秦人積威之所劫，日削月割，以趨於亡。為國者無使為積威之所劫哉！<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
唉! (如果六國諸侯) 用賄賂秦國的土地來封給天下的謀臣，用待奉秦國的心來禮遇天下的超卓人才，齊心合力地向西 (對付秦國)，那麼，我恐怕秦國人飯也不能咽下去，真可悲啊! 有這樣的有利形勢，卻被秦國積久的威勢所脅迫，天天割地，月月割地，以至于走向滅亡。治理國家的人不要被積久的威勢所脅迫啊!

君臣語: 委婉恭敬，不卑不亢 (子對皇帝的勸諫)

先帝創業未半，而中道崩殂。今天下三分，益州疲敝，此誠危急存亡之秋也！然侍衞之臣，不懈於內；忠志之士，忘身於外者，蓋追先帝之殊遇，欲報之於陛下也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
先帝 (劉備) 開創帝業還未到一半，卻中途駕崩了，如今天下分成了三個國家，我們蜀國最為疲弱困乏，這是非常危急，決定存活敗亡的時刻呀！但是皇上的左右大臣對內政勤勉不懈怠，忠於國家的將士，忘卻性命，不怕犧牲地對外作戰，都是因為追念先帝對他們的思德，希望報答在陛下的身上。
<br>分析蜀國形勢:<br>
<br>不利形勢: 先帝未完成統一大業中途逝世，且天下三分而蜀國最弱

<br>國家陷入群龍無首的情況，管治失去明確方針
<br>蜀國國力最弱，魏、吳雨國虎視耽耽，意圖侵略吞併

君子說：學習不可以停止。青色是從藍草中提煉出來的，而這靛青的顏色比原本的藍草更青。冰是由水凝固而成的，但冰的溫度比水還要冷。像繩子測量般直的木頭，加熱屈曲成為車輪，合乎圓規的程度，雖然再有枯乾暴曬，也不會回復筆直的樣子，是加熱使它成為這樣。所以木頭被繩子校正後就會筆直，金屬被磨刀石磨過後就變得鋒利。君子要廣泛學習，每天反省自己，這樣才能有智慧高明並且行事無過失。
<br>
<br>
中心論點: 學習不可以停止

<br>呼應<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="勸學/第三段" data-href="勸學/第三段" href="chinese/十二篇範文/勸學/第三段.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">第三段</a>: 需要不斷學習才能積累知識


<br>
學習意義

<br>以青色、寒冰作比喻，指出學習足以改變本性，由惡變善，更讓內在的潛質得以彰顯，以成就高尚的人格。
<br>以火烘烤筆直、符合繩墨的木材，使其屈曲成圓輪，暴曬後也不會恢復作比喻，指出人經過後天學習可以懂得行善，而且不會再行惡。
<br>以木材經過墨繩校正就會筆直，刀劍經過磨刀石的打磨就會鋒利作比喻，指出廣泛學習，常自我省察，方可以成為智慧高明，行為没有過錯的君子。

積土成山，風雨興焉；積水成淵，蛟龍生焉；積善成德，而神明自得，聖心備焉。故不積跬步，無以至千里；不積小流，無以成江海。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
累積土可以成為山，就會興起風雨；累積水可以成為淵，蛟龍就在淵裡生出來；積累善行可以成為德行，自然得到智慧，具備聖人的精神境界。所以不積累每半步，就無法達到千里之遙；不積累小水流，就無法成為江海。
<br>
<br>泥土堆積成高山可以令風雨興起、積存水源而成的深淵可孕育蚊龍作比喻，正面描述學習重在累積。

<br>類比論證一個人多做好事，便能養成崇高的品德，具備聖人的思想境界。


<br>以不累積半步的步伐，無法走出千里之遠，不累積細小的水流，無法形成大江大海，反面論述不累積就無法達成遠大的目標。
<br>字詞

<br>成1: 形成
<br>成2: 養成
<br>神明: 智慧
<br>備: 具備
<br>跬步: 半步
<br>至: 到達

<br><br>
騏驥一躍，不能十步；駑馬十駕，功在不舍。鍥而舍之，朽木不折；鍥而不舍，金石可鏤。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
駿馬一躍不能到達十步的距離；縱使是質素低劣的馬，憑着十日的努力，也可以完成駿馬的行程，只要不放棄，就能完成壯大的成就。若半途而廢，即使是朽木也不會斷裂；堅持不放棄，金石也可以雕刻。
<br>騏驥、駑馬:<br>
<br>駿馬一次跳躍不能有十步之距比喻天資優秀而不願意努力的人。
<br>鈍馬走十日可以出行千里比喻資質愚笨而願意努力耕耘的人。
<br>↪️ 對比論證學習要鍥而不捨，方能有成，後天努力比天賦更重要。<br>朽木、金石:<br>
<br>進行雕刻工作時堅持能夠把金屬石頭刻成，比喻堅持不懈學習而有所成。
<br>放棄則連腐朽的木材也不能刻成，比喻學習時放棄而無所成。
<br>↪️ 對比論證學習時持之以恆方能有成。<br>字詞

<br>騏驥: 駿馬
<br>駑馬: 劣馬
<br>十駕: 十日路程
<br>舍: 捨棄
<br>朽木: 腐爛的木
<br>折: 折斷

螾無爪牙之利，筋骨之強，上食埃土，下飲黃泉，用心一也。蟹六跪而二螯，非蛇蟺之穴無可寄託者，用心躁也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
蚯蚓沒有利用爪牙的優勢，沒有堅韌的筋骨，在上面吃細土，在下面喝地底深處的水，這是一心努力的表現。蟹雖然有六隻腳及兩只鉗子，但如果沒有蛇和鱔魚的洞穴，就無處寄居，是因為心性浮躁。
<br>蚯蚓、螃蟹:<br>
<br>以蚯蚓比喻專心一致的人，螃蟹比喻作浮躁難安的人。
<br>蚯蚓雖無爪牙和銳牙，缺乏挖掘泥土的客觀條件，卻能憑着用心專一，而得以吞食泥土和飲用地下泉水，論證專心致志，方能將勤補拙。
<br>螃蟹雖有六隻腳和兩隻鉗子，能力理應較強，卻因浮躁不專心，而只能寄居在蛇、鱔的洞穴，論證用心浮躁會阻礙學習。
<br>↪️ 對比論證以突顯學習時用心專注的重要。<br>字詞

<br>螾: 蚯蚓
<br>利: 銳利
<br>強: 強韌
<br>埃土: 土壤

吾嘗終日而思矣，不如須臾之所學也；吾嘗跂而望矣，不如登高之博見也。登高而招，臂非加長也，而見者遠。順風而呼，聲非加疾也，而聞者彰。假輿馬者，非利足也，而致千里；假舟楫者，非能水也，而絕江河。君子生非異也，善假於物也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
我曾經終日思索，但和片刻的學習比起來，思索的效果並不如學習來得好。我曾經踮起腳跟遠望，但卻不如登高遠眺看得更廣闊登上高處招手，並非手臂更加長，但能讓更遠的人看見。向順風呼叫，聲音雖然沒有加大，但令人能更清楚聽見。乘馬的人，不是因為自己走得快，卻能達到千里之外；乘船及使用船槳的人，不是因為自己擅長游泳，卻能夠橫渡江河。君子的天賦並非異於常人，只是善於借助外在的條件。
<br>
<br>
學習方法

<br>以終日空想没有行動 (踮高腳遠望) 對比片刻的學習 (登上高處博覽風景)，指出整天思索，比不上片刻的學習，只要肯學習，就能解決問題，有所得益。
<br>以登上高處招手、順著風向呼喊，借助車輛以及舟艇船隻作比喻，指出學習時借助外物，可收事半功倍之效。


<br>
統合申論，指出君子的本性沒有與人不同，只是善於借助外物。借助學習亦可修養品德，成為君子。

<br>字詞

<br>嘗: 曾經
<br>須臾: 片刻
<br>跂: 踮高腳

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
自從我成為有罪的人，住在這個州裡，就常常恐懼不安，如有閒置時間，就慢慢地行走，無拘束地遊玩。每日和那些同伴，上高山，入深林，走到曲折溪流的盡頭。幽僻的泉水，奇異的石頭，沒有一處個遠的地方不曾到過。

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
到了目的地就撥開草而坐下，倒盡壺中酒直至醉倒。醉了就互相枕籍著睡覺，睡覺了就做夢。心中想到達某個地方，夢境也會走到那裡，睡醒了就起來，起來了就回家。我以為凡是這個州的山有奇特形狀的，我都遊覽過了，可是我還未曾知道西山怪異特別的景色。

<br>

(a)   今年九月二十八日，因坐法華西亭，望西山，始指異之。遂命僕過湘江，緣染溪，斫榛莽，焚茅茷，窮山之高而止。攀援而登，箕踞而遨，則凡數州之土壤，皆在衽席之下。其高下之勢，岈然窪然，若垤若穴，尺寸千里，攢蹙累積，莫得遯隱。縈青繚白，外與天際，四望如一。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
今年九月二十八日，我因為坐在法華寺西亭，眺望西山，才指點著覺得它奇特，於是命令僕人渡過湘江，沿著染溪，砍伐荊棘，焚烧亂草，窮盡善山之巔才停下。我們攀援登上山頂，隨意坐下觀賞，附近幾個州的土地，就全在我們的坐席之下了。這幾州的地勢高低不平，廣闊深邃的地區像小土堆、低下凹陷的地方像蟻穴。延綿千里的景物被收縮至尺寸之間，這些景物聚集收攏、層層累積，沒有一處能逃出視野，隱藏起來。青山白水互相繚繞，外沿與天邊相接。向四面望去都是一樣的景象。
<br>
<br>
交代發現西山的緣由<br>
在法華西亭眺望，才發現西山的奇特

<br>
描述前往西山的經過

<br>前往過程: 渡過湘江，沿著染溪，砍伐荊棘，焚烧亂草，窮盡善山之巔才停下，攀援登上山頂
<br>間接描寫: 突顯西山的偏僻險峻、路途的艱辛困難<br>
(對比「施施」、「漫漫」)
<br>運用動詞，語氣和意思連貫且一氣呵成


<br>
描寫西山之巔所見

<br>俯瞰附近數州群山，不論高矮，山丘和山谷就像土堆和蟻穴，千里之內的是物都盡收眼底，以像山堆和蟻穴的山脈襯托西山的高聳，突顯西山是附近最高的山峯
<br>遠眺青山白水，發現它們與天相連，四周的景色廣曠浩瀚，渾然一體，突顯西山景觀的壯觀宏大 (間接描寫)


<br>字詞

<br>因: 因為

<br><br>
(b)   然後知是山之特出，不與培塿為類。悠悠乎與顥氣俱，而莫得其涯；洋洋乎與造物者遊，而不知其所窮。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
登山後才知這座山的特別突出，與小土丘不一樣。它是如此的宏大浩瀚啊，像是與天地間的大氣相合，而沒有邊際；它是如此的廣大無涯啊，像是與大自然一同遊玩，而不知道盡頭。
<br>觸景生情，對西山的讚歎與個人油然而生的感悟:<br>
<br>讚歎西山的獨特出眾，有別於普通的沙堆土丘，孤高超群

<br>寄喻自身特立的獨行，不流於世俗，所以也不應執著於虛無庸俗的得失，對「培塿」的平凡庸俗一類感到厭惡


<br>在西山與天地浩氣同遊，頓悟大自然的宏大浩瀚與自身的渺小

<br>流露脫俗超然，不染凡塵的意志
<br>表達登臨後心境開闊，為下文體會作鋪墊


<br>字詞

<br>培塿: 小土丘
<br>悠悠乎: (心境) 遼闊浩渺地
<br>俱: 同在
<br>洋洋: 廣大無涯的樣子

<br><br>
(c)   引觴滿酌，頹然就醉，不知日之入。蒼然暮色，自遠而至，至無所見，而猶不欲歸。心凝形釋，與萬化冥合。然後知吾嚮之未始遊，遊於是乎始，故為之文以志。是歲元和四年也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
我們拿起酒杯斟滿酒，暢懷痛飲，進入醉態，甚至不知太陽下了山，灰暗的暮色，由遠而至，直到什麼都看不見還不想回去，心神得以凝定、形體得以解脱，與自然界萬物不知不覺地融為一體。然後才知我以前不曾真正遊賞過，真正遊賞是從這裡開始的，所以我把這次西山之遊寫成文章以記載下來，這一年是元和四年。
<br>
<br>
描寫宴飲情形

<br>開懷暢飲至醉倒，連日落也沒有察覺，即使天色昏暗，視野欠奉也不願歸去
<br>與先前的宴飲對比，突顯西山之遊的分別，作者不再是徒有其表，而是樂在其中，呼應「始」的主題


<br>
抒發遊西山的個人體會

<br>心神因為看到西山壯闊的景色而豁然開朗，達至「天人合一、物我兩忘」的境界，忘卻了世間一切得失，渾然忘憂，被貶謫的鬱悶不安都拋諸腦後


<br>
交代作記原因

 <br>
慶曆四年春，滕子京謫守巴陵郡。越明年，政通人和，百廢具興。乃重修岳陽樓，增其舊制，刻唐賢、今人詩賦於其上；屬予作文以記之。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
慶曆四年春天，滕子京降職到岳州出任太守。到了第二年，政務順利，百姓和樂，各種荒廢了的事業都重新興辦起來了。於是重新修建岳陽樓，擴展它原有的規模，把唐代名人家和今人的詩賦刻在上面，並囑咐我寫一篇文章來記述這件事。
<br>
<br>
交代背景<br>
指出滕子京被貶謫至巴陵郡，一年後政策通明，人們樂也融融，於是決定重修岳陽樓。

<br>
交代重修情況<br>
按岳陽樓舊有的規模增建，並刻上唐代先賢和當世名人的詩詞歌賦。

<br>
交代作記緣由<br>
指出是滕子京囑咐自己為重修岳陽樓一事作記。

<br>字詞

<br>謫: 貶謫
<br>守: 出任太守
<br>越: 到了
<br>通: 順利
<br>和: 和樂
<br>具: 都
<br>興: 興旺
<br>乃: 於是
<br>增: 增建
<br>制: 規模
<br>刻: 雕刻
<br>屬: 囑咐
<br>予: 我
<br>記: 記錄

第一段<br>
予觀夫巴陵勝狀，在洞庭一湖。銜遠山，吞長江，浩浩湯湯，橫無際涯；朝暉夕陰，氣象萬千。此則岳陽樓之大觀也，前人之述備矣。然則北通巫峽，南極瀟湘，遷客騷人，多會於此，覽物之情，得無異乎?<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
我看那巴陵郡的優美的景色，就在洞庭湖之中。洞庭湖包含遠方的山脈，吞吐著長江的流水，浩浩蕩蕩，寬闊仿佛得沒有盡頭。早上陽光燦爛，晚上暮氣陰沉，景物的變化無窮無盡。這就是岳陽樓雄偉壯麗的景象。前人對這些景象的記述已經很完備了。既然如此，這裡北面通向巫峽，南面最遠可以到達潇水、湘江，被降職遠調的官吏和失意落魄的詩人，大多在這裡聚集，觀賞這裡的自然景物而觸發的感情，是不是有差異呢?
<br>
<br>
描寫岳陽樓的總體景觀

<br>點出巴陵郡的美景全部位於洞庭湖，指出洞庭湖連接遠方的山巒，吞吐長江江水，水勢洶湧，湖面廣闊無邊。
<br>「朝暉夕陰，氣象萬千」— 指出早晚的天氣變化多端，總括文章的下兩段。
<br>以前人已詳細描述記載岳陽樓的景觀，把焦點拉回在岳陽樓身上，為寫景部分作結。


<br>
指出岳陽樓位於交通要地，匯集眾多來往的人們

<br>「遷客騷人」: 呼應上文滕子京被貶謫一事
<br>「覽物之情」: 開啟下文，指出登岳陽樓的心情各異


<br>字詞

<br>夫: 那
<br>勝: 美好的
<br>狀: 景色
<br>銜: 含着
<br>吞: 吞納
<br>浩浩湯湯: 水勢浩蕩洶湧
<br>橫: 廣闊
<br>際涯: 邊際
<br>朝: 早上
<br>暉: 陽光燦爛
<br>夕: 傍晚
<br>陰: 天色陰沉
<br>則: 就是
<br>大觀: 盛大壯觀的景象 / 大概的景觀
<br>述: 描述
<br>備: 完備
<br>然則: 那麼
<br>通: 通往
<br>極: 直達
<br>遷客: 被貶謫的官吏
<br>騷人: 詩人 / 失意的文人
<br>會: 聚集
<br>得無: 能夠沒有
<br>異: 差異
<br>乎: 嗎

<br>手法: 承上啟下

<br>承接上文寫岳陽樓因地理位置優越而看到的壯觀景象
<br>開啟下文分別寫不同天氣下的景色和遷客騷人觀賞景物時所產生的不同感情

第二段<br>
若夫霪雨霏霏，連月不開；陰風怒號，濁浪排空；日星隱耀，山岳潛形；商旅不行，檣傾楫摧；薄暮冥冥，虎嘯猿啼。登斯樓也，則有去國懷鄉，憂讒畏譏，滿目蕭然，感極而悲者矣。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
像那連綿細雨紛紛而下，連續數個月不放晴的時候，陰冷的風怒吼著，渾濁的波浪衝向天空；日月星辰隱藏起光輝，山嶽也隱沒了形跡；商人和旅客無法通行，桅杆倒下，船槳折斷；接近傍晚時分天色昏暗，只聽到老虎的吼叫和猿猴的悲啼。這時登上這座樓，就會產生被離開京城，懷念家鄉，擔心被說壞話而害怕被譏諷，再抬眼望去盡是蕭條冷落的景象，一定會感慨萬千而十分悲傷了。
<br>
<br>
描寫岳陽樓陰沉然的景色

<br>指出陰雨連綿的日子裏，接連數月不放晴
<br>陰冷的狂風怒號，渾濁的浪濤衝上天空
<br>太陽和繁星都隱沒了光芒，山嶽都潛藏了形跡
<br>受到天氣影響，商人旅客都不能通行，船隻都被摧毀
<br>傍晚天色昏暗，老虎、猿猴在咆嘯、啼叫


<br>
從景色中產生覽物而悲之情

<br>情感:

<br>被貶謫而離開國都 (京城)、思念故鄉的情緒
<br>既擔憂被讒言誹謗，又害怕被惡意譏諷
<br>放眼都是蕭條頹然的景致，難免感歎至極，心生悲哀


<br>這種憂慮愁緒是對自身的，藉此帶出下文與憂國憂民的分別
<br>為「不以物喜，不以己悲」埋下伏筆 (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Chinese/十二篇範文/岳陽樓記/第五段" data-href="Chinese/十二篇範文/岳陽樓記/第五段" href="chinese/十二篇範文/岳陽樓記/第五段.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">第五段</a>)

第三段<br>
至若春和景明，波瀾不驚，上下天光，一碧萬頃；沙鷗翔集，錦鱗游泳，岸芷汀蘭，郁郁青青。而或長煙一空，皓月千里，浮光躍金，靜影沉璧；漁歌互答，此樂何極! 登斯樓也，則有心曠神怡，寵辱皆忘，把酒臨風，其喜洋洋者矣。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
到了春風和煦，陽光明媚的時候，湖面平靜，沒有驚濤駭浪，天色湖光相連，一片碧綠，廣闊無際；沙洲上的白鷗，時而飛翔，時而聚集，色彩斑斕的魚兒或浮或沉；岸上的小草，小洲上的蘭花，散發香氣而生長茂盛。有時湖面上的大片煙霧完全消散，皎潔的月光映照千里的景色。有時浮動的月光閃著金色，有時靜靜的月影像沉在水中的玉璧。漁夫們愉快地唱歌，又互相應和著彼此。這種樂趣哪裡會有極點呢？這時登上這座樓，就會感到胸懷開闊，精神愉快，榮寵和屈辱一併忘了，面對清風拿起酒杯痛飲，那心情真是高興極了。
<br>
<br>
描寫岳陽樓清新怡人的景色

<br>指出春暖明媚的日子裏，湖面波平如鏡
<br>天空和湖水相互映照，湖水一片碧綠，彷彿像有萬頃一樣廣闊
<br>沙鷗在飛翔、聚集棲息，美麗的魚兒在湖中暢游
<br>岸邊的芷花、沙洲上的蘭花色彩鮮艷、香氣濃郁
<br>有時候空中的水氣消散，千里的景物都被皓月照耀
<br>月光在湖面上像金線一樣躍動，平静的月影像沉在湖底的白玉
<br>漁民通過歌聲一唱一和，樂趣、快樂彷彿沒有盡頭


<br>
從景色中產生覽物而喜之情

<br>情感:

<br>心境開朗、精神舒暢喜悅
<br>個人的榮辱得失一掃而空，拋諸腦後
<br>迎風暢飲，心情愉快、悠然自得


<br>藉由喜樂的心情反襯滕子京被貶謫

<br>對偶: 「沙鷗翔集，錦鱗游泳」為對偶句，上下兩句對稱均勻，讀起來琅琅上口，而且意思相關，使事物形象更加鮮明。

第四段<br>
嗟夫! 予嘗求古仁人之心，或異二者之為。何哉？不以物喜，不以己悲。居廟堂之高，則憂其民；處江湖之遠，則憂其君。是進亦憂，退亦憂，然則何時而樂耶? 其必曰：「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」歟! 噫! 微斯人，吾誰與歸!<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
唉﹗我曾經探求古時品德高尚的人的思想感情，他們或許不同於以上兩種心情，這是什麼緣故呢?是因為古時品德高尚的人不因外物好壞和自己得失而或喜或悲。在朝廷做官就為百姓憂慮；不在朝廷做官而處在僻遠的江湖中間就為國君憂慮。這樣他們進入朝廷做官也憂慮，退處江湖也憂慮。雖然這樣，那麼他們什麼時候才快樂呢? 他們一定會說「在天下人憂愁之前先憂愁，在天下人快樂以後才快樂」吧? 唉! 如果沒有這種人，我又可以和誰在一起呢?
<br>呼應上文，提出中心論點:<br>
<br>指出古時賢達仁者的志向遠大、品德高尚，與上述覽物而喜、悲不同

<br>不因為外在環境、個人際遇而感到快樂、悲傷
<br>不論加官進爵、身處高位，還是流放偏隅、地位卑微，都會憂國憂民。

<br>藉此勸勉滕子京 / 呼應上文「遷客騷人」


<br>以百姓福祉為一切先決，希望先於百姓憂慮，後於百姓快樂。


<br>藉古時賢達仁者的志向勸勉自身，以其為榜樣，抒發敬佩之情
<br>勉勵同遭貶謫的滕子京不要灰心，應堅守抱負。
<br>字詞

<br>嘗: 曾經
<br>求: 探求
<br>或: 或許
<br>異: 不同
<br>為: 表現

<br>物: 外物變化

<br>其: 古仁人
<br>歟: 吧
<br>噫: 唉
<br>微: 沒有
<br>斯: 這樣的
<br>歸: 效法、依歸

<br>手法: 對比

<br>描寫雨天時景色陰沉、危機處處，帶出眼前景物令遷客騷人聯想到路途險峻，前途黯淡，觸發思鄉之情和被讒言中傷的憂慮。
<br>描寫晴天時景色優美、生氣盎然，令遷客騷人心曠神怡、精神舒暢喜悅，個人的榮辱得失因景色一掃而空，拋諸腦後。

<br>手法: 反襯

<br>遷客騷人情緒易受自己的際遇和身處的環境影響
<br>遇到陰暗的風雨天，他們會擔心自己被人中傷或譏笑而感到悲傷; 在晴朗平靜的日子，他們又會拋卻榮辱，樂而忘憂
<br>古仁人不論在朝廷身居高位，或退隱在民間，都只會憂國憂民，他們的悲喜皆因國事，不受自己的際遇和身處的環境影響
<br>作者以遷客騷人的平凡表現襯托古仁人超凡脫俗的高尚情操

第五段<br><br>滕子京 &amp; 范仲淹

<br>范仲淹當時被貶，但沒有氣餒，效法「古仁人」的積極態度，無論是否在朝為官，也要關心國家百姓，不為個人得失而悲喜
<br>滕子京亦被貶，仍努力令百姓生活安穩，以天下為己任，行事以百姓為先，不因為外在環境影響情緒
<br>政治抱負:「居廟堂之高則憂其民，處江湖之遠則憂其君」、「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂」

<br>遷客騷人 &amp; 古仁人

<br>遷客騷人:

<br>憂慮自己會否遭人誣陷中傷
<br>情緒會受外在環境和個人際遇牽動影響
<br>停留在個人得失層次的考量


<br>古仁人:

<br>無論身處何地、自身的境況，都為百姓和君主憂心
<br>在朝廷當官，時刻為百姓的福祉而擔憂
<br>身在民間，無法為君主出謀獻策，憂心君主的施政是否周全
<br>先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂

慶曆四年春，滕子京謫守巴陵郡。越明年，政通人和，百廢具興。乃重修岳陽樓，增其舊制，刻唐賢、今人詩賦於其上；屬予作文以記之。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
慶曆四年春天，滕子京降職到岳州出任太守。到了第二年，政務順利，百姓和樂，各種荒廢了的事業都重新興辦起來了。於是重新修建岳陽樓，擴展它原有的規模，把唐代名人家和今人的詩賦刻在上面，並囑咐我寫一篇文章來記述這件事。
<br>

若夫霪雨霏霏，連月不開；陰風怒號，濁浪排空；日星隱耀，山岳潛形；商旅不行，檣傾楫摧；薄暮冥冥，虎嘯猿啼。登斯樓也，則有去國懷鄉，憂讒畏譏，滿目蕭然，感極而悲者矣。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
像那連綿細雨紛紛而下，連續數個月不放晴的時候，陰冷的風怒吼著，渾濁的波浪衝向天空；日月星辰隱藏起光輝，山嶽也隱沒了形跡；商人和旅客無法通行，桅杆倒下，船槳折斷；接近傍晚時分天色昏暗，只聽到老虎的吼叫和猿猴的悲啼。這時登上這座樓，就會產生被離開京城，懷念家鄉，擔心被說壞話而害怕被譏諷，再抬眼望去盡是蕭條冷落的景象，一定會感慨萬千而十分悲傷了。
<br>
<br>
描寫岳陽樓陰沉然的景色

<br>指出陰雨連綿的日子裏，接連數月不放晴
<br>陰冷的狂風怒號，渾濁的浪濤衝上天空
<br>太陽和繁星都隱沒了光芒，山嶽都潛藏了形跡
<br>受到天氣影響，商人旅客都不能通行，船隻都被摧毀
<br>傍晚天色昏暗，老虎、猿猴在咆嘯、啼叫


<br>
從景色中產生覽物而悲之情

<br>情感:

<br>被貶謫而離開國都 (京城)、思念故鄉的情緒
<br>既擔憂被讒言誹謗，又害怕被惡意譏諷
<br>放眼都是蕭條頹然的景致，難免感歎至極，心生悲哀


<br>這種憂慮愁緒是對自身的，藉此帶出下文與憂國憂民的分別

予觀夫巴陵勝狀，在洞庭一湖。銜遠山，吞長江，浩浩湯湯，橫無際涯；朝暉夕陰，氣象萬千。此則岳陽樓之大觀也，前人之述備矣。然則北通巫峽，南極瀟湘，遷客騷人，多會於此，覽物之情，得無異乎?<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
我看那巴陵郡的優美的景色，就在洞庭湖之中。洞庭湖包含遠方的山脈，吞吐著長江的流水，浩浩蕩蕩，寬闊仿佛得沒有盡頭。早上陽光燦爛，晚上暮氣陰沉，景物的變化無窮無盡。這就是岳陽樓雄偉壯麗的景象。前人對這些景象的記述已經很完備了。既然如此，這裡北面通向巫峽，南面最遠可以到達潇水、湘江，被降職遠調的官吏和失意落魄的詩人，大多在這裡聚集，觀賞這裡的自然景物而觸發的感情，是不是有差異呢?
<br>
<br>
描寫岳陽樓的總體景觀

<br>點出巴陵郡的美景全部位於洞庭湖，指出洞庭湖連接遠方的山巒，吞吐長江江水，水勢洶湧，湖面廣闊無邊。
<br>「朝暉夕陰，氣象萬千」— 指出早晚的天氣變化多端，總括文章的下兩段。
<br>以前人已詳細描述記載岳陽樓的景觀，把焦點拉回在岳陽樓身上，為寫景部分作結。

 <br>
古之學者必有師。師者，所以傳道、受業、解惑也。人非生而知之者，孰能無惑？惑而不從師，其為惑也終不解矣。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
古代求學的人一定有老師。老師，就是傳授道理、 講授學業、解答疑問的人。人不是生下來就懂得道理的，誰能沒有疑惑？有疑惑卻不跟從老師學習， 那些疑難問題就始終不能解開了。
<br>
<br>
托古立論、開門見山 (從師傳統)

<br>古代師道盛行，凡是學習的人必有老師


<br>
老師的職責

<br>傳授道理 (儒家道統)
<br>講授課業 (儒家經典)
<br>解答疑惑 (求學或為人的困惑)


<br>
老師的重要性

<br>人不是天生就懂得所有知識，要依靠老師解答疑惑，否則疑惑就無法解開


<br>字詞

<br>古：古代
<br>學者: 學習的人
<br>師: 老師
<br>傳道: 傳授道理
<br>受業: 講授課業
<br>解惑: 解答疑惑
<br>非: 不是
<br>生: 出生
<br>知: 懂得道理
<br>孰: 誰
<br>惑: 疑惑
<br>從師: 跟從老師學習
<br>為: 成為 / 作為
<br>終: 始終
<br>解: 解開

<br>手法

<br>反問: 人非生而知之者，孰能無惑？

第一段<br>
生乎吾前，其聞道也，固先乎吾，吾從而師之；生乎吾後，其聞道也，亦先乎吾，吾從而師之。吾師道也，夫庸知其年之先後生於吾乎？是故無貴無賤，無長無少，道之所存，師之所存也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
出生在我之前的人，他懂得道理本來就比我早，我就跟從他，拜他為師；出生在我之後的人，如果他懂得的道理也比我早，我也跟從他，拜他為師。我學習的是道理啊，豈用理會他的年齡比我大還是比我小呢？所以無論地位高貴還是低幾，無論年長還是年輕，道理存在的地方，就是老師所在的地方。
<br>
<br>擇師原則

<br>年齡: 不需理會年長或年幼
<br>地位: 不需理會地位高貴或低賤
<br>道理: 學問深厚，懂得的道理比自己多為首要


<br>字詞

<br>生: 出生
<br>前: 之前
<br>聞: 懂得
<br>道: 道理
<br>固: 本來
<br>先: 早
<br>從: 跟從
<br>師1: 拜他為師
<br>後: 之後
<br>師2: 學習
<br>庸: 豈 / 難道
<br>知: 理會
<br>年: 年齡
<br>先後: 比我大還是小
<br>是故: 因此 / 所以
<br>無: 不管 / 無論
<br>貴: 高貴
<br>賤: 卑賤
<br>長: 年長
<br>少: 年輕
<br>存: 存在
<br>師3: 老師

<br>手法

<br>對偶: 生乎吾前，其聞道也，固先乎吾，吾從而師之；生乎吾後，其聞道也，亦先乎吾，吾從而師之。

第二段<br>
嗟乎！師道之不傳也久矣！欲人之無惑也難矣！古之聖人，其出人也遠矣，猶且從師而問焉；今之眾人，其下聖人也亦遠矣，而恥學於師。是故聖益聖，愚益愚，聖人之所以為聖，愚人之所以為愚，其皆出於此乎！<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
唉！從師求學的風氣已經失傳很久了!希望人們沒有疑惑也很難了！古代的聖人，他們天賦超出一般人很多，尚且跟從老師學習。現在的眾人，他們相比聖人還差得很遠，卻以向老師學習感到羞恥。所以聖人就更加聖賢，愚昧的人就更加愚昧。聖人能夠成為聖人的原因，愚昧的人仍然是愚昧的人的原因，大概都是出於這樣的原因吧？
<br>
<br>對比：古之聖人 / 今之眾人 (不同時代的人的對比)

<br>古代聖人資質優異尚且從師學習
<br>現今眾人資質愚笨卻恥於從師
<br>結果: 聖人更為聖明，愚人更為愚昧
<br>批評: 古今對比，概歎師道失傳，批評世人恥於從師，突顯從師學習是區分聖愚的關鍵


<br>「師道不傳」的原因

<br>
不明白老師的職責在於傳授道理、解決疑惑<br>
自己不會從師學習，即使擇師教子，老師也只着重教授書本知識和句讀<br>
↪️ <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Chinese/十二篇範文/師說/第四段" data-href="Chinese/十二篇範文/師說/第四段" href="chinese/十二篇範文/師說/第四段.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">第四段: 擇師教子</a>

<br>
誤把年紀、地位視為擇師的標準<br>
取笑從師的人，把從師視為羞恥，不知道只要領會道理，就可從師<br>
↪️ <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Chinese/十二篇範文/師說/第五段" data-href="Chinese/十二篇範文/師說/第五段" href="chinese/十二篇範文/師說/第五段.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">第五段: 百工之人</a>


<br>字詞

<br>嗟乎: 唉
<br>師道: 從師學習的風氣
<br>傳: 傳揚 / 盛行
<br>欲: 想要
<br>惑: 疑惑
<br>難: 困難
<br>出: 超出 / 超過
<br>遠: 很遠
<br>猶且: 尚且
<br>從: 跟從
<br>問: 請教
<br>下: 低於 / 不如
<br>恥: 羞恥
<br>聖: 高明
<br>益: 更加
<br>愚: 愚昧
<br>其: 大概

<br>手法

<br>對比論證: 突顯尊師重道、從師學習是區分重愚的關鍵。

第三段<br>
愛其子，擇師而教之；於其身也，則恥師焉，惑矣！彼童子之師，授之書而習其句讀者，非吾所謂傳其道、解其惑者也。句讀之不知，惑之不解，或師焉，或不焉，小學而大遺，吾未見其明也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
一些人愛護自己的兒子，選擇老師來教兒子，而自己卻把從師學習視為羞恥。實在是糊塗呀！那些孩子的老師，是教給小孩子文句基本知識的人，而不是我所說傳授道理、解答疑難問題的老師。不懂文辭停頓，會向老師學習；疑難不解，卻不向老師請教。小問題願意從師學習，大道理卻遺漏忽略，我看不出他的明智之處。
<br>
<br>對比：擇師教子 / 自己從師 (事情輕重的對比)

<br>人們因為愛惜子女而精心挑選老師來教導，對於自身卻認為從師學習是羞恥，不願從師 → 自相矛盾
<br>人們認為句讀有必要從師學習，卻忽略老師更重要的職能是傳授道理、解決疑惑 → 捨本逐末
<br>結果: 小學問 (句讀) 學會了，大道理卻遺漏、忽略


<br>字詞

<br>愛: 愛護
<br>擇: 選擇
<br>教: 教授
<br>於: 對於
<br>恥: 羞恥
<br>惑: 糊塗
<br>彼: 那
<br>句讀: 文辭停頓處
<br>解: 解答
<br>知: 明白
<br>解: 理解
<br>或: 有的
<br>師: 從師學習
<br>不: 不願學習
<br>小: 小學問
<br>學: 從師學習
<br>大: 大道理
<br>遺: 遺漏 / 忽略
<br>明: 明智

<br>手法

<br>對比論證: 突顯人們恥於從師的不智、本末倒置。

第四段<br>
巫、醫、樂師、百工之人，不恥相師；士大夫之族，曰師、曰弟子云者，則羣聚而笑之。問之，則曰︰「彼與彼年相若也，道相似也。」位卑則足羞，官盛則近諛。嗚呼！師道之不復，可知矣。巫、醫、樂師、百工之人，君子不齒，今其智乃反不能及，其可怪也歟！<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
巫覡、醫師、樂師、各種工匠，不把互相學習當作羞恥；士大夫一類的人，聽到叫「老師」、「弟子」 等稱呼時，就聚在一起來嘲笑。詢問他們原因，他們就說:「某人與某人的年齡差不多，學問也相近。」拜地位低的人為師實在羞恥，拜地位高的人為師則接近於諂媚奉承。啊！從師學習的風氣不能恢復的原因是可以知道的。巫覡、醫師、樂師、 各種工匠，士大夫不屑與他們並列，現在士大夫的才智反不如他們，這真是奇怪！
<br>
<br>對比：百工之人 / 士大夫之族 (社會不同階層)

<br>巫醫等職業的下層人民願意互相學習，士大夫卻恥於從師並嘲笑從師學習的人

<br>認為向地位低的人學習實在羞恥，向地位高的人學習則是奉承
<br>結果: 士大夫地位尊崇，才智卻不及地位低微的人 (奇怪)
<br>批評: 呼應上文擇師的準則，指出士大夫根據年齡、地位來嘲笑他人從師，批評他們膚淺，不明事理的心態，更藉此批評當時社會輕視師道的不良歪風




<br>字詞

<br>恥: 羞恥
<br>相: 互相
<br>師: 學習
<br>族: 類
<br>曰: 說
<br>云: 稱呼
<br>者: 的人

<br>相若: 差不多

<br>位: 地位
<br>卑: 低下 / 卑賤
<br>足: 十分
<br>羞: 羞恥
<br>官: 官位
<br>盛: 高級
<br>近: 接近
<br>諛: 諂媚 / 奉承
<br>師道: 從師學習的風尚
<br>不復: 不可恢復
<br>可知: 可以知道
<br>君子: 士大夫
<br>不齒: 不屑
<br>智: 才智
<br>乃: 竟 / 居然
<br>及: 及得上

<br>手法

<br>對比論證: 突顯地位尊卑和智力高低成反比的奇怪現象。

第五段<br>
聖人無常師，孔子師郯子、萇弘、師襄、老聃。郯子之徒，其賢不及孔子。孔子曰︰「三人行，則必有我師。」是故弟子不必不如師，師不必賢於弟子；聞道有先後，術業有專攻，如是而已。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
聖人沒有固定的老師，孔子曾拜郯子、萇弘、師襄、 老聃為師。郯子這些人，他們的賢明比不上孔子。 孔子說:「幾個人走在一起，其中一定有可以作為我學習對象的人。」因此學生不一定不如老師，老師不一定比學生賢明，懂得道理有早有晚，學問技藝各有專長，就是這樣罷了。
<br>
<br>
從師多人 (事例)

<br>呼應「古之學者必有師」、「道之所存，師之所存也」
<br>這些人的德行都比不上孔子，指出聖人沒有固定的老師
<br>論證道理: 老師不一定要比學生賢明才能作為老師，並非只有特定的對象才可以擔當老師，只要有優秀於自己的地方就值得向其學習


<br>
能者為師 (語例)

<br>孔子自身乃聖人之姿，賢明通達，依然認為身邊有值得自己學習的對象

<br>原因: 懂得道理有分先後，不同的技術有專門研究


<br>論證道理: 老師不一定要比學生賢明才能作為老師，並非只有特定的對象才可以擔當老師，只要有優秀於自己的地方就值得向其學習

<br>呼籲世人打開胸襟，廣泛虛心學習，不要恥於從師




<br>字詞

<br>常: 固定
<br>師: 以……為老師
<br>徒: 這些人
<br>賢: 賢明 / 高明
<br>三人: 幾個人
<br>行: 走在一起 / 同行
<br>則: 就
<br>是故: 所以
<br>不如: 不及
<br>賢於: 比……高明
<br>聞道: 懂得道理 
<br>先後: 早晚
<br>專攻: 專門研究
<br>如是: 就是這樣

<br>手法

<br>舉例論證: 論證選擇老師的原則只在於「道」，不在於年齡、地位尊卑，而老師也不一定要比學生賢明才能作為老師。
<br>引用論證: 論證「能者為師」的道理，只要人們身上有比自己更優秀的地方，就應該向他學習。

第六段<br><br>
李氏子蟠，年十七，好古文，六藝經傳，皆通習之，不拘於時，學於余。余嘉其能行古道，作《師說》以貽之。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
李家有個孩子叫蟠，年齡十七歲，喜歡古文，六經的經文和傳文，全都通曉學習了，他不受時俗的拘束，向我學習。我讚許他能夠遵行古人從師學習的風氣，所以寫作這篇《師說》來贈送他。

巫覡、醫師、樂師、各種工匠，不把互相學習當作羞恥；士大夫一類的人，聽到叫「老師」、「弟子」 等稱呼時，就聚在一起來嘲笑。詢問他們原因，他們就說:「某人與某人的年齡差不多，學問也相近。」拜地位低的人為師實在羞恥，拜地位高的人為師則接近於諂媚奉承。啊！從師學習的風氣不能恢復的原因是可以知道的。巫覡、醫師、樂師、 各種工匠，士大夫不屑與他們並列，現在士大夫的才智反不如他們，這真是奇怪！
<br>
<br>對比：百工之人 / 士大夫之族 (社會不同階層)

<br>巫醫等職業的下層人民願意互相學習，士大夫卻恥於從師並嘲笑從師學習的人

<br>認為向地位低的人學習實在羞恥，向地位高的人學習則是奉承
<br>結果: 士大夫地位尊崇，才智卻不及地位低微的人 (奇怪)
<br>批評: 呼應上文擇師的準則，指出士大夫根據年齡、地位來嘲笑他人從師，批評他們膚淺，不明事理的心態，更藉此批評當時社會輕視師道的不良歪風

聖人無常師，孔子師郯子、萇弘、師襄、老聃。郯子之徒，其賢不及孔子。孔子曰︰「三人行，則必有我師。」是故弟子不必不如師，師不必賢於弟子；聞道有先後，術業有專攻，如是而已。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
聖人沒有固定的老師，孔子曾拜郯子、萇弘、師襄、 老聃為師。郯子這些人，他們的賢明比不上孔子。 孔子說:「幾個人走在一起，其中一定有可以作為我學習對象的人。」因此學生不一定不如老師，老師不一定比學生賢明，懂得道理有早有晚，學問技藝各有專長，就是這樣罷了。
<br>
<br>
從師多人 (事例)

<br>呼應「古之學者必有師」、「道之所存，師之所存也」
<br>這些人的德行都比不上孔子，指出聖人沒有固定的老師
<br>論證道理: 老師不一定要比學生賢明才能作為老師，並非只有特定的對象才可以擔當老師，只要有優秀於自己的地方就值得向其學習


<br>
能者為師 (語例)

<br>孔子自身乃聖人之姿，賢明通達，依然認為身邊有值得自己學習的對象

<br>原因: 懂得道理有分先後，不同的技術有專門研究


<br>論證道理: 老師不一定要比學生賢明才能作為老師，並非只有特定的對象才可以擔當老師，只要有優秀於自己的地方就值得向其學習

<br>呼籲世人打開胸襟，廣泛虛心學習，不要恥於從師




<br>字詞

<br>常: 固定
<br>師: 以……為老師
<br>徒: 這些人
<br>賢: 賢明 / 高明
<br>三人: 幾個人
<br>行: 走在一起 / 同行
<br>則: 就
<br>是故: 所以
<br>不如: 不及
<br>賢於: 比……高明
<br>聞道: 懂得道理 
<br>先後: 早晚
<br>專攻: 專門研究
<br>如是: 就是這樣

<br>手法

<br>舉例論證: 論證選擇老師的原則只在於「道」，不在於年齡、地位尊卑，而老師也不一定要比學生賢明才能作為老師。
<br>引用論證: 論證「能者為師」的道理，只要人們身上有比自己更優秀的地方，就應該向他學習。

愛其子，擇師而教之；於其身也，則恥師焉，惑矣！彼童子之師，授之書而習其句讀者，非吾所謂傳其道、解其惑者也。句讀之不知，惑之不解，或師焉，或不焉，小學而大遺，吾未見其明也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
一些人愛護自己的兒子，選擇老師來教兒子，而自己卻把從師學習視為羞恥。實在是糊塗呀！那些孩子的老師，是教給小孩子文句基本知識的人，而不是我所說傳授道理、解答疑難問題的老師。不懂文辭停頓，會向老師學習；疑難不解，卻不向老師請教。小問題願意從師學習，大道理卻遺漏忽略，我看不出他的明智之處。
<br>
<br>對比：擇師教子 / 自己從師 (事情輕重的對比)

<br>人們因為愛惜子女而精心挑選老師來教導，對於自身卻認為從師學習是羞恥，不願從師 → 自相矛盾
<br>人們認為句讀有必要從師學習，卻忽略老師更重要的職能是傳授道理、解決疑惑 → 捨本逐末
<br>結果: 小學問 (句讀) 學會了，大道理卻遺漏、忽略

<br>學: 從師學習
<br>大: 大道理
<br>遺: 遺漏 / 忽略
<br>明: 明智

<br>手法

<br>對比論證: 突顯人們恥於從師的不智、本末倒置。

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
趙惠文王在位時，得到楚國的和氏璧。秦昭王聽聞這個消息後，就派人送给趙王一封書信，表示願意用十五座城池來換取和氏璧。趙王和大將軍廉頗以及眾多大臣商議說：「想把和氏璧交予秦國，卻害怕得不到秦國的城池，徒然被欺騙;想不交予和氏璧，又害怕秦國的士兵前來攻打。計謀尚未議定，徵求可以作為使者去答覆秦國的人，卻又未有合適的人選。宦官頭目繆賢便說：「我的門客藺相如可作為使者。」

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
趙王問道：「為何知道他適合擔任？」繆賢回答說：「我曾經犯罪，私下打算要從趙國逃亡到燕國。我的門客藺相如阻止我說：『你為何知道燕王會收留你？』我告訴他說：『我曾經跟從大王與燕在趙國的邊境上會面，燕王私下握着我的手，說：「願意與你結為朋友。」因此我知道燕王會收留我，所以想前往燕國。』相如對我說：『趙國強大而燕國弱小，那時你得到趙王的恩寵，所以燕王才想和你結交。現在你是從趙國逃亡至燕國，燕國畏懼趙國，燕王必定不敢收留你，反而一定將你綁起來交給趙國。你不如赤身伏在斧質 (一種刑具) 上，請求降罪。』我跟從他的計策，幸好大王亦赦免了我。我個人認為他是個勇士，有智慧謀略，適合派他出使。

② (c)   於是王召見，問藺相如曰：「秦王以十五城請易寡人之璧，可予不？」相如曰：「秦彊而趙弱，不可不許。」王曰：「取吾璧，不予我城，奈何？」相如曰：「秦以城求璧而趙不許，曲在趙；趙予璧而秦不予趙城，曲在秦。均之二策，寧許以負秦曲。」王曰：「誰可使者？」相如曰：「王必無人，臣願奉璧往使。城入趙而璧留秦；城不入，臣請完璧歸趙。」趙王於是遂遣相如奉璧西入秦。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
於是趙王便召見藺相如，問他說：「秦王以十五城請求換取我的和氏璧，可以交予嗎？」相如說：「秦國強大而趙國弱小，不能不答應。」趙王說：「取得我的壁玉，卻不給我城池，應該怎樣做？」相如說：「秦國用城池來求取璧玉而趙國不答應，這是趙國理虧；趙交予璧玉而秦國不交予城池，這是秦國理虧。衡量這兩個對策，寧願答應將璧玉給予秦國，令它負上理虧的責任。」趙王「說：「誰人可以擔當使者？」相如曰：「大王果真沒有人可以任用的話，我願意捧着和氏璧去出使秦國。要是城池劃入趙國的版圖，那麼我就讓璧玉留在秦國；要是城池不能劃入趙國版圖，那麼微臣請求把壁完完整整地帶回趙國。」趙王於是便派遣相如捧上璧玉向西進入秦國。

③ (a)   秦王坐章台見相如，相如奉璧奏秦王。秦王大喜，傳以示美人及左右，左右皆呼萬歲。相如視秦王無意償趙城，乃前曰：「璧有瑕，請指示王。」王授璧，相如因持璧，卻立，倚柱，怒髮上衝冠，謂秦王曰：「大王欲得璧，使人發書至趙王，趙王悉召羣臣議，皆曰：『秦貪，負其彊，以空言求璧，償城恐不可得』。議不欲予秦璧。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦王坐在秦宮章台 (秦宮名) 中召見相如。相如奉上和氏璧獻給秦王。秦王十分高興，傳給秦王的妃子、宮女和左右侍從觀賞，左右侍從全都高呼萬歲。相如看到秦王沒有意圖償付趙國城池，於是上前說：「和氏璧上有瑕疵，請讓我指示給大王你看。」秦王便授予相如璧玉，相如就拿着璧玉退後站着，倚靠着柱子，憤怒得頭髮直豎，好像衝起了帽子。向秦王說：「大王想得到和氏璧，派使使者發送書信給趙王，趙王召集全部臣子商議，他們全都說：『秦國貪心，恃着它的強大，用空口白話來求取璧玉，償付的城池恐怕不能得到。』商議不想交予秦國璧玉。

③ (b)   臣以為布衣之交尚不相欺，況大國乎！且以一璧之故逆彊秦之驩，不可。於是趙王乃齋戒五日，使臣奉璧，拜送書於庭。何者？嚴大國之威以修敬也。今臣至，大王見臣列觀，禮節甚倨；得璧，傳之美人，以戲弄臣。臣觀大王無意償趙王城邑，故臣復取璧。大王必欲急臣，臣頭今與璧俱碎於柱矣！」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
我以為平民百姓交往尚且不會互相欺騙，何況是偌大的國家呢？而且因為一塊壁的緣故而拂逆了強秦的歡心，這是不可以的。於是趙王便齋戒五日，派使我捧着壁玉，在朝廷上行禮，送出國書。為甚麼呢？因為尊重你大國的威嚴而表達敬意呀！如今我到達這裏，大王你接見我於一般宮殿中，禮節十分傲慢;得到和氏壁後，傳遞給妃子、客女，用來戲弄我。我觀察大王沒有意圖償付趙王城池，所以我重新取回璧玉。大王必定想逼迫我，我的頭顱今天就和壁玉一起撞碎在柱子上吧！」

③ (c)   相如持其璧睨柱，欲以擊柱。秦王恐其破璧，乃辭謝固請，召有司案圖，指從此以往十五都予趙。相如度1秦王特以詐佯為予趙城，實不可得，乃謂秦王曰：「和氏璧，天下所共傳寶也。趙王恐，不敢不獻。趙王送璧時，齋戒五日，今大王亦宜齋戒五日，設九賓於廷，臣乃敢上璧。」秦王度2之，終不可彊奪，遂許齋五日，舍相如廣成傳。相如度1秦王雖齋，決負約不償城，乃使其從者衣褐，懷其璧，從徑道亡，歸璧於趙。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
相如手持璧玉斜視柱子，想用來撞擊柱子。秦王恐怕他破壞璧玉，於是婉言道歉，堅決請求藺相如不要這樣做。召喚管理版圖的官吏按着地圖，指着從這裏到那裏十五個城都給予趙國。相如估計秦王只是特意以狡詐的話裝作要給趙國都城，實際其不可以得到，於是向秦王說:「和氏壁，是大家公認的寶物。趙王懼怕秦國，不敢不獻出壁玉。趙王送出璧玉時，齋戒了五日，如今大王也應當齋戒五日，在宮廷上設九賓之禮，臣才敢獻上壁玉。」秦王揣度情況，認為終歸不能以粗野的手段奪取，於是答應齋戒五日，並把相如安置在廣成賓館。相如估計秦王雖然答應齋戒，但一定違約不償行城池，於是命令他的隨從穿着粗布便衣，懷中藏着璧玉，由小路逃走，將璧玉送歸趙國。

④ (a)   秦王齋五日後，乃設九賓禮於廷，引趙使者藺相如。相如至，謂秦王曰：「秦自繆公以來二十餘君，未嘗有堅明約束者也。臣誠恐見欺於王而負趙，故令人持璧歸，間至趙矣。且秦彊而趙弱，大王遣一介之使至趙，趙立奉璧來；今以秦之彊而先割十五都予趙，趙豈敢留璧而得罪於大王乎？臣知欺大王之罪當誅，臣請就湯鑊。唯大王與羣臣孰計議之！」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦王齋戒五日後，便在宮廷上設九賓之禮，引見趙國的使者藺相如。相如來到，向秦王說：「秦國自謬公以來有二十幾個君主，未曾有堅守信約的君主。我真的恐怕被大王欺騙而辜負趙國，所以每人帶着壁玉歸去，已從偏僻的小路回到趙國了。而且秦國強大而趙國弱小，大王只需派遣一個「使者前往趙國，趙國立刻奉上壁玉過來。現在憑着秦國的強大而且先割讓十五座城池交予趙國，趙國怎麼膽敢保留璧玉而得罪大王呢？我知道欺瞞大王的罪行應該被誅殺，我請受湯錢之刑。希望大王和眾多臣子考慮商議一下！」

④ (b)   秦王與羣臣相視而嘻。左右或欲引相如去，秦王因曰：「今殺相如，終不能得璧也，而絕秦趙之驩，不如因而厚遇之，使歸趙，趙王豈以一璧之故欺秦邪！」卒廷見相如，畢禮而歸之。相如既歸，趙王以為賢大夫，使不辱於諸侯，拜相如為上大夫。秦亦不以城予趙，趙亦終不予秦璧。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦王與眾多臣子互相對望而發出又驚又怒的聲音。左右有人想拉相如出去治罪，秦王於是說：「今殺相如，終究不能得到壁玉，而且會斷絕了秦國與趙國的友好關係，不如就此優厚地招待他，讓他返回趙國，趙王怎會因為一塊璧玉的緣故而欺騙我們秦國呢？」終於在宮廷上召見相如，完成外交禮節，然後送他歸去。相如回到趙國，趙王認為他勝過一般的大夫，出拜使諸侯之國能不受欺辱，便拜封相如為上大夫。結果秦國亦沒有將城池给予趙國，趙國亦終究沒有交予秦國壁玉。

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦王派遣使者告訴趙王，他想與趙王示好，希望在西河外的濾池會面。趙王畏懼趙王，想不去。像鮪、蘭相如推斷說:「大王你不前去的話，就代表軟弱而且怯懦了。」趙王於是前去，相如隨行。廉頗護送趙王到邊境上，與趙王告別說:「大王這次出行，估計從路上行走一直到會面的禮節完畢，然後返回，不會超過三十日。如果三十日也不回來，就請大王允許我們擁立太子為王，以斷絕秦國 (扶持趙王來要脅) 的野心。」大王答允這個請求，便和秦王在渑池會面。

秦王飲酒到高興的時候，說：「我私下聽聞趙王愛好音律，請你彈奏瑟。」趙王便彈起了瑟。秦國的史官上前用筆寫道：「某年月日，秦王與超王會而飲酒，命令趙王彈奏瑟。」藺相如上前說：「趙王私下聽聞秦王擅長演奏秦國的音樂，請允許我獻上盆规给秦王敲擊，讓大家娛樂。」秦王聽到後大怒，不答應。於是相如上前獻上盆蛾，就跪在地上請求秦王。秦王不願意敲擊盆纸。相如說：「五步之內，我相如可以把頭血濺在大王身上了！」左右侍從想用刀刺相如，相如張開雙眼叱喝他們，侍從都害怕得退卻下來。於是秦王不高興地為趙王敲了一下盆纸。相如叫來趙國的史官用筆寫道：「某年月日，秦王為趙王敲擊盆紙。」

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦國的眾多臣子說：「請以趙國的十五座城池為秦王慶賀。」藺相如亦說：「請以秦國的首都成陽為趙王慶賀。」秦王的酒筵完畢，始終不能在氣勢上勝過趙國。趙國也大規模集結士兵來防範秦國，秦國不敢輕舉妄動。

⑥ (a)   既罷歸國，以相如功大，拜為上卿，位在廉頗之右。廉頗曰：「我為趙將，有攻城野戰之大功，而藺相如徒以口舌為勞，而位居我上，且相如素賤人，吾羞，不忍為之下。」宣言曰：「我見相如，必辱之。」相如聞，不肯與會。相如每朝時，常稱病，不欲與廉頗爭列。已而相如出，望見廉頗，相如引車避匿。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
會面完畢後回到趙國，趙王認為相如的功勞最大，拜封他作為上卿，職位在廉頗之上。廉頗說：「我作為趙國的將軍，有攻取城池在野外血戰的大功，而難相如只是憑言詞立下功勞，職位卻居於我之上，而且相如本來是出身卑賤的人，我感到羞恥，不能忍受自己的職位在他之下。」宣揚說：「我遇見相如，必定會羞辱他。」相如聞言，不肯與他會面。相如每逢上朝時，經常說自己生病，不想與廉頗爭論官位的高低。過了些時候，相如出行時遠遠望見廉頗，相如調轉車行方向躲避他。

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
於是相如的門客前來進練說：「我之所以離開親戚付奉你的原因，只是仰慕你的崇高品德。如今你與廉颇職位並列，廉頗宣揚狠惡的言論而你卻害怕躲避他，恐懼得太過分了，而且平常人尚且會感到羞恥，何況身為將相的人呢？我們沒有才能，請讓我們辭去吧。」藺相如堅決阻止他們，說：「你看廉頗將軍與秦王相比，誰比較厲害？」門客說：「不及秦王。」相如說，「憑秦王的威势，而我也敢在他的宮廷袁叱喝他，羞辱他眾多臣子，我藺相如雖然愚鈍無能，難道就只怕爆將軍嗎？

⑥ (c)   顧吾念之，彊秦之所以不敢加兵於趙者，徒以吾兩人在也。今兩虎共鬥，其勢不俱生。吾所以為此者，以先國家之急而後私讎也。」廉頗聞之，肉袒負荊，因賓客至藺相如門謝罪。曰：「鄙賤之人，不知將軍寬之至此也。」卒相與驩，為刎頸之交。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
但我想到，強秦之所以不敢發兵攻打趙國，只因有我們兩人在啊。如今兩虎相門，其形勢結果必定不能並存。我之所以這樣做，是把國家的急務為先，而把個人的私怨為後。」廉頗聽聞後，光着身子，背着荊條，藉着賓客作引導到蘭相如門前謝罪。說：「我這個見識短淺的人，不知道將軍你寬宏大量到這個地步。」終於二人和好，結誓同生死的好友。

 <br><br>精簡: 秦王希望得到和氏璧，提出以十五城池作交換，藺相如為此出使秦國。<br>出使秦國前

<br>趙惠文王在位時，得到舉世聞名的和氏璧
<br>秦國聽聞後想據為己有，便派使者前來通報願意用十五座城池來換取寶玉
<br>趙王和群臣得知消息後，陷入既害怕秦王貞約，又擔憂秦兵來犯的困境

<br>以此鋪墊藺相如的登場，並以群臣的無能襯托相如的賢明能幹


<br>此時宦官頭目繆賢引薦藺相如，以自己曾經被相如阻止畏罪潛逃至燕國的經歷

<br>指出相如有勇有謀，能夠勝任出使秦國的使者


<br>其後趙王召見相如，對談間相如向越王分析形勢，並自薦出使，承諾若得不到秦國的城池，必定「完璧歸趙」

<br>趙王因此信任相如，派使他出使秦國



<br><br>精簡:<br>
<br>藺相如把和氏璧獻到秦王手上，但從秦王的態度看出他沒有誠意以十五城池作交換
<br>便藉口璧上有瑕疵，要求檢查一下以取回氏璧
<br>再暗中派人把璧送回趙國，並表示任憑秦王處置
<br>相如視死如歸的態度折服了秦王，於是讓他返回趙國
<br>初見秦王

<br>秦王坐在偏殿章台接見相如

<br>章台是登臨遊樂的地方，秦王不在正殿進行接見，反映他輕視相如


<br>秦王接過壁玉，顯得十分高興，將壁玉傳給妃子、宮女以及侍從觀賞

<br>反映秦王已將壁玉當作己有，態度傲慢


<br>相如看出秦王無意償付城池，便謊稱壁玉有瑕疵，要指示給秦王看

<br>以此取回壁玉，奪回主導權


<br>相如取得壁玉後，怒斥秦王背信無禮，貪婪卑鄙

<br>一方面指超圖信賴秦王，尊重秦國，所以隆重其事，一方面責備秦王禮節倨傲


<br>藺相如威脅秦王若他想強行奪回壁玉，自己便與壁玉一起撞在柱子上同歸於盡
<br>秦王唯有命令管理版圖的官員按著地圖，假意劃出城池給趙國
<br>藺相如要求奉秦王齋戒五日，並設九賓之禮，才願意奉上璧玉

<br>以此拖延時間，乘機派人暗中從小路將壁玉送回趙國


<br>秦王許諾相如的要求，進行為期五日的齋戒，並將相如安置在廣成賓館

<br>再見秦王

<br>藺相如此時手中無璧，已無後顧之憂

<br>但身陷秦國，隨時面臨被秦王一怒之下殺死的危機


<br>相如不懼怕，他先是斥責秦國自先王穆公而來，未試過嚴守承諾，所以自己擔憂被騙，才將璧玉送回趙國
<br>相如又對秦王指出，秦國勢大，只要秦王先償付城池，趙國必定奉上壁玉
<br>藺相如指自己願意為欺瞞秦王而以死謝罪，請秦王賜下「湯鑊」 之刑
<br>秦王既不能取得璧玉，又不想殺害相如而斷絕秦趙之間的外交

<br>只能無可奈何地禮待相如，並放他歸趙



<br><br>精簡: 藺相如被封為上大夫，趙國保存着和氏璧，沒有交到秦王手中。<br>回到趙國

<br>趙王認為蘭相如賢能，拜封他為上大夫
<br>秦國始終沒有償付城池，趙國也沒有奉上壁玉，兩者互無得失

② (a)   趙惠文王時，得楚和氏璧。秦昭王聞之，使人遺趙王書，願以十五城請易璧。趙王與大將軍廉頗諸大臣謀：欲予秦，秦城恐不可得，徒見欺；欲勿予，即患秦兵之來。計未定，求人可使報秦者，未得。宦者令繆賢曰：「臣舍人藺相如可使。」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
趙惠文王在位時，得到楚國的和氏璧。秦昭王聽聞這個消息後，就派人送给趙王一封書信，表示願意用十五座城池來換取和氏璧。趙王和大將軍廉頗以及眾多大臣商議說：「想把和氏璧交予秦國，卻害怕得不到秦國的城池，徒然被欺騙;想不交予和氏璧，又害怕秦國的士兵前來攻打。計謀尚未議定，徵求可以作為使者去答覆秦國的人，卻又未有合適的人選。宦官頭目繆賢便說：「我的門客藺相如可作為使者。」

② (b)   王問：「何以知之？」對曰：「臣嘗有罪，竊計欲亡走燕，臣舍人相如止臣，曰：『君何以知燕王？』臣語曰：『臣嘗從大王與燕王會境上，燕王私握臣手，曰「願結友。」以此知之，故欲往。』相如謂臣曰：『夫趙彊而燕弱，而君幸於趙王，故燕王欲結於君。今君乃亡趙走燕，燕畏趙，其勢必不敢留君，而束君歸趙矣。君不如肉袒伏斧質請罪，則幸得脫矣。』臣從其計，大王亦幸赦臣。臣竊以為其人勇士，有智謀，宜可使。」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
趙王問道：「為何知道他適合擔任？」繆賢回答說：「我曾經犯罪，私下打算要從趙國逃亡到燕國。我的門客藺相如阻止我說：『你為何知道燕王會收留你？』我告訴他說：『我曾經跟從大王與燕在趙國的邊境上會面，燕王私下握着我的手，說：「願意與你結為朋友。」因此我知道燕王會收留我，所以想前往燕國。』相如對我說：『趙國強大而燕國弱小，那時你得到趙王的恩寵，所以燕王才想和你結交。現在你是從趙國逃亡至燕國，燕國畏懼趙國，燕王必定不敢收留你，反而一定將你綁起來交給趙國。你不如赤身伏在斧質 (一種刑具) 上，請求降罪。』我跟從他的計策，幸好大王亦赦免了我。我個人認為他是個勇士，有智慧謀略，適合派他出使。

② (c)   於是王召見，問藺相如曰：「秦王以十五城請易寡人之璧，可予不？」相如曰：「秦彊而趙弱，不可不許。」王曰：「取吾璧，不予我城，奈何？」相如曰：「秦以城求璧而趙不許，曲在趙；趙予璧而秦不予趙城，曲在秦。均之二策，寧許以負秦曲。」王曰：「誰可使者？」相如曰：「王必無人，臣願奉璧往使。城入趙而璧留秦；城不入，臣請完璧歸趙。」趙王於是遂遣相如奉璧西入秦。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
於是趙王便召見藺相如，問他說：「秦王以十五城請求換取我的和氏璧，可以交予嗎？」相如說：「秦國強大而趙國弱小，不能不答應。」趙王說：「取得我的壁玉，卻不給我城池，應該怎樣做？」相如說：「秦國用城池來求取璧玉而趙國不答應，這是趙國理虧；趙交予璧玉而秦國不交予城池，這是秦國理虧。衡量這兩個對策，寧願答應將璧玉給予秦國，令它負上理虧的責任。」趙王「說：「誰人可以擔當使者？」相如曰：「大王果真沒有人可以任用的話，我願意捧着和氏璧去出使秦國。要是城池劃入趙國的版圖，那麼我就讓璧玉留在秦國；要是城池不能劃入趙國版圖，那麼微臣請求把壁完完整整地帶回趙國。」趙王於是便派遣相如捧上璧玉向西進入秦國。

③ (a)   秦王坐章台見相如，相如奉璧奏秦王。秦王大喜，傳以示美人及左右，左右皆呼萬歲。相如視秦王無意償趙城，乃前曰：「璧有瑕，請指示王。」王授璧，相如因持璧，卻立，倚柱，怒髮上衝冠，謂秦王曰：「大王欲得璧，使人發書至趙王，趙王悉召羣臣議，皆曰：『秦貪，負其彊，以空言求璧，償城恐不可得』。議不欲予秦璧。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦王坐在秦宮章台 (秦宮名) 中召見相如。相如奉上和氏璧獻給秦王。秦王十分高興，傳給秦王的妃子、宮女和左右侍從觀賞，左右侍從全都高呼萬歲。相如看到秦王沒有意圖償付趙國城池，於是上前說：「和氏璧上有瑕疵，請讓我指示給大王你看。」秦王便授予相如璧玉，相如就拿着璧玉退後站着，倚靠着柱子，憤怒得頭髮直豎，好像衝起了帽子。向秦王說：「大王想得到和氏璧，派使使者發送書信給趙王，趙王召集全部臣子商議，他們全都說：『秦國貪心，恃着它的強大，用空口白話來求取璧玉，償付的城池恐怕不能得到。』商議不想交予秦國璧玉。

③ (b)   臣以為布衣之交尚不相欺，況大國乎！且以一璧之故逆彊秦之驩，不可。於是趙王乃齋戒五日，使臣奉璧，拜送書於庭。何者？嚴大國之威以修敬也。今臣至，大王見臣列觀，禮節甚倨；得璧，傳之美人，以戲弄臣。臣觀大王無意償趙王城邑，故臣復取璧。大王必欲急臣，臣頭今與璧俱碎於柱矣！」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
我以為平民百姓交往尚且不會互相欺騙，何況是偌大的國家呢？而且因為一塊壁的緣故而拂逆了強秦的歡心，這是不可以的。於是趙王便齋戒五日，派使我捧着壁玉，在朝廷上行禮，送出國書。為甚麼呢？因為尊重你大國的威嚴而表達敬意呀！如今我到達這裏，大王你接見我於一般宮殿中，禮節十分傲慢;得到和氏壁後，傳遞給妃子、客女，用來戲弄我。我觀察大王沒有意圖償付趙王城池，所以我重新取回璧玉。大王必定想逼迫我，我的頭顱今天就和壁玉一起撞碎在柱子上吧！」

③ (c)   相如持其璧睨柱，欲以擊柱。秦王恐其破璧，乃辭謝固請，召有司案圖，指從此以往十五都予趙。相如度1秦王特以詐佯為予趙城，實不可得，乃謂秦王曰：「和氏璧，天下所共傳寶也。趙王恐，不敢不獻。趙王送璧時，齋戒五日，今大王亦宜齋戒五日，設九賓於廷，臣乃敢上璧。」秦王度2之，終不可彊奪，遂許齋五日，舍相如廣成傳。相如度1秦王雖齋，決負約不償城，乃使其從者衣褐，懷其璧，從徑道亡，歸璧於趙。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
相如手持璧玉斜視柱子，想用來撞擊柱子。秦王恐怕他破壞璧玉，於是婉言道歉，堅決請求藺相如不要這樣做。召喚管理版圖的官吏按着地圖，指着從這裏到那裏十五個城都給予趙國。相如估計秦王只是特意以狡詐的話裝作要給趙國都城，實際其不可以得到，於是向秦王說:「和氏壁，是大家公認的寶物。趙王懼怕秦國，不敢不獻出壁玉。趙王送出璧玉時，齋戒了五日，如今大王也應當齋戒五日，在宮廷上設九賓之禮，臣才敢獻上壁玉。」秦王揣度情況，認為終歸不能以粗野的手段奪取，於是答應齋戒五日，並把相如安置在廣成賓館。相如估計秦王雖然答應齋戒，但一定違約不償行城池，於是命令他的隨從穿着粗布便衣，懷中藏着璧玉，由小路逃走，將璧玉送歸趙國。

④ (a)   秦王齋五日後，乃設九賓禮於廷，引趙使者藺相如。相如至，謂秦王曰：「秦自繆公以來二十餘君，未嘗有堅明約束者也。臣誠恐見欺於王而負趙，故令人持璧歸，間至趙矣。且秦彊而趙弱，大王遣一介之使至趙，趙立奉璧來；今以秦之彊而先割十五都予趙，趙豈敢留璧而得罪於大王乎？臣知欺大王之罪當誅，臣請就湯鑊。唯大王與羣臣孰計議之！」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦王齋戒五日後，便在宮廷上設九賓之禮，引見趙國的使者藺相如。相如來到，向秦王說：「秦國自謬公以來有二十幾個君主，未曾有堅守信約的君主。我真的恐怕被大王欺騙而辜負趙國，所以每人帶着壁玉歸去，已從偏僻的小路回到趙國了。而且秦國強大而趙國弱小，大王只需派遣一個「使者前往趙國，趙國立刻奉上壁玉過來。現在憑着秦國的強大而且先割讓十五座城池交予趙國，趙國怎麼膽敢保留璧玉而得罪大王呢？我知道欺瞞大王的罪行應該被誅殺，我請受湯錢之刑。希望大王和眾多臣子考慮商議一下！」

④ (b)   秦王與羣臣相視而嘻。左右或欲引相如去，秦王因曰：「今殺相如，終不能得璧也，而絕秦趙之驩，不如因而厚遇之，使歸趙，趙王豈以一璧之故欺秦邪！」卒廷見相如，畢禮而歸之。相如既歸，趙王以為賢大夫，使不辱於諸侯，拜相如為上大夫。秦亦不以城予趙，趙亦終不予秦璧。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦王與眾多臣子互相對望而發出又驚又怒的聲音。左右有人想拉相如出去治罪，秦王於是說：「今殺相如，終究不能得到壁玉，而且會斷絕了秦國與趙國的友好關係，不如就此優厚地招待他，讓他返回趙國，趙王怎會因為一塊璧玉的緣故而欺騙我們秦國呢？」終於在宮廷上召見相如，完成外交禮節，然後送他歸去。相如回到趙國，趙王認為他勝過一般的大夫，出拜使諸侯之國能不受欺辱，便拜封相如為上大夫。結果秦國亦沒有將城池给予趙國，趙國亦終究沒有交予秦國壁玉。

⑤ (b)   秦王使使者告趙王，欲與王為好會於西河外澠池。趙王畏秦，欲毋行。廉頗、藺相如計曰：「王不行，示趙弱且怯也。」趙王遂行，相如從。廉頗送至境，與王訣曰：「王行，度道里會遇之禮畢，還，不過三十日。三十日不還，則請立太子為王，以絕秦望。」王許之，遂與秦王會澠池。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦王派遣使者告訴趙王，他想與趙王示好，希望在西河外的濾池會面。趙王畏懼趙王，想不去。像鮪、蘭相如推斷說:「大王你不前去的話，就代表軟弱而且怯懦了。」趙王於是前去，相如隨行。廉頗護送趙王到邊境上，與趙王告別說:「大王這次出行，估計從路上行走一直到會面的禮節完畢，然後返回，不會超過三十日。如果三十日也不回來，就請大王允許我們擁立太子為王，以斷絕秦國 (扶持趙王來要脅) 的野心。」大王答允這個請求，便和秦王在渑池會面。

⑤ (c)   秦王飲酒酣，曰：「寡人竊聞趙王好音，請奏瑟。」趙王鼓瑟。秦御史前書曰：「某年月日，秦王與趙王會飲，令趙王鼓瑟。」藺相如前曰：「趙王竊聞秦王善為秦聲，請奏盆缻秦王，以相娛樂。」秦王怒，不許。於是相如前進缻，因跪請秦王。秦王不肯擊缻。相如曰：「五步之內，相如請得以頸血濺大王矣！」左右欲刃相如，相如張目叱之，左右皆靡。於是秦王不懌，為一擊缻。相如顧召趙御史書曰：「某年月日，秦王為趙王擊缻。」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
秦王飲酒到高興的時候，說：「我私下聽聞趙王愛好音律，請你彈奏瑟。」趙王便彈起了瑟。秦國的史官上前用筆寫道：「某年月日，秦王與超王會而飲酒，命令趙王彈奏瑟。」藺相如上前說：「趙王私下聽聞秦王擅長演奏秦國的音樂，請允許我獻上盆规给秦王敲擊，讓大家娛樂。」秦王聽到後大怒，不答應。於是相如上前獻上盆蛾，就跪在地上請求秦王。秦王不願意敲擊盆纸。相如說：「五步之內，我相如可以把頭血濺在大王身上了！」左右侍從想用刀刺相如，相如張開雙眼叱喝他們，侍從都害怕得退卻下來。於是秦王不高興地為趙王敲了一下盆纸。相如叫來趙國的史官用筆寫道：「某年月日，秦王為趙王敲擊盆紙。」

秦國的眾多臣子說：「請以趙國的十五座城池為秦王慶賀。」藺相如亦說：「請以秦國的首都成陽為趙王慶賀。」秦王的酒筵完畢，始終不能在氣勢上勝過趙國。趙國也大規模集結士兵來防範秦國，秦國不敢輕舉妄動。

⑥ (a)   既罷歸國，以相如功大，拜為上卿，位在廉頗之右。廉頗曰：「我為趙將，有攻城野戰之大功，而藺相如徒以口舌為勞，而位居我上，且相如素賤人，吾羞，不忍為之下。」宣言曰：「我見相如，必辱之。」相如聞，不肯與會。相如每朝時，常稱病，不欲與廉頗爭列。已而相如出，望見廉頗，相如引車避匿。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
會面完畢後回到趙國，趙王認為相如的功勞最大，拜封他作為上卿，職位在廉頗之上。廉頗說：「我作為趙國的將軍，有攻取城池在野外血戰的大功，而難相如只是憑言詞立下功勞，職位卻居於我之上，而且相如本來是出身卑賤的人，我感到羞恥，不能忍受自己的職位在他之下。」宣揚說：「我遇見相如，必定會羞辱他。」相如聞言，不肯與他會面。相如每逢上朝時，經常說自己生病，不想與廉頗爭論官位的高低。過了些時候，相如出行時遠遠望見廉頗，相如調轉車行方向躲避他。

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
於是相如的門客前來進練說：「我之所以離開親戚付奉你的原因，只是仰慕你的崇高品德。如今你與廉颇職位並列，廉頗宣揚狠惡的言論而你卻害怕躲避他，恐懼得太過分了，而且平常人尚且會感到羞恥，何況身為將相的人呢？我們沒有才能，請讓我們辭去吧。」藺相如堅決阻止他們，說：「你看廉頗將軍與秦王相比，誰比較厲害？」門客說：「不及秦王。」相如說，「憑秦王的威势，而我也敢在他的宮廷袁叱喝他，羞辱他眾多臣子，我藺相如雖然愚鈍無能，難道就只怕爆將軍嗎？

⑥ (c)   顧吾念之，彊秦之所以不敢加兵於趙者，徒以吾兩人在也。今兩虎共鬥，其勢不俱生。吾所以為此者，以先國家之急而後私讎也。」廉頗聞之，肉袒負荊，因賓客至藺相如門謝罪。曰：「鄙賤之人，不知將軍寬之至此也。」卒相與驩，為刎頸之交。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
但我想到，強秦之所以不敢發兵攻打趙國，只因有我們兩人在啊。如今兩虎相門，其形勢結果必定不能並存。我之所以這樣做，是把國家的急務為先，而把個人的私怨為後。」廉頗聽聞後，光着身子，背着荊條，藉着賓客作引導到蘭相如門前謝罪。說：「我這個見識短淺的人，不知道將軍你寬宏大量到這個地步。」終於二人和好，結誓同生死的好友。

原文<br><br>精簡: 秦王希望得到和氏璧，提出以十五城池作交換，藺相如為此出使秦國。<br>出使秦國前

<br>趙惠文王在位時，得到舉世聞名的和氏璧
<br>秦國聽聞後想據為己有，便派使者前來通報願意用十五座城池來換取寶玉
<br>趙王和群臣得知消息後，陷入既害怕秦王貞約，又擔憂秦兵來犯的困境

<br>以此鋪墊藺相如的登場，並以群臣的無能襯托相如的賢明能幹


<br>此時宦官頭目繆賢引薦藺相如，以自己曾經被相如阻止畏罪潛逃至燕國的經歷

<br>指出相如有勇有謀，能夠勝任出使秦國的使者


<br>其後趙王召見相如，對談間相如向越王分析形勢，並自薦出使，承諾若得不到秦國的城池，必定「完璧歸趙」

<br>趙王因此信任相如，派使他出使秦國



<br><br>精簡:<br>
<br>藺相如把和氏璧獻到秦王手上，但從秦王的態度看出他沒有誠意以十五城池作交換
<br>便藉口璧上有瑕疵，要求檢查一下以取回氏璧
<br>再暗中派人把璧送回趙國，並表示任憑秦王處置
<br>相如視死如歸的態度折服了秦王，於是讓他返回趙國
<br>初見秦王

<br>秦王坐在偏殿章台接見相如

<br>章台是登臨遊樂的地方，秦王不在正殿進行接見，反映他輕視相如


<br>秦王接過壁玉，顯得十分高興，將壁玉傳給妃子、宮女以及侍從觀賞

<br>反映秦王已將壁玉當作己有，態度傲慢


<br>相如看出秦王無意償付城池，便謊稱壁玉有瑕疵，要指示給秦王看

<br>以此取回壁玉，奪回主導權


<br>相如取得壁玉後，怒斥秦王背信無禮，貪婪卑鄙

<br>一方面指超圖信賴秦王，尊重秦國，所以隆重其事，一方面責備秦王禮節倨傲


<br>藺相如威脅秦王若他想強行奪回壁玉，自己便與壁玉一起撞在柱子上同歸於盡
<br>秦王唯有命令管理版圖的官員按著地圖，假意劃出城池給趙國
<br>藺相如要求奉秦王齋戒五日，並設九賓之禮，才願意奉上璧玉

<br>以此拖延時間，乘機派人暗中從小路將壁玉送回趙國


<br>秦王許諾相如的要求，進行為期五日的齋戒，並將相如安置在廣成賓館

<br>再見秦王

<br>藺相如此時手中無璧，已無後顧之憂

<br>但身陷秦國，隨時面臨被秦王一怒之下殺死的危機


<br>相如不懼怕，他先是斥責秦國自先王穆公而來，未試過嚴守承諾，所以自己擔憂被騙，才將璧玉送回趙國
<br>相如又對秦王指出，秦國勢大，只要秦王先償付城池，趙國必定奉上壁玉
<br>藺相如指自己願意為欺瞞秦王而以死謝罪，請秦王賜下「湯鑊」 之刑
<br>秦王既不能取得璧玉，又不想殺害相如而斷絕秦趙之間的外交

<br>只能無可奈何地禮待相如，並放他歸趙



<br><br>精簡: 藺相如被封為上大夫，趙國保存着和氏璧，沒有交到秦王手中。<br>回到趙國

<br>趙王認為蘭相如賢能，拜封他為上大夫
<br>秦國始終沒有償付城池，趙國也沒有奉上壁玉，兩者互無得失

完璧歸趙<br><br>精簡: 秦王邀約趙王於澠池進行友好會面。趙王初時猶疑，但仍聽藺相如勸告會面秦王。<br>會面前

<br>秦國兩次攻打趙國，攻陷趙國的石城並殺害二萬人，秦王邀約趙王在澠池會面

<br>假意修好，實則不懷好意


<br>趙王因為害怕遭受不測，想不去，但廉頗、藺相如都認為應該前去，以免顯得趙國軟弱怯懦
<br>結果趙王決定前去，藺相如伴隨趙王出行，訣別時廉頗請求趙王，答應如果他們三十日不回來，就立太子為新王

<br>以杜絕秦國想挾持趙王來要脅超圈的野心



<br><br>精簡:<br>
<br>秦王請趙王奏瑟，並命令御史記記下：「秦王令趙王奏樂。」意欲羞辱趙王。
<br>相如於是威脅秦王擊缻唱歌，然後命趙國御史記記下：「秦王為趙王擊缻。」
<br>秦國群臣然後要求趙王贈十五城池祝秦王長壽。
<br>相如也馬上要求秦王贈咸陽祝趙王長壽。
<br>會面時

<br>秦王借飲酒飲得高興時，請趙王彈奏瑟，在趙王彈完後，就命今史官記下自己命令趙王彈瑟之事

<br>希望藉此佔得趙國上風


<br>藺相如為保超越國威嚴，上前以性命相通，獻上盆缻請求秦王擊缻，如果秦王不肯，就將自己的頸血濺在秦王身上，秦王的侍從想上前刺死相如，卻被相如怒目呵斥，嚇得後退

<br>秦王為免被藺相如的血液玷污身體，有損帝王之尊，只能無奈地敲了一下盆缻


<br>藺相如馬上召來趙國史官記載秦王為趙王擊缻之事

<br>令趙國的尊嚴得到保全


<br>秦國的眾多臣子並不罷休，便提出要求趙國獻出十五座城池為秦王慶賀的無理要求
<br>藺相如還擊，提出請秦國獻出首都咸陽為趙王慶賀的要求

<br>獻出首都代表投降



<br><br>精簡: 藺相如立下大功，被拜為上卿。<br>會面結果

<br>秦國因為藺相如的智勇雙全，始终未能佔得趙國上風
<br>加上廉頗在邊境佈置重兵，秦國也不敢輕舉妄動

澠池之會<br><br>精簡: 廉頗不甘處於藺相如地位之下，誓要羞辱藺相如一番。<br>事件背景

<br>藺相如因為澠池之會上的功勞，被趙王擢升為上卿，官位在廉頗之上，令廉頗不服氣
<br>廉頗認為自己是憑汗血功勞才能有如今的官位，但藺相如卻只憑口舌之利就得到比自己更高的官位，感到非常羞恥，因此揚言自己見到藺相如，必定會出言羞辱他

<br><br>精簡:<br>
<br>藺相如為了避開廉頗，經常早朝稱病；出門坐車時也要改道避開廉頗。
<br>之後藺相如的舍人打算離去，相如阻止他們，並說自己忍讓是因為「以先國家之急而後私讎也」。
<br>詳細經過

<br>藺相如聞言處處忍讓迴避，甚至調轉車頭避開廉頗，相如的門客忍受不了，便向相如直言覺得他太過懼怕廉頗， 沒有出息所以請求離去。
<br>藺相如勸阻門客，並作出解釋：

<br>指出廉頗比不上秦王，自己面對秦王尚且敢直斥辱罵他，因此自己並非畏懼廉頗
<br>指出秦國不敢攻打趙國的原因皆因為自己與廉頗二人俱在，如果自己與廉頗「兩虎共鬥」，勢必不能並存，令秦國有機可乘，危及國家安危
<br>指出自己看重的是國家急務，而非私人恩怨



<br><br>精簡: 廉頗與藺相如結交為出生入死的好朋友。<br>事件結果

<br>這番說話傳到廉頗耳中，他既感動又慚愧，於是光着身子，背負荊條向藺相如請罪

<br>最終二人和好並結為刎頸之交



負荊請罪<br>
<br>廉頗: 超阀的優秀將領，以勇氣聞名於世，擔任上卿的職位
<br>藺相如: 趙國宦官頭目的門客，與廉能身份地位懸殊

①   大江東去，浪淘盡、千古風流人物。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
長江江水向東流去，巨浪沖洗盡年代久遠的傑出英雄人物（的事蹟）。
<br>
<br>就地寫景，描寫赤壁磯風起浪湧的壯觀景色

<br>以江水浩蕩東去，強調時間流逝的自然規律
<br>千古以來的英雄人物都像被江浪淘盡似的，在歷史舞台上消逝
<br>感慨豪傑英雄都被沖洗淨盡，與時俱逝，抒發歲月流逝、物是人非的感慨


<br>
②   故壘西邊，人道是、三國周郎赤壁。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
舊時的營壘西邊，人們說那就是，三國時期周瑜（大敗曹操）的赤壁遺跡。
<br>
<br>切入主題，交代主角

<br>指出眼前的赤壁磯可能是赤壁大戰的戰場
<br>「人道是」表現作者內心存疑，不過即使眼前的赤壁似是而非，也足以引發作者聯想當時赤壁大戰的情景，並產生對周瑜的追憶懷念


<br>
③   亂石穿空，驚濤拍岸，捲起千堆雪。江山如畫，一時多少豪傑！<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
陡峭不平的石壁直聳雲天，令人驚恐的波濤拍擊岸邊，激起的浪花好似捲起千萬堆白雪。江河山川麗如圖畫，一個時期涌現出多少英雄豪傑！
<br>
<br>描寫赤壁磯的風景

<br>陡峭的石壁插入天空，巨浪拍擊岸邊，捲起無數雪白的浪花
<br>景色營造出的氣勢：雄偉壯麗，氣勢磅礡
<br>聯想及感慨：引起對赤壁之戰中英雄豪傑的懷想


<br>//TODO import 修辭手法<br>象徵意義

<br>「浪」象徵「時間」，特點是不斷流動
<br>「赤壁」象徵「歷史」，特點是凝定的
<br>兩個矛盾的意象並列，能反映詞人內心的掙扎: 究竟自己會給時間淘去無蹤，還是能在歷史上留下名聲?
<br>這樣內心掙扎為下片作鋪墊，使其自我慰解更顯豁達

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
回想昔日的周瑜，絕代佳人小喬剛嫁給他，他雄壯的姿態彷彿英氣風發的樣子。
<br>
<br>寫人詠懷，引出風流人物 (周瑜)<br>
以美人襯托英雄，突顯周瑜年少得意的英雄形象
<br>懷想周瑜之缘故:<br>
<br>蘇軾當時遊黃州赤鼻磯，傳說當地是三國時代「赤壁之戰」戰場。
<br>周瑜就曾在赤壁統率孫劉聯軍以寡敵眾，大敗曹軍，留下英雄事跡。
<br>蘇軾寫這首詞時年近半百，被貶黃州，投閒置散，周瑜年青有為，功業有成，反襯自己年老卻功業無成，藉此抒發自己壯志未酬的感慨。
<br>修辭手法

<br>示現: 欣羨及讚譽周瑜年少英俊，愛情得意，見解卓越不凡。

<br>
⑤   羽扇綸巾，談笑間、檣櫓灰飛煙滅。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
(他手拿著) 羽毛扇子，(頭戴著) 青絲頭巾，談笑之間，曹軍的戰船就燒得灰飛煙滅。
<br>
<br>塑造周瑜形象

<br>英姿雄偉，神采煥發；手執羽扇，頭戴青絲帶頭巾，一身儒將裝束
<br>在談笑間燒毀曹操的戰船 / 殲滅曹操的軍隊，從容取勝


<br>修辭手法

<br>示現: 欣羨及讚譽周瑜以儒將身份在戰場上指揮若定，立下大功。
<br>誇張: 周瑜從容取勝

<br><br>
⑥   故國神遊，多情應笑我， 早生華髮。人間如夢，一尊還酹江月。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
我今日神遊當日的赤壁戰場，應該笑我多情善感，過早長出滿頭白髮。人人生猶如一場夢，(我姑且) 把一樽 灑酒祭奠江中的明月。
<br>
<br>
反襯自身，抒發情感

<br>以周瑜在赤壁建功立業，留名青史，反襯自己年華老去，功業未成的感慨。
<br>感歎人間如夢，豐功偉業轉瞬即逝，最後以酒灑祭風流人物，借一樽酒沉醉江月，作自我安慰。


<br>
自我開解 (曠達的人生態度)

<br>自己年華老去、功業未成而感慨，但他想到歷史上的英雄人物也會被時間沖洗淨盡。
<br>這一切到頭來也是虛夢一場，因此體悟到人生就像夢一樣虛幻，明白自己無須為不能建功立業而苦惱。
<br>既然人事最終都會給時間淘去，不如放開心懷，放下執念，享受當下江月的美景，珍惜當下，邀月共飲。

 <br><br>
<br>詞牌：聲聲慢
<br>詞題：秋情
<br>字數：97字 (長調)
<br>段數：兩段 (雙調)
<br>韻腳：覓、戚、息、急、識；積、摘、黑、滴、得
<br><br><br><br>
①   尋尋覓覓，冷冷清清，淒淒慘慘戚戚。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
苦苦地尋尋覓覓，卻只見冷冷清清，怎不讓人凄慘悲戚。
<br>
<br>描寫秋天景象

<br>尋尋覓覓: 反覆不捨地想要尋找已經失去的人、事、物
<br>冷冷清清: 尋無所獲，環境冷清，內心寂寞
<br>悽悽慘慘戚戚: 寫內心悽慘憂傷逐步加深<br>
↪️ 內心感受: 悽慘悲痛


<br>修辭手法: 層遞

<br>第一至二層: 反映了作者的內心由若有所失的空虛變得寂寞
<br>第三層: 無比的悲痛
<br>層層遞進的描寫為後文的秋景渲染了一份揮之不去愁緒
<br>令結尾提到是否可用一個「愁」字概括得了的反問更顯沉重

<br><br>
②   乍暖還寒時候，最難將息。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
深秋天氣忽然變化，天氣忽冷忽熱，最難休息。
<br>
<br>描寫秋天氣温

<br>忽暖忽冷，令人難以調養休息，心情也難以平復。
<br>抒發感情: 以氣温忽暖忽冷暗示心情難安，起伏不定，愁思滿懷。


<br>
③   三杯兩盞淡酒，怎敵他、晚來風急!<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
喝三杯兩杯淡酒，怎能抵禦早晨的寒風急襲!
<br>
<br>描寫秋天風勢

<br>晚風急勁，喝淡酒不足以取暖，也暗示喝酒未能消愁。
<br>抒發感情: 以急勁的寒風抒發晚景淒涼的感受。


<br>
④   雁過也，正傷心，卻是舊時相識。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
一行大雁從眼前飛過，更讓人傷心，因為都是舊日的相識。
<br>
<br>描寫雁過

<br>見天上雁過，覺得是舊相識，表達思念故鄉和故國之情。
<br>抒發感情: 以南飛的北雁抒發流落江南之悲。


<br>雁是「舊時相識」的原因:<br>
<br>作者原是北方人，過冬而南飛的秋雁也是來自北方。
<br>雁為候鳥，在古代象徵遊子的懷鄉愁緒和對親人的思念 /<br>
雁在古代象徵傳遞音信的使者。  
<br>作者在北宋滅亡後南渡，丈夫不久亦逝世，因此她這樣形容，也是為了表達對國破家亡的哀傷。
<br>觸景生情之解釋:<br>
<br>傷心之情是因作者看到秋雁南渡過冬的情景而觸發，是詩人直接道明而不是將情融入景中，通過暗示表達情感。
<br><br><br>
⑤   滿地黃花堆積，憔悴損，如今有誰堪摘?<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
園中菊花堆積滿地，都已經憔悴不堪，如今還有誰能夠/可以來採摘?
<br>
<br>描寫黃花

<br>菊花堆積滿地，憔悴凋零，想到無人能與她一起採摘而感到孤單，也有借花喻人之意，自傷年華老去，身世飄零。    
<br>抒發感情: 以滿地凋零的黃花 / 菊花自傷年華老去，容顏憔悴，孤苦無依。


<br>
⑥   守着窗兒，獨自怎生得黑? 梧桐更兼細雨，到黃昏、點點滴滴。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
冷清清地守著窗子，獨自一個人怎麼 / 如何熬到天黑? 梧桐葉上細雨淋漓，到黃昏時分，還是點點滴滴。
<br>
<br>抒發孤獨情感

<br>獨守窗前，憂慮時間過得太慢，有度日如年之感。
<br>梧桐葉落，又下着細雨，景象淒清，令人傷感。
<br>到了黃昏，雨水打在梧桐樹上的聲音，使人更添愁苦。
<br>描寫秋日庭中景象，梧桐葉落，景象淒清，細雨到黃昏還沒停，長夜將至，使人更添愁苦。

<br>作者當時身處的環境: 梧桐葉落 、雨聲淅瀝
<br>突顯作者孤單寂寞的感受




<br>達到的抒情效果:<br>
<br>秋天梧桐葉落的景象，正好襯托詞人孤寂的心情。
<br>細雨點滴打在梧桐樹上的聽覺描寫，則反映作者在寂靜的夜晚孤單聽雨的境況。
<br>通過結合視覺和聽覺描寫的景象，能把作者的孤獨愁苦渲染得更深。
<br>修辭手法

<br>反問: 先描寫自己守着窗邊，再以反問的手法，強調自己過着形單隻影的生活，從而令「獨自怎生得黑」的孤獨情感更加鮮明突出。

<br><br>
⑦   這次第，怎一箇愁字了得?<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
這般光境，怎麼能用一個「愁」字了結 / 完結 (指概括得了)?
<br>
<br>全首詞描寫的一連串景物，包含作者的萬般愁思，一個「愁」字不足以說得完。

<br>詞牌：青玉案
<br>詞題：元夕
<br>字數：67字 (中調)
<br>段數：兩段 (雙調)
<br>韻腳：樹、雨、路、舞；縷、去、度、處
<br><br><br><br>
①   東風夜放花千樹，更吹落、星如雨。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
春風吹起的晚上，花燈有如千樹之花一樣被東風吹得綻放，吹落的煙花有如雨點般落下。
<br>奇妙情景: 春風吹來，花燈掛滿街巷、煙花點點散落<br>
<br>元宵節的真實場景本來已經美麗， 再將「春風」、「花燈」及「煙花」相互扣連，寫春風吹動如千樹之花的花燈;
<br>吹落煙花，化作雨點落下， 將眼前景色的繁華美麗比喻得奇妙吸引， 彷彿將整個元宵所見之景呈現眼前。
<br>
②   寶馬雕車香滿路。鳳簫聲動，玉壺光轉，一夜魚龍舞。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
名貴的駿馬、裝飾華麗的馬車來回走動，車中人的衣馨之香溢滿整條街道。悠揚的鳳簫聲四處回蕩，玉壺般的明月在天上輪轉，魚龍形狀的彩燈徹夜飛舞。
<br>熱鬧盛況:<br>
<br>名貴的駿馬與雕刻上花紋、彩繪的馬車在路上穿梭，車上傳來乘客的陣陣衣鬢之香，溢滿整條道路。
<br>四處響起簫聲，明月之光在轉動，魚龍狀的彩燈在飛舞。<br>
借助街上所見所聞，呈現元宵佳節的繁盛與熱鬧。
<br><br><br>
③   蛾兒雪柳黃金縷，笑語盈盈暗香去。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
路上的女子穿戴着各種頭飾，笑談着走過，露出含情 (脈脈) 的樣子，身上的香氣隨着她們的腳步遠去。
<br>群芳爭豔:<br>
<br>婦女談笑着走過，儀態萬千，含情脈脈，衣鬢的淡香隨着她們的腳步遠去。
<br>通過路上女子形形色色的華美裝扮、行為，突顯元宵節路上的熱鬧盛況，也鋪墊下文那人的出現。
<br>
④   眾裏尋他千百度；驀然迴首，那人卻在、燈火闌珊處。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
在人群中尋找那人千百次 (回)，突然一回頭，不經意間卻在燈火疏落 (暗淡、零落) 之處發現了她。
<br>
<br>尋覓未果: 在人群中不斷尋覓那人，卻未見其蹤影，帶出全文的重點: 尋覓「那人」。
<br>突然回顧: 偶然回頭一看，製造突如其來的驚喜。
<br>聚焦重點: 主角身處燈火稀疏、幽暗的角落，將前文所有繁華的美景盛況之描述抹去，獨留主角一人成為全文焦點。
<br>「那人」含意:<br>
<br>那人獨自站在冷清幽暗的角落，不投入元宵佳節的盛況之中，表達了自甘寂寞，不與世俗同流合污的高尚情操。
<br>形單隻影的那人代表作者，在沉迷享樂、安逸的南宋之中苦苦堅持的救國反攻的理念，以此傳達悲涼孤獨的情緒。

<br>體裁: 五言律詩
<br>句式: 全詩八句，每句五字
<br>用韻: 偶句押韻：秋、流、舟、留 (尤韻)
<br>對仗: 頷聯、頸聯對偶
<br>平仄: 上句和下句的字平仄相對
<br><br><br>
①   空山新雨後，天氣晚來秋。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
空曠的山野剛剛下了一場雨，夜晚降臨使人感到已是初秋。
<br>
<br>
交代背景，營造氣氛 (季節、時間、地點、天氣、環境)<br>
一片山麓之中，剛下過雨，傍晚秋涼的天氣，幽靜怡人、空靈飄逸、清新靜謐。

<br>
用字精妙，意境深遠 (「空」意境)

<br>表達空靈的感覺，人跡罕至，遠離煩囂，人與自然融為一體，渾然天成。

<br>「禪」意，佛學境界:「一切皆空」的豁達心境，不求名利，平淡自然。




<br><br>
②   明月松間照，清泉石上流。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
皎潔明月從松樹葉縫間灑下，清澈泉水在山石上淙淙淌流。
<br>
<br>
概括畫面，取材精闢<br>
取月亮、松林、流水及白石等山間秋暮最有特徵的景物構圖寫景

<br>
由遠至近，由上至下

<br>先寫遠在天邊的高山、明月
<br>然後再寫高聳的松林，到林間低處的泉水
<br>順序鋪排，起落有致，更易在讀者腦中構建一幅立體的畫面，加強臨場感


<br>
意象清雅，脱俗自然<br>
皎潔的明月在松林間映照著，清澈的泉水在石頭上流淌著

<br>準確傳達作者心中清新暢快的感受
<br>鮮明完整的畫面上突出清爽淨的基調


<br><br>
③   竹喧歸浣女，蓮動下漁舟。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
竹林喧鬧知是洗衣姑娘歸家，蓮葉輕搖是順流而下的輕舟。
<br>
<br>
曲折有致，層次豐富<br>
未見其物，先聞其聲，按照心理感覺順序構成句子

<br>先聞竹林中喧鬧聲，再見洗衣女
<br>先看見蓮花搖動，再見漁舟順流而下


<br>
抒發嚮往，暗示決心

<br>抒發對大自然、隱居山林的嚮往
<br>暗示對世俗官場的厭惡，歸隱的決心


<br>
取材豐富，含意深遠

<br>「竹」、「蓮」代表君子，志行高潔
<br>竹子中空外直，象徵君子正直、虛心受教
<br>蓮花出污泥而不染，象徵君子不受世俗影響


<br>
承上深化，結構嚴謹

<br>「竹喧歸浣女」與上聯的「晚來秋」、「清泉」相扣
<br>「蓮動下漁舟」與「流」相扣


<br>
倒裝句式，突出動態

<br>「歸」、「下」的動作放在名詞之前，增添動感


<br>手法

<br>
以聲襯靜: 「竹喧歸浣女」<br>
幽靜的山間傳來一羣洗衣服回來的女子的喧鬧聲，劃破山間的寧靜，以喧鬧聲反襯山間的幽靜。

<br>
以動襯靜: 「清泉石上流」、「蓮動下漁舟」<br>
在寧靜的晚上，詩人描寫了石上流動的清泉，以及因漁舟划過而搖動的蓮葉，景物的動態正好反襯出山間的環境和氣氛幽靜。


↪️ 突出山居安然閒適的生活
<br><br>
④   隨意春芳歇，王孫自可留。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
春日的花草不妨任憑它凋謝，秋天的山中王孫自可以久留。
<br>
<br>反用典故，表明心跡

<br>反用楚辭《招隱士》中「王孫遊兮不歸，春草生兮萋萋」，「王孫兮歸來，山中兮不可以久留」
<br>意思是山中寂寞可怕，不能久留，要招引那裡的隱士歸來，為國效力，不應留在山中
<br>表明秋色美景讓人留戀，可以留在山中，流露對隱居生活的嚮往，不慕名利的脫俗志向，也暗示對官場醜惡的厭惡

<br>用韻: 偶句押韻，並有轉韻：親、 人、身、春 (真韻) ; 亂、散、漢 (翰韻)
<br>對仗: 這體裁本不講究對仗，但本詩五、六句各自成對
<br>Tip
本文運用借景抒情，層層遞進實景抒情。
<br><br>
①   花間一壺酒，獨酌無相親。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
在花叢中擺上一壺美酒，我獨自飲酒而沒有互相親近的人。
<br>
<br>以樂襯哀，塑造孤獨處境

<br>適逢良辰美景，李白本應該感到高興
<br>但李白仕途失意，懷才不遇，心情鬱悶
<br>只好寄情於狂歌痛飲，宣洩苦悶，卻無人伴飲，只能獨自喝酒
<br>點出獨酌的處境，塑造寂寥無人的環境和氛圍


<br>手法

<br>襯托: 以景襯情 - 作者在花間月下飲酒，良辰美景，美酒當前，理應是盡情歡暢的好日子，但他卻「獨酌無相親」。眼前的景物雖美，卻無朋友與他分享，反襯出作者孤寂和苦悶。

<br><br>
②   舉杯邀明月，對影成三人。<br>
月既不解飲，影徒隨我身。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
我舉起酒杯邀請明月，對著自己的影子，湊成了三人。<br>
明月既不能理解開懷暢飲之樂，影子也只是默默地跟隨我左右。
<br>
<br>忽發其想，自娛自樂

<br>進入作者心境，詩人忽發其想，舉杯邀請月、影共飲，自娛自樂
<br>冷清的場面頓時熱鬧起來，孤獨之感暫時一掃而空，情緒開始上揚


<br>Note
此句語意出自陶潛《雜詩》中的「欲言無予和，揮杯勸孤影。」三人，指李白、月和李白的影子。
<br>
<br>重歸現實，復歸孤獨

<br>詩人發現明月和影子終究是死物，不了解人情冷暖
<br>雖然有月亮和影子相伴，但實際月亮不會飲酒，影子只會隨身而動
<br>因此又回到孤獨寂寞的狀況，強調孤獨寂寞依然，情緒又再度壓抑


<br><br>
③   暫伴月將影，行樂須及春。<br>
我歌月徘徊，我舞影零亂。<br>
醒時同交歡，醉後各分散。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
我姑且以月和影作伴，趁着美景良辰，及時行樂。<br>
我高歌，月亮伴隨我徘徊傾聽；我舞劍，影子也跟著我起舞。<br>
清醒時與月、身影一同歡樂，醉後便各自分散，不見蹤影。
<br>
<br>
安慰自身，及時行樂

<br>即便現實悲涼寂寞，為了不負良辰美景，也要及時行樂
<br>安慰自己，姑且與月影相伴
<br>再次自我開解，情緒復見上揚


<br>
飲酒作樂，熱鬧歡興

<br>渲染月影共歌共舞之歡愉

<br>李白高歌時，月亮隨著歌聲徘徊起舞 (喝醉了的幻覺)
<br>李白舞劍時，身影也隨之變得散亂 (喝醉了的步伐不穩)


<br>場面歡樂熱鬧，作者沉醉其中，心情豁然開朗


<br>
先盡興，後孤獨

<br>回歸孤獨悲情之境，清醒時仍與月影交歡，醉後又復歸寂寥冷情
<br>一切將復歸於無，實改變不了現實的孤寂，情緒又陷入低谷


<br>手法

<br>對偶: 「醒」對「醉」，「歡」對「散」。

<br><br>
④   永結無情遊，相期邈雲漢。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
日後永遠與月光和身影結伴作無情之遊，相約於遙遠的銀河之上。
<br>
<br>脫俗高潔，積極豁達<br>
筆鋒再轉，展現積極豁達

<br>雖然醉後與月影分離，卻可以相約在銀河上共續無情之遊
<br>忘卻一切是非得失，精神逍遙，超脫了俗世煩憂，一切均已釋然
<br>足見李白不為現實所阻的積極精神，脱俗高潔


<br>「無情」與「月既不解飲， 影徒隨我身 」的呼應

<br>蓋月不懂飲酒，影也不懂飲酒而只能隨身而動，這就是不諳人事，就是無情。
<br>然而我卻有情，故在我看來，月能因我之歌而徘徊，影能因我之舞而零亂，這是他者的無情，卻因我而變得有情，是以才邀月和影再次共遊。
<br>此無情實是有情，正是「多情卻似總無情」。

<br>HKDSE 2023 試卷一 Q8
有論者認為《月下獨酌》一詩，作者的情感起伏不定，雖似是排解了憂思，實未能排解。 你同意嗎？試綜合說明。
分析:

<br>你同意嗎: 需要明確立場 (同意 / 不同意)
<br>綜合: 內容必囊括全詩
<br>憂思: 應直接點出作者的憂思
<br>情感起伏: 説明方向，作為解釋内容
<br>排解: 扣連「永結無情遊，相期邈雲漢」

答案:

<br>李白的憂思:

<br>花間一壺酒，獨酌無相親: 李白仕途失意，懷才不遇，心情鬱悶，只好寄情於狂歌痛飲，宣洩苦悶。良辰美景卻無人作伴，只能獨自喝酒，更見寂寞。


<br>李白滿懷憂思，借酒銷愁，情緒時抑時揚，起伏不定:

<br>月既不解飲，影徒隨我身: 作者慨嘆月和影終究是死物，不能真正了解自己；復感現實的孤獨，情緒又再度壓抑。
<br>暫伴月將影，行樂須及春: 為了不負良辰美景，作者姑且與月和影一起，及時行樂；他再次自我開解，情緒復見上揚。
<br>我歌月徘徊，我舞影零亂: 寫月和影隨作者歌舞而動，場面歡樂熱鬧；作者沉醉其中，心情豁然開朗。
<br>醒時同交歡，醉後各分散: 醒時雖感歡欣，但醉後卻免不了離散，一切將復歸於無；實改變不了現實的孤寂，情緒又陷入低谷。
<br>「永結無情遊，相期邀雲漢」一句可有不同的詮釋，考生須加以分析從而說明作者是否可以排解憂思。

<br>可排解憂思: 「無情」即「忘情」，作者與月和影相約銀河之上，忘卻一切是非得失，精神逍遙，超脫了俗世煩憂，一切均已釋然。
<br>未能排解憂思: 與月和影相約於遙遠的銀河之上，永遠結伴作無情之遊，期望脫離塵世；正正因為人間寂寞，他在俗世無法擺脫此種煩思，忘情共遊只不過是無可奈何，逃避現實的託詞而已。




<br>無論是否同意，必須就以下兩點分析

<br>邀月和影一起銷愁，是否可以銷愁；
<br>末句「永結無情遊，相期邈雲漢」，是超脫還是無可奈何。


<br>如未能就「永結無情遊，相期邈雲漢」一句說明，最高只給2分。

①   花近高樓傷客心，萬方多難此登臨。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
繁華靠近高樓，遠離家鄉、作客蜀地的我觸目傷心，到處災難頻繁，我卻登上高樓觀覽。
<br>
<br>
交代主題，心情局勢<br>
登臨此樓，眼前縱然繁花盛開，但天下多難，詩人因客居在外而無心賞花，腦海中滿是憂愁，感到傷心

<br>
拓寬詩勢，拉近眼前<br>
在天下多難之際登臨此樓，拓寬詩勢，將多災多難的時局拉到眼前，為下文開啟更加壯闊的境界作鋪墊

<br>手法

<br>觸景生情: 描寫春色遍地，繁花似錦的景象。作者面對美好的春景卻未感歡愉，反而想到客居在外，國家又正面臨危難，心生傷感
<br>反襯: 登上高樓，眼前縱然繁花盛開，但天下多難，詩人因客居在外而無心賞花，國家受吐蕃侵擾，內有宦官敗懷朝政，腦海中滿是憂愁，感到傷心，美麗的景色正好反襯他傷心的情懷，是以樂景寫哀情，突顯作者的傷心感受，使讀者留下深刻的印象

<br><br>
②   錦江春色來天地，玉壘浮雲變古今。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
錦江兩岸的春天蓬勃景色鋪天蓋地般湧現，玉壘山上的浮雲從古到今都千變萬化。
<br>總括:<br>
<br>囊括時空，筆力雄壯
<br>前後呼應，環環相扣
<br>寓意深刻，含意深遠
<br>闡述:<br>
<br>錦江的春色鋪天蓋地而來

<br>照應「花近高樓」，同屬亙古不變的江山景色
<br>擴闊詩中的「空間」，令全詩氣象雄渾


<br>王壘山的浮雲自古至今變化多端

<br>照應「萬方多難」，同屬變化不斷的事物
<br>藉浮雲變幻聯想到古往今來世事變遷，朝代興衰交替，變幻莫測，慨歎時局動盪，抒發對時局和國家的憂愁
<br>拓展詩中的「時間」，悠長宏大


<br>手法

<br>象徵: 「浮雲」象徵世事變遷不定、政權興亡更替無常。
<br>雙關: 「變」指玉壘山的浮雲變幻莫測，也指古今世事變幻莫測，一語雙關。
<br>觸景生情: 描寫春色遍地，繁花似錦的景象。作者面對美好的春景卻未感歡愉，反而想到客居在外，國家又正面臨危難，心生傷感。
<br>對偶: 「錦江」對「玉壘」，「春色」對「浮雲」，「來」對「變」，「天地」對「古今」，上句言及空間之廣，下句言及時間跨度之闊。

<br><br>
③   北極朝廷終不改，西山寇盜莫相侵。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
如北極星般穩固的唐朝政權終究不會更換，西山的流寇強盜（吐蕃）不要來侵擾。
<br>
<br>
局勢堪憂，仍表期許<br>
雖然當時動盪不已，但詩人仍然堅信唐朝政權有如北極星一樣亙古不變，穩如泰山，表達對國家的忠誠和信心

<br>
外族入侵，嚴辭苛斥<br>
面對外族的入侵，嚴辭警告，對國家被入侵感到憤慨不平，流露忠君愛國情懷

<br>手法

<br>借喻: 「北極」借喻唐朝政權如北極星位置一樣恆久不變，始終穩固。
<br>借代: 「西山」借代挑起戰亂的邊族吐蕃，「寇盜」借代那種侵略別國的人。
<br>對偶: 「北極」對「西山」，「朝廷」對「寇盜」，「終不改」對「莫相侵」。

<br><br>
④   可憐後主還祠廟，日暮聊為梁甫吟。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
(值得) 可憐蜀漢昏君後主劉禪仍於祠廟被人供奉，黃昏時我姑且吟誦《梁甫吟》。
<br>總括:<br>
<br>借古諷今，表明抱負
<br>懷才不遇，悲歎憂慮
<br>吟誦詩歌，表達仰慕
<br>闡述:<br>
<br>由後主祠聯想到因寵信宦官而致亡國的蜀漢後主，感歎蜀國減亡是因為諸葛亮已死
<br>蜀漢有後主此等昏君，但尚有孔明這樣的賢臣，但唐室空有昏君，且奸臣當道，而自己空有救國之心，卻不為世所用，詞人因而對國家前途感到萬分擔憂
<br>只能像諸葛亮隱居時一樣，時常吟誦《梁甫吟》，寄望朝廷能起用民間的賢能之士
<br>藉此流露追憶仰慕之情，亦為自己不能有如孔明，在亂世中受到賞識，感到抑鬱神傷
<br>手法

<br>用典:

<br>運用後主劉禪斷送國家，但死後仍有祠廟供奉的典故，表達了自己對代宗重用宦官而造成國事維艱、吐蕃入侵的局面的憂心。
<br>運用諸葛亮在隆中隱居時「好為《梁甫吟》」的典故，表達了對諸葛亮的仰慕和自己仕途不濟，報國無門的感傷。


<br>象徵: 「日暮」象徵年華老去，自傷沒有機會像諸葛亮為國效力。
<br>借古諷今: 以昏庸的後主死後還有祠廟供奉，暗諷當時在位的代宗同樣昏庸，使國家陷於內憂外患，擔心代宗重蹈覆轍。

①   子曰:「不仁者，不可以久處約，不可以長處樂。仁者安仁，知者利仁。」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
孔子說:「沒有仁德的人，不可以長久身處窮困的狀況，不可以長久身處安樂的環境。仁者因為實踐仁德而安心，知者認識到仁德對他有長遠而巨大的利益，於是便實行仁德。」
<br>
<br>
強調仁的重要性

<br>沒有仁德的人身處貧困的環境會用極端方法脫離貧窮。<br>
(e.g. 搶劫、偷竊)
<br>身處安樂的環境會不思進取。
<br>有仁德的人則兩者亦能處之泰然。


<br>
仁者與智者行仁的態度

<br>有仁德的人: 實踐仁德之事 → 感到安心
<br>有智慧的人: 利用仁德得到好處 → 願意實踐仁德

<br>仁者體道較深；若智者能堅持利仁，終可達安仁之境

②   子曰:「富與貴，是人之所欲也；不以其道得之，不處也。貧與賤，是人之所惡也；不以其道得之，不去也。君子去仁，惡乎成名？君子無終食之間違仁，造次必於是，顛沛必於是。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
孔子說:「富貴和顯貴，是人們都希望得到的；不用正當的方法得到，不會接受。貧困與低賤，是人們都厭惡的；不用正當的方法脫離，不會離棄。君子拋棄了仁德，怎樣能夠成就聲名? 君子沒有一頓飯的時間會違背仁德，倉卒急遽的情況下也是這樣，在顛沛流離的情況下也是如此。 」
<br>
<br>君子對仁的應有態度 (正反立論)

<br>富貴生活 → 正當方法得到
<br>貧賤生活 → 正當方法脫離
<br>君子即使處於倉卒急劇、顛沛流離的狀況，也應該時刻實踐仁德，片刻不離棄仁德。


<br>字詞

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
顏淵向孔子請教仁德。孔子說:「克制自己的生理本能慾望，按照禮法行事就是仁德了。一旦做到克己復禮，天下的人都會稱讚你的仁德。實踐仁德要憑自己，還要依賴別人嗎？」顏淵說:「請告訴我實踐仁德的綱目。」孔子說:「不合禮節的不要看，不合禮節的不要聽，不合禮節的不要說，不合禮節的不要做。」顏淵說:「我雖然不聰敏，但請讓我實踐你的說話。」
<br>
<br>求仁的方法:「克己復禮」

④   子曰:「志士仁人，無求生以害仁，有殺身以成仁。」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
孔子說:「有志向、仁德的人，都不會為了保存性命而損害仁德，只會犧牲自己成全仁德。」
<br>
<br>仁的最高層次<br>
將仁視作比生命更重要
<br>字詞

孟懿子向孔子請教甚麼是孝。孔子說:「不要違背禮節。」<br>

樊遲替孔子驅車，孔子告訴他說:「孟孫向我請教甚麼是孝，我對他說，不要違背禮節。」樊遲說:「這是麼意思？」孔子說:「父母在生時，依禮節侍奉他們；父母逝世時，依禮節安葬他們，依禮節祭拜他們。」
<br>
<br>孝的定義:「无違」<br>
無違於禮，不要違反禮法，對待父母的生與死，都要依照禮法行事。

━━━━━━━━━━<br>
子游向孔子請教甚麼是孝。孔子說:「現在所謂孝順的人，就是能夠供養爹娘便行了。至於狗和馬，都能夠得到飼養。如果沒有心存尊敬地孝順父母，那麼兩者有甚麼分別？」

惠子謂莊子曰：「魏王貽我大瓠之種，我樹之成而實五石。以盛水漿，其堅不能自舉也。剖之以為瓢，則瓠落無所容。非不呺然大也，吾為其無用而掊之。」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
惠子對莊子說：「魏王送給我一個大葫蘆的種子，我種植了它，結出了五石重的果實。用它來盛水或稀飯，它的質地不夠硬，無法承受自身的重量。把它割開來做器皿，卻發現它大而平淺，容不下東西。並非它不巨大，只是因為它沒有用處，所以我把它打碎了。」
<br>
<br>
葫蘆特點<br>
- 用來盛水卻不能自我支撐<br>
- 剖開來做瓢，又龐大得無處安放<br>
↪️ 最後惠子覺得葫蘆「大而無用」，所以打碎它。

<br>
惠子目的

<br>惠子藉大葫蘆體積龐大，卻缺乏實際用處
<br>諷刺莊子所提倡的思想，指出莊子的學說過於遠大而不切實際


<br>字詞

<br>貽: 送贈
<br>瓠: 葫蘆
<br>樹: 種植
<br>堅: 堅固程度
<br>剖: 破開
<br>瓢: 勺子
<br>容: 容納
<br>呺然: 虛空而巨大的樣子
<br>掊: 擊破

<br><br>
莊子曰：「夫子固拙於用大矣！宋人有善為不龜手之藥者，世世以洴澼絖為事。客聞之，請買其方百金。聚族而謀曰：『我世世為洴澼絖，不過數金；今一朝而鬻技百金，請與之。』客得之，以說吳王。越有難，吳王使之將，冬與越人水戰，大敗越人，裂地而封之。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
莊子說：「夫子實拙劣於運用大物啊！宋國有一種可以令手的皮膚不會龜裂的藥方，世世代代都以漂洗棉絮為業。有人聽說後，請求買下藥方，出價百金。聚集族人商議後說："我們世世代代都從事漂洗棉絮的工作，只能賺取幾個金子；而現在有人願意花百金買我們的技術，我們就賣給他吧。" 這人得到藥方後，遊說吳王。越國入侵，吳王派他帶兵去，冬天與越國作水戰，大敗越國，割出一塊土地而封賞他。
<br>
<br>
不龜手之藥特點<br>
同一種藥，得到的結果卻截然不同:

<br>有人用它得到封地 (價值連城)
<br>有人只用來漂洗棉絮，得到數金 (價值微薄)


<br>
莊子目的<br>
- 莊子舉出宋人賣治療皮膚龜裂藥的故事，反駁惠子對大葫蘆的看法。<br>
- 指出宋人和惠子一樣「拙於用大」，不懂妥善運用事物。<br>
↪️ 同一事物，只要思維、用法不同，效果有天淵之別，突顯「善於用大」的重要

<br>字詞

<br>固: 實在
<br>拙於: 不善於
<br>洴澼: 漂洗
<br>絖: 棉絮
<br>事: 職業
<br>鬻: 賣
<br>說: 游說
<br>裂地: 割地
<br>封: 封賞

<br><br>
能不龜手一也；或以封，或不免於洴澼絖，則所用之異也。今子有五石之瓠，何不慮以為大樽而浮乎江湖，而憂其瓠落無所容，則夫子猶有蓬之心也夫！」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
同樣一條能夠令手不龜裂的藥方，有人得到土地封賞，有人卻只用來漂洗棉絮，這就是用法的不同。如今夫子有五石重的葫蘆，為何不考慮繫着當作腰舟而浮游於江湖之上？又何必擔心瓢太大而無法容納東西呢？夫子的心如蓬草，閉塞不通。
<br>
<br>
總結論點

<br>建議惠子將大葫蘆當作大腰舟來浮游於江湖之上，就不用憂心它 「大而無用」
<br>反駁惠子「拙於用大」，不能通達事理，思想閉塞不通


<br>
展現自己思想

<br>不要執着於事物的表面，令心靈受到世俗觀念蒙蔽，不得清明
<br>應該突破思維的束縛，不拘泥於事物的用處大小
<br>達至「逍遙無待」的境界，即超脫，不去執着於外在事物的負累，超越事物大小的差別


<br>字詞

<br>能: 可以
<br>一: 同一條藥方
<br>或: 有人
<br>用: 使用方法
<br>異: 不同
<br>以為: 當作
<br>樽: 腰舟
<br>猶: 還是
<br>蓬: 閉塞不通

惠子謂莊子曰：「吾有大樹，人謂之樗；其大本擁腫而不中繩墨，其小枝卷曲而不中規矩。立之塗，匠者不顧。今子之言，大而無用，衆所同去也。」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
惠子對莊子說：「我有一棵大樹，人們叫它樗樹；它的大樹幹盤結擁腫而不符合繩墨。它的小枝彎彎曲曲而不符合規矩。 放在路上，木匠都不理它。現在你所說的這些言論，大而無用，眾人都離棄。」
<br>
<br>
樗樹特點

<br>樹幹盤踞，小枝彎曲，不合繩墨、不合規距
<br>長在大路上，木匠也不屑一顧


<br>
惠子目的

<br>惠子藉此譏諷莊子的言論就像樗樹一樣，大而無用，無人理會，被世人所離棄。


<br>字詞

<br>大本: 大樹幹
<br>擁腫: 盤結擁腫
<br>中: 符合
<br>規矩: 圓矩方矩
<br>立之塗: 生長在路上
<br>顧: 回頭看
<br>去: 離棄 / 抛棄

<br><br>
莊子曰：「子獨不見狸狌乎？卑身而伏，以候敖者；東西跳梁，不辟高下，中於機辟，死於罔罟。今夫斄牛，其大若垂天之雲；此能為大矣，而不能執鼠。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
莊子說：「你難道沒看見狸子和黃鼠狼嗎？卑伏着身子，等待出遊的小動物。東西跳躍，不顧高低，踏中捕捉鳥獸的工具，死於其中。如今旄牛，象天上的雲那麼大。它的能力是很大，但它卻捕捉不到老鼠。
<br>狸子、黃鼠狼:<br>
<br>
狸狌特點

<br>卑伏身子，匍匐在地等待捕捉獵物；
<br>東西跳躍，不避高低，最終誤中機關，死於網羅之中。


<br>
莊子目的

<br>莊子藉牠們機巧卻沒有好下場，說明不能單憑表面來判斷事物的用處；
<br>機巧靈敏在世人看來是好的特點，卻換來了慘死的壞結果；
<br>可見只憑表面來衡量，並不能真正了解事物的用處、價值。


<br>斄牛:<br>
<br>
斄牛特點

<br>屋牛體形龐大，雖不能捉老鼠，但功能卻很大
<br>體矮身健，毛長，耐粗飼
<br>尾毛蓬生，可以用來製成族旄 (旗幟)


<br>
莊子目的

<br>莊子藉釐牛行動遲鈍，不能捉老鼠，卻有其他大用，反駁惠子「大而無用」的看法。
<br>靈敏、捉老鼠只是狹隘的判斷準則，不能捉老鼠就將其視為無用，惠子一樣，只以狹隘角度來衡量事物的用處。

<br>釐牛如果不以靈敏、捉老鼠來衡量用處的話，便有着很大的用處。


<br>應該破除世俗「有用無用」、「大小」的狹隘觀念，才能察見事物真正的用處。


<br>字詞

<br>獨: 豈 / 難道
<br>敖者: 等待出遊的小動物
<br>跳梁: 跳躍
<br>辟: 躱避
<br>中: 踏中
<br>機辟: 機關
<br>罔罟: 獵網
<br>執: 捕捉

<br><br>
今子有大樹，患其無用，何不樹之於無何有之鄉，廣莫之野，彷徨乎無為其側，逍遙乎寢臥其下；不夭斤斧，物無害者。無所可用，安所困苦哉？」<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
現在夫子有一個大樹，擔心它沒有用途，為何不把它種在空闊無垠的原野上？ 隨意地在樹旁徜徉，自在地在樹下躺卧。 不遭受斧頭砍伐，沒有東西來侵害它。雖然它沒有用處，但哪裡還有什麼困難和苦惱呢？」 
<br>
<br>總結論點

<br>莊子建議惠子將樗樹種在渺無人煙、廣闊的曠野上，然後逍遙地排回在樹旁無所事事，躺臥在樹下歇息 (縱任不受拘束，優游自在，樗樹不受到摧折或傷害)，就不用理會它的用處
<br>反駁惠子被世俗執念所限制，只懂得以「有用」來理解用處，不知道「有用」、「無用」只是相對概念
<br>樗樹因為無用而不會遭到砍伐，雖似無用，實則能夠保全自身，逍遙自在，頤養天年，正是「無用之用」


<br>字詞

<br>廣莫之野: 遼闊廣大的曠野
<br>寢臥: 躺卧
<br>夭: 屈 / 摧折
<br>用: 利用
<br>安: 怎麼 / 怎會

 <br><br>
(a)   孟子曰:「魚，我所欲也，熊掌，亦我所欲也；二者不可得兼，舍魚而取熊掌者也。生亦我所欲也，義亦我所欲也；二者不可得兼，舍生而取義者也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
孟子說:「魚，是我想要的，熊掌，也是我想要的；兩者不能同時得到，便捨棄魚而選取熊掌。生命是我想要的，禮義也是我想要的；兩者不能同時得到，便捨棄生命而選取禮義。
<br>
<br>
比喻切入

<br>「魚」比喻生命 /「熊掌」比喻禮義
<br>比喻論證: 把艱深的哲理變得較為顯淺易明，令道理更為具體，令讀者易於明白抽象的概念。
<br>對比論證: 魚和熊掌都是美味的食物，但兩者不能同時得到時，會選擇熊掌。孟子透過兩者的對比，再指出生命 (魚) 和義 (熊掌) 兩者不能同時擁有時，會捨棄生命，選取義，以此立拾生取義之論。


<br>
人之本心

<br>人天生有「羞惡之心」，是人的本來就擁有的善性。
<br>特點: 將「禮義」看得比「生命」重要，在面對生命與禮義的抉擇時，認為禮義的價值更高，因此會願意捨生取義。
<br>目的:

<br>確立全文基調，明確帶出「人性本善」
<br>引出下文，帶出人不論面對什麼情況，都要懂得堅守本心




<br>字詞

<br>欲: 喜愛 / 想要
<br>得兼: 同时得到
<br>舍: 捨棄

<br><br><br>
(b)   生亦我所欲，所欲有甚於生者，故不為苟得也；死亦我所惡，所惡有甚於死者，故患有所不辟也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
生命是我想要的，但有比生命更想要的事物，所以不會苟且偷生；死亡是我厭惡的，但有比死亡更嚴惡的事物，所以有的禍患不會逃避。
<br>
<br>正面論證

<br>「義」大於生命: 生命是自己想要的，但有比生命更想要的事物 (義)，所以不願意苟且偷生。
<br>「義」大於死亡: 死亡是自己厭惡的，但有比死亡更厭惡的事物 (不義)，所以不願意不擇手段逃避禍患。


<br>字詞

<br>生: 生命
<br>甚於: 超過於
<br>故: 所以
<br>為: 做 / 實行
<br>苟得: 苟且偷生
<br>死: 死亡
<br>惡: 厭惡
<br>患: 禍患 / 災难
<br>辟: 逃避 / 避開

<br><br>
(c)   如使人之所欲莫甚於生，則凡可以得生者，何不用也？使人之所惡莫甚於死者，則凡可以辟患者，何不為也？<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
假如人沒有比生命更想要的事物，那麼但凡可以求取生命的方法，為什麼不會接受呢?假如人沒有比死亡更厭惡的事物，那麼但凡可以逃避禍患的方法，為什麼不會做呢?
<br>
<br>反面論證

<br>求生手段: 生命最想要 → 求生而無所不為
<br>避患手段: 死亡最厭惡 → 逃避死亡而無所不為
<br>反問句效果: 能使文章氣勢更強盛，內容更有說服力


<br>字詞

<br>如使、使: 假如
<br>莫: 沒有
<br>則: 那麼
<br>凡: 但凡 / 凡是
<br>得生者: 求生的方法
<br>何: 為何
<br>用: 採用
<br>患: 禍患 / 災難
<br>為: 實行

<br><br>
(d)   由是則生而有不用也，由是則可以辟患而有不為也，是故所欲有甚於生者，所惡有甚於死者。非獨賢者有是心也，人皆有之，賢者能勿喪耳。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
根據這些事例，可以活命的方法竟然有人不接受，可以避開禍患的方法竟然有人不做，因為有比生命更想要的事物，有比死亡更厭惡的事物。不只有賢者有這樣的心態，人人都有，只是賢者能夠不喪失罷了。
<br>
<br>結論: 「義」比「生」可貴重要

<br>如果兩者不能兼得，應該捨生取義，不會為了求生避禍而捨棄義。


<br>承上啟下

<br>承接上文:「捨生取義」是人之本心，不是只有賢者才有本心，人人都有。
<br>開啟下文:「利欲薰心​​」的人們會因為利益而失去本心，唯有賢者能不受影響。

<br>字詞

<br>由是: 按照這样的方法
<br>則: 就能
<br>生: 求取生命
<br>而: 卻 / 但
<br>有: 有人
<br>是故: 因為
<br>非: 並非
<br>獨: 只有
<br>賢者: 賢明的人
<br>有是心: 有這樣的心態
<br>皆: 都
<br>能: 能夠
<br>勿喪: 不喪失
<br>耳: 罷了

<br><br>分析:<br>
<br>先從正面指出人視禮義比生命重要，因此在求取生命，避開死亡前，會先以義作為衡量，當不合義時便不會求取或避開，從正面論述捨生取義乃人之本心。
<br>再從反面假設人們都把生命視作最喜愛，把死亡視作最厭惡，那麼人們理應都會不擇手段、不顧禮義地求生避禍，但卻依然有人不願這樣做，從反面論述捨生取義乃人之本心。
<br>因而带出人最重視的是義，而並非生死。

一筐飯，一碗肉湯，得到就存活，得不到就死亡。大聲呼喝著給予，路人不會接受；踐踏著給予，乞丐不屑接受。萬鍾卻不辦別禮義就接受。
萬鍾對我來說有什麼好處？為了居所的華美、妻子妾女的服侍、讓所認識的窮乏之人感謝我的救濟宮室之嗎？過往寧願死亡也不接受，現在為了居所的華美而接受；過往寧願死亡也不接受，現在為了妻子的服侍而接受；過往寧願死亡也不接受，現在為了認識的窮乏之人感謝我的救濟而接受，這是不可以停止的嗎？這就是所謂失去他的本心了。

<br><br>
<br>
一碗飯、一碗肉湯

<br>呼喝著、踐踏著施予，饑餓的路人和乞丐也不會接受，因為不合禮義，所以即便死亡也在所不惜
<br>論證捨生取義的心人人都有，即使情況極為艱難，有生命危險的人也能堅守本心


<br>
萬鍾

<br>因為居所的華美、妻妾的服侍、認識自己的窮乏人士感激自己而不辦禮義便接受
<br>因為物質享受、生理欲望以及虛榮心而見利忘義
<br>論證人們喪失本心的原因在於受到利慾的誘惑


<br>↪️ 效果:<br>
<br>一筐飯、一碗湯: 更具體​​地展現人們擁有捨生取義之心的本性，即使瀕死之際面對食物的誘惑，也能堅守本心，寧死不受。
<br>萬鍾: 更具體地展現人們會因為各種利益和慾望的誘惑而迷失其中，喪失本心，捨義取利。
<br><br><br>
<br>路人乞丐

<br>面對困窘瀕死的處境依然能夠保持本心
<br>重視禮義多於生命


<br>受萬鍾之人<br>
- 在無關生死的狀況下捨義取利，接受不義之財<br>
- 重視利益多於禮義<br>
↪️ 目的: 強調受萬鍾之人受利慾薰心，喪失本性
<br><br>
<br>過往: 能夠捨生取義，堅守原則，不接受不合義的事情
<br>現在: 因為利慾的誘惑失去本性，不能持守故道<br>
↪️ 目的: 指出喪失本心的最主要原因是為了貪圖名利，論證見利忘義是喪失本心的表現
<br><br>
<br>身死: 指出身陷困境，生命垂危時尚能保持本心，不會為了求生而違背禮義，接受嗟來之食 (因為不合禮義)
<br>利慾: 面對名利這種身外之物卻為了滿足慾望而接受<br>
↪️ 目的: 對比死亡的嚴重性與利慾的微不足道，突出見利忘義的不合理
<br><br>
<br>人們見利忘義並非人性本惡，而是因為種種利益慾望才會喪失本心
<br>呼應全文中心論點，羞惡之心是人與生俱來的本性<br>
↪️ 「非獨賢者有是心也，人皆有之，賢者能勿喪耳。」

<br>一筐飯、一碗湯: 更具體​​地展現人們擁有捨生取義之心的本性，即使瀕死之際面對食物的誘惑，也能堅守本心，寧死不受。
<br>萬鍾: 更具體地展現人們會因為各種利益和慾望的誘惑而迷失其中，喪失本心，捨義取利。
<br><br><br>
<br>路人乞丐

<br>面對困窘瀕死的處境依然能夠保持本心
<br>重視禮義多於生命


<br>受萬鍾之人<br>
- 在無關生死的狀況下捨義取利，接受不義之財<br>
- 重視利益多於禮義<br>
↪️ 目的: 強調受萬鍾之人受利慾薰心，喪失本性
<br><br>
<br>過往: 能夠捨生取義，堅守原則，不接受不合義的事情
<br>現在: 因為利慾的誘惑失去本性，不能持守故道<br>
↪️ 目的: 指出喪失本心的最主要原因是為了貪圖名利，論證見利忘義是喪失本心的表現
<br><br>
<br>身死: 指出身陷困境，生命垂危時尚能保持本心，不會為了求生而違背禮義，接受嗟來之食 (因為不合禮義)
<br>利慾: 面對名利這種身外之物卻為了滿足慾望而接受<br>
↪️ 目的: 對比死亡的嚴重性與利慾的微不足道，突出見利忘義的不合理
<br><br>
<br>人們見利忘義並非人性本惡，而是因為種種利益慾望才會喪失本心
<br>呼應全文中心論點，羞惡之心是人與生俱來的本性<br>
↪️ 「非獨賢者有是心也，人皆有之，賢者能勿喪耳。」
第二段<br><br><br>
(a)   孟子曰:「魚，我所欲也，熊掌，亦我所欲也；二者不可得兼，舍魚而取熊掌者也。生亦我所欲也，義亦我所欲也；二者不可得兼，舍生而取義者也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
孟子說:「魚，是我想要的，熊掌，也是我想要的；兩者不能同時得到，便捨棄魚而選取熊掌。生命是我想要的，禮義也是我想要的；兩者不能同時得到，便捨棄生命而選取禮義。
<br>
<br>
比喻切入

<br>「魚」比喻生命 /「熊掌」比喻禮義
<br>比喻論證: 把艱深的哲理變得較為顯淺易明，令道理更為具體，令讀者易於明白抽象的概念。
<br>對比論證: 魚和熊掌都是美味的食物，但兩者不能同時得到時，會選擇熊掌。孟子透過兩者的對比，再指出生命 (魚) 和義 (熊掌) 兩者不能同時擁有時，會捨棄生命，選取義，以此立拾生取義之論。


<br>
人之本心

<br>人天生有「羞惡之心」，是人的本來就擁有的善性。
<br>特點: 將「禮義」看得比「生命」重要，在面對生命與禮義的抉擇時，認為禮義的價值更高，因此會願意捨生取義。
<br>目的:

<br>確立全文基調，明確帶出「人性本善」
<br>引出下文，帶出人不論面對什麼情況，都要懂得堅守本心




<br>字詞

<br>欲: 喜愛 / 想要
<br>得兼: 同时得到
<br>舍: 捨棄

<br><br><br>
(b)   生亦我所欲，所欲有甚於生者，故不為苟得也；死亦我所惡，所惡有甚於死者，故患有所不辟也。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
生命是我想要的，但有比生命更想要的事物，所以不會苟且偷生；死亡是我厭惡的，但有比死亡更嚴惡的事物，所以有的禍患不會逃避。
<br>
<br>正面論證

<br>「義」大於生命: 生命是自己想要的，但有比生命更想要的事物 (義)，所以不願意苟且偷生。
<br>「義」大於死亡: 死亡是自己厭惡的，但有比死亡更厭惡的事物 (不義)，所以不願意不擇手段逃避禍患。


<br>字詞

<br>生: 生命
<br>甚於: 超過於
<br>故: 所以
<br>為: 做 / 實行
<br>苟得: 苟且偷生
<br>死: 死亡
<br>惡: 厭惡
<br>患: 禍患 / 災难
<br>辟: 逃避 / 避開

<br><br>
(c)   如使人之所欲莫甚於生，則凡可以得生者，何不用也？使人之所惡莫甚於死者，則凡可以辟患者，何不為也？<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
假如人沒有比生命更想要的事物，那麼但凡可以求取生命的方法，為什麼不會接受呢?假如人沒有比死亡更厭惡的事物，那麼但凡可以逃避禍患的方法，為什麼不會做呢?
<br>
<br>反面論證

<br>求生手段: 生命最想要 → 求生而無所不為
<br>避患手段: 死亡最厭惡 → 逃避死亡而無所不為
<br>反問句效果: 能使文章氣勢更強盛，內容更有說服力


<br>字詞

<br>如使、使: 假如
<br>莫: 沒有
<br>則: 那麼
<br>凡: 但凡 / 凡是
<br>得生者: 求生的方法
<br>何: 為何
<br>用: 採用
<br>患: 禍患 / 災難
<br>為: 實行

<br><br>
(d)   由是則生而有不用也，由是則可以辟患而有不為也，是故所欲有甚於生者，所惡有甚於死者。非獨賢者有是心也，人皆有之，賢者能勿喪耳。<br>
━━━━━━━━━━<br>
根據這些事例，可以活命的方法竟然有人不接受，可以避開禍患的方法竟然有人不做，因為有比生命更想要的事物，有比死亡更厭惡的事物。不只有賢者有這樣的心態，人人都有，只是賢者能夠不喪失罷了。
<br>
<br>結論: 「義」比「生」可貴重要

<br>如果兩者不能兼得，應該捨生取義，不會為了求生避禍而捨棄義。


<br>承上啟下

<br>承接上文:「捨生取義」是人之本心，不是只有賢者才有本心，人人都有。
<br>開啟下文:「利欲薰心​​」的人們會因為利益而失去本心，唯有賢者能不受影響。

<br>字詞

<br>由是: 按照這样的方法
<br>則: 就能
<br>生: 求取生命
<br>而: 卻 / 但
<br>有: 有人
<br>是故: 因為
<br>非: 並非
<br>獨: 只有
<br>賢者: 賢明的人
<br>有是心: 有這樣的心態
<br>皆: 都
<br>能: 能夠
<br>勿喪: 不喪失
<br>耳: 罷了

<br><br>分析:<br>
<br>先從正面指出人視禮義比生命重要，因此在求取生命，避開死亡前，會先以義作為衡量，當不合義時便不會求取或避開，從正面論述捨生取義乃人之本心。
<br>再從反面假設人們都把生命視作最喜愛，把死亡視作最厭惡，那麼人們理應都會不擇手段、不顧禮義地求生避禍，但卻依然有人不願這樣做，從反面論述捨生取義乃人之本心。
<br>因而带出人最重視的是義，而並非生死。

 <br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, all our digital citizens. Let's confess - Has anyone here not utilized the powerful tool called ChatGPT before? Shook your head if you have never used this wonderful invention at all. Even our opponents today may have used AI to assist them writing the script. With its remarkable capabilities to work for humans instantly, we can't deny the fact that no one, including you and me, could be free from the hands of ChatGPT. Thus, our team line today is "Let's grow with ChatGPT", and our team are convinced that ChatGPT should be allowed in school.<br>The most significant rationale behind our belief is that this advanced learning platform boosts learning efficiency With the assistance of ChatGPT, students can access a vast amount of information and resources in a flash. Imagine you are struggling with a History essay about the consequences of World War II. With just a click, a well-written and informative piece of work can be churned out effortlessly. A recent survey conducted by a local youth organization that local students' stress mainly stems from the excessive amount of time on completing homework. Reducing time for homework has indeed allowed more entertainment and relaxation for teens, which also alleviate the problem of academic stress among our students in distress.<br>Apart from the efficacy provided by this innovative friend, it also vastly enhances the quality of learning. The interactive nature of ChatGPT allows students to engage in meaningful conversations and ask questions, leading to a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Who can deny the fact that ChatGPT just resembles a virtual teacher, who provide round-the-clock assistance to helpless learners? According to a survey launched by school(s), a majority of students admitted that ChatGPT has helped them grasp the textbook knowledge better as the tool provides personalized help to students with a specific question. Undeniably, students can grow and thrive with this amazing virtual teacher.<br>Our dear opponents may contend that students could become overly reliant on the technology, potentially hindering their independent and critical thinking skills. To address this concern, it is important to emphasize that ChatGPT should not replace traditional learning methods but rather complement them. It can serve as a valuable tool in a student's academic journey, providing additional support and guidance. Even top tertiary institution like HKU has allowed the use of ChatGPT in exams, acknowledging the necessity of using e-learning tool. They have adapted the assessment, such as carrying out oral discussion and changing question formats to allow critical thinking process(es) in exam. By encouraging students to engage critically with the information provided by ChatGPT, we can foster a healthy balance between utilizing technology and nurturing independent thinking skills.<br>Some scholars oppose the use of ChatGPT as they believe it may stifle learners' creativity and undermine their critical thinking skills. However, whether a double-edged sword becomes harmful depends on how we use it. If we can harness the power of an advanced learning tool to facilitate learning, it could instead encourage higher-order thinking. It parallels the advent of the Internet, which, like ChatGPT, can have both positive and negative effects on learning depending on its application. Top tertiary institution like the University of Hong Kong has positioned itself at the forefront of (the) digital era by allowing free access to generative AI, ChatGPT, even in examinations. While students are taught how to enhance their understanding of knowledge with the instant answering machine, they are also tested in different methods such as oral discussions and project-based assessments. The adaptation has guaranteed that learners can have a good grasp of subject matter while not being too reliant on the innovative technology.<br>As our team line "Let's grow with ChatGPT" suggests, this powerful learning tool is indispensable to learners' lives in this digital and ever-changing era. Our team strongly believes that by integrating ChatGPT into homework and assignments, we can create a more interactive and engaging learning environment, empowering students to explore subjects in greater depth and acquire valuable skills for the future. It is undeniable that technology is rapidly advancing, and as educators, it is our responsibility to adapt and harness its potential for the benefit of our students. As my explanations have come to an end, I would like to propose a question to our dear opponent, "Can you provide any ways that are more efficient than using ChatGPT to learn?" Thank you everyone and today the motion must stand.]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/artificial-intelligence-(debate).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Artificial intelligence (Debate).md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:49:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[One-sided argumentative]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Misery of Mankind - Why We Should Not Use AI<br>State-of-the-art and interactive chatbots, be it ChatGPT or Alexa, are permeating every part of our lives. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence and its potential to surpass human cognitive abilities have sparked a contentious debate. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has pointed out that "robots will do everything better than us", but he also asserted that "with AI we are summoning the demon." On the one-hand, advocates perceive this innovative and sophisticated technology as the key that opens the door to an in-depth learning voyage. On the other hand, sceptics deem that AI undermines our thinking skills, if not wrecking havoc on our fundamental cognitive development. It is strongly believed that the introduction of artificial intelligence is detrimental to the mankind, and the rationales will be explained as follows.<br>To commence with, artificial intelligence assistants stifle creativity, which is indispensable in the development of society. Despite being able to imitate our thinking, their minds are not going to beat up our vast and limitless imagination through complex neurons. Elon Musk imagines space travel, and hence he founded SpaceX. Steve Jobs originated phones and computers, and hence he established Apple. J.K. Rowling fantasizes about the magical world, and hence she wrote Harry Potter. It is undeniable that we harness our imagination to pave the way for world development. Nonetheless, these virtual assistants adopted rigid, ossified and predefined sets of rules, failing to invent beyond our intelligence. The more we rely on AI, the fewer creative and innovative inventors there will be. Without creativity and originality, advancement in all aspects, from arts to music, from economy to sustainable development, will cease. Coupled with our reliance on soulless AI, the lack of creativity in robotic automation will be detrimental to social development.<br>Besides, artificial intelligence may create the spread of inaccurate and false information. Despite the intention to provide reliable and accurate information to users, there are multiple instances in which these systems generate misleading and erroneous information for users. Research has shown that AI fails in basic logical reasoning, not to mention simple arithmetic calculations. What is worse, many users are under the false impression AI provides up-to-date information, without knowing that most only stores information before October in 2023. In addition to the malfunctions, some frauds (fraudsters?) even manipulate AI apps such as Deepfakes to impersonate celebrities and family members in video calls, in a bid to deceive victims and their families to pay. It is evident that AI systems could indeed foster the spread of disinformation, thereby triggering catastrophes, if not crimes. To make matters worse, their databases originated from the Internet, where content farms and yet-to-fact-check information flourish. In this line of thinking, fallacious and unfounded information spawned by these robots is indubitably adding fuel to the proliferation of misleading information.<br>Some critics argue that artificial intelligence provides a way for greater learning efficiency. It may sound plausible at first glance. Upon closer examination, however, it would be a misguided claim. Versatile as they are, artificial intelligence could swiftly generate answers to questions correspondingly. Thus, students of all ages will be tempted and succumb to the temptation by employing AI to complete their duties and assignments. As we are spoon-fed by these chatbots, without brainstorming and analyzing the issues by ourselves, our critical thinking and analytical skills will be marred. Not only would we lose the opportunity to embark on thoughtful exploration and debates, but we would also surrender our intrinsic curiosity and inborn ability. Take Photomaths as an example, which (where) the artificial intelligence programmed in the app is used by a raft of students to complete their mathematics assignments. Integration, factorization, and differentiation - you name it - can be solved easily by these bots. Nonetheless, learners would neither experience the thrill of reaching solutions nor gain profound insights. Undermining education goals, it is conspicuous that over-reliance towards AI places our problem-solving skills in peril.<br>Taking these factors into consideration, artificial intelligence is indeed a misery for mankind, jeopardizing creativity and the capacity for innovation, to name just a few issues. Although the development of artificial intelligence is inevitable, we should not overlook its potential risks and challenges. It is of paramount importance to address these concerns proactively to ensure that AI benefits humanity as a whole. It is high time we became the masters of AI, maintaining our own creativity and ensures that technology serves humanity's best interests.]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/artificial-intelligence-(essay).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Artificial intelligence (Essay).md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:49:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[School newsletter]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Master your own work<br>It has come to my attention that an increasing number of students at our school are submitting work that is not only synonymous in wording but also lacks originality. It is blatantly obvious a majority of junior form students submitted an almost identical and sterile work for the recent History take-home essay assignment, and our recently installed AI monitoring system has detected plagiarism from AI answering machine. This trend is disappointing, especially considering that out history team has implemented significant penalties for all instances of identical submission. As a history teacher who believes strongly in the values of creativity and academic integrity, I would like to raise students' awareness about this severe issue of using artificial intelligence to cheat and produce low-quality works.<br>First and foremost, relying on AI-generated content hampers students' (independent) thinking skills. The rationale behind assignments is to cultivate problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking skills. Recently, during a history take-home assignment on the question, "Was the Second World War unavoidable?" we were shocked to find that over half of the students provided similar responses that superficially acknowledged the complexity of the question without offering a coherent and convincing stance. The most common answer was "the question of whether the Second World War was unavoidable is complex and debated among historians.", which appeared to be directly copied from AI chatbots, filled with irrelevant facts that failed to address the question. This is just the tip of the iceberg; similar situations have emerged across all subjects, including science and humanities. Our recent summative assessments indicate that students struggle significantly with questions requiring critical thinking skills, demonstrating that AI tools like ChatGPT pose a real threat to students' intellectual development - a concern I take very seriously.<br>Apart from jeopardizing cognitive development of students, the use of AI also contributes to the spread of misinformation. Many students have submitted responses that, while seemingly well-structured, contain erroneous or outdated facts. A renowned research form The University of Cambridge shows that AI suffers from limitations with mathematical questions, not to mention that a lot of research has shown that response from AI spew nonsense and biased ideas. "1.11 is a bigger token than 1.9" is a common fallacy of AI answering machine, while we checked that the most recent social development in Hong Kong such as the ban on plastic cutlery is not even included in its database. All these inaccurate information raises serious concerns about the quality of information students are consuming and even relying on.<br>In light of the severe situation, I advise that students should take ownership of their work and embrace the creative and satisfying process of working things out. While AI can serve as a helpful complement to your studies, developing independent thinking skills is critical to your academic success and essential for problem-solving in the future. Be the master of your own marvelous work. Don't forget - you are not allowed to use any electronic device in the exam. With this line of thinking, using AI when doing homework equals chronic poisoning. As I am sure every student's goal is to achieve remarkable results in the exam, it would be undesirable to befriend with a tool that is taking a heavy toll on your studies.<br>To deter students from relying on AI to complete their work, our school will be adopting an advanced plagiarism checker to ensure that all students' work is original. Failing to submit original work may result in failing grades for those assignments. We believe this step is essential in promoting academic honesty and integrity. We understand that this measure might stir up anxiety among all our students, who have been inadvertently using AI or a lot of work. To complement our measure, a team of academic helpers would be assigned to all students who confront difficulties. When students are struggling with their homework, they can simply call our school or ask a question on our e-platform. It is believed that these measures will be highly conducive to students' learning.<br>In conclusion, I urge all students to reflect on the importance of originality in their work. I am sure every student is concerned about their homework, learning process and academic result. It is of utmost importance to develop a more positive and active style of learning. Let's work together to foster a culture of creativity and integrity that will serve us well in our academic journeys and beyond. Lastly, I look forward to splendid and well-written work from your next history assignment about World War II!]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/artificial-intelligence-&amp;-education.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Artificial intelligence &amp; Education.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:49:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence & Jobs]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
With the advancement of artificial intelligence, many suggest that human jobs will be replaced by artificial intelligence eventually.<br>
Write a debate speech for or against the following motion: "Artificial Intelligence will take away human jobs eventually."
<br>Good morning adjudicators, teachers and our respected opponents,<br>Today our motion is ‘Artificial Intelligence will take away human jobs eventually’. As the representative of the opposition side, I hold a firm belief that today’s motion is under no circumstances justifiable. Prior to elucidating our arguments, May I ask the affirmative side a few questions: who invented the artificial intelligence from the outset? In the absence of human beings, could the AI have prospered in recent decades? Without human beings’ intelligence and unrelenting effort in inventing AI, would we still be surrounded by such a vast array of convenient gadgets? Siri on Macbook, food-delivery robots, and the self-driving functions in Tesla – all of them are developed by the human beings. Ladies and gentlemen, our side’s argument is simple: we fervently believe that AI is wholly subject to human beings, and is inferior to human beings in terms of its capacity to handle high-order work. In no way can the robots supersede us.<br>Our respected affirmative side asserts that artificial intelligence is so smart that human beings will be threatened by their intelligence and efficiency. They claim that the AI robots have excellent logical and computational ability, and need not rest or have food like humans do, and thus they will supersede human beings in the workplace sooner or later. While the above argument seems logical at first glance, it does not hold much water at all if we examine it in great detail. Our respected affirmative, will you be highly cautious about using Siri on your phone, for fear that it will be smarter than you? Will you be intimidated by the automated driving system of Tesla? Will you consider the robot used in medical diagnosis a threat to all physicians? The answer is patently no, isn’t it? The aforementioned examples vividly illustrate that artificial intelligence is nothing more than administrative task assistants who can at best handle trivial or straight-forward tasks. Many artificial intelligence robots, programmed with the mere function to perform administrative work, cannot replace us completely. Also consider the AI machines in the operation theatres of hospitals. While they do help diagnose the types and positions of cancers in the patients, it is physicians who eventually conduct the final treatment, be it surgical removal or chemotherapy. So ladies and gentlemen, as we can see patently, human beings always take the dominant roles while the AI machines are nothing more than assistants of various kinds of work. On no account can AI take over human jobs completely.<br>In addition, what makes human beings stand out from the AI robots are our emotional intelligence, our empathy and sympathy, rather than our intellectual development. Some human jobs such as teachers, psychologists and social workers, lay great store by the intuitive natures that humans uniquely possess, such as empathy and sympathy. Our precious affirmative, do you genuinely reckon that AI robots possess such skills? If you’re not convinced, allow me to bring up the following scenario for your consideration: suppose now a student is crying in the middle of the class, losing control of his emotions and annoying his classmates, can the AI appreciate the emotions of the student, comfort him and get the class right back on track, under such extenuating and chaotic circumstances? Hard, if not impossible! On the contrary, it is the human teachers, filled with human emotions, empathy and sympathy, who could put the situation under control by demonstrating understanding to the student, empathising with the student, eventually calming him and resolving the whole crisis with ease! Given that human teachers have once been in the stages of toddlers, teenagers and growing adults, and are sapients who grow with experiences, they know exactly what to do when they are met with such difficulties! Without teachers’ help in facilitating the harmonic and holistic betterment of the class with human instincts, the class would be chaotic!<br>If it’s not sufficient to convince the affirmative side, let’s put yourselves in the shoes of other workers, say a psychologist or a social worker. When a psychologist or a social worker is conducting an appointment, treatment or examination for the patient and the patient suddenly bursts into tears or goes insane, would a robotic humanoid be patient enough to slowly talk some sense into the patient and manage to convince the patient to think positively? I’m afraid that the patients will simply disregard the robots, casting doubt on their capacity. In view of this, little room is there for debate that AI will not take away human jobs eventually.<br>Alongside the emotional intelligence of human beings, the other reason that leads to the inability of AI robots to replace human beings is that the former has a tendency to make mistakes, and it is for the human beings to remedy their defects. I suppose all of you are no stranger to the casualties caused by the self-driving functions of the electric vehicles Uber. Sophisticated as the self-driving technology is, not only has it crossed six red lights during a test, but it has even claimed the life of an innocent pedestrian in the US. Will you still dare to stand with the stance that the artificial intelligence can substitute human beings? If there had not been scientists to investigate and rectify the mistakes, more disastrous consequences would have cropped up! In other words, human beings do play an irreplaceable role in monitoring AI to ensure its smooth operation and unblemished performance of duties.]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/artificial-intelligence-&amp;-jobs.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Artificial intelligence &amp; Jobs.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Celebrity culture]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
Many pop singers or actors have become popular idols among teenagers. Some even regard them as role models.

<br>Write a debate speech.
<br>Argue for or against the motion that ‘pop singers or actors are suitable role models for teenagers.’

<br>Today our motion is ‘pop singers or actors are suitable role models for teenagers’. As the representative of the opposition side, I hold a firm belief that today’s motion is under no circumstances justifiable. Prior to delving into our arguments, may I take this opportunity to ask our respected affirmative a couple of questions: do most celebrities have a healthy body image? Do they have a good value judgment in general? Can they really convey positive messages to teenagers? The arguments of our side are simple: we fervently believe that most pop singers and actors distort the beauty perception and even the value judgment of society, and hence are not suitable role models for teenagers.<br>To begin with, the existence of pop stars is sending an erroneous message to the teenagers that having good physical beauty is tantamount to acquiring success. With the advancement of the beauty industry, virtually all pop stars nowadays have undergone cosmetic surgery, not to mention the heavy make-up they wear. They seek to present their perfect image of the goddess and hunky boy, rather than merely showing their most natural and authentic sides to the general public. Bombarded by the alluring and glamorous pop stars who frequently post their photos with slim bodies, big eyes, and prominent noses on social media, how can teenagers not be influenced by their elegance and feel comfortable with their imperfect appearances? As such, that teenagers conform to such unrealistically high beauty standard is nothing short of an inevitable result! Worse still, if teenagers fail to attain such a flawless appearance, they may even suffer from various illnesses, be they eating disorders or social appearance anxiety, just because they want to look as perfect as K-pop stars such as Lisa from Blackpink. Seen in this light, as a result of the unrealistic high beauty standard created by pop stars, they are definitely not suitable role models for teenagers.<br>In addition to that, what makes pop singers or actors not suitable to be role models for teenagers is that they may distort the value judgment of teenagers. Unlike adults who are mature enough to distinguish right from wrong, teenagers are immature to decide whether their idols do the right things for their value judgment is still developing. A case in point would be Kris Wu, who was involved in scandals about sexual harassment and taking drugs. While the evidence regarding his crimes was clearly posted on social media, many of his fans, who are only sixteen-year-old or seventeen-year-old, defended him and left comments like ‘even if he sexually harassed that girl, he did nothing wrong as long as he is not convicted as a criminal and sent to jail!’ and ‘ he is entrapped by the whistleblower, let’s save him from the police station and beat the whistleblower!’ Our dearest opponents, with pop stars of such distorted value judgment, do you still think that celebrities can be suitable role models for teenagers? Can you ensure that every pop star has a good morality? I’m not justifying that all pop stars have distorted value judgment and do bad things, but one celebrity who has significant influence like Kris Wu is already enough to put teenagers’ value judgment in jeopardy. That teenagers go astray and violate the laws are definitely the last things we want to see!<br>Our respected affirmative side asserts that the celebrities can be so inspirational that they will encourage teenagers to pursue their dreams and be more confident through sharing their own life experiences. While I do not deny that some pop stars may be inspirational, whether youngsters will truly be enlightened by them and become more confident is another story. Let’s be pragmatic and put yourself in the shoes of a typical youngster: will you truly compare yourselves to some young pop stars? Will you feel inferior just because you are not doing as well as them? Will you be less confident because you realize the gap between you and your idol? Only when teenagers have the money, resources, and opportunities as pop stars can they genuinely be confident to pursue their own dreams. Therefore, instead of being inspired by the life experiences of pop stars, teenagers are more likely to fall prey to comparing themselves to the triumphant pop stars in a negative way.<br>To conclude, pop singers or actors can distort teenagers’ beauty standard and value judgment. Let’s not forget that the primary responsibility of pop singers and actors is to entertain the audience. Being role models to inspire and educate teenagers is never their job. Therefore, pop singers or actors are not suitable role models for teenagers.]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/celebrity-culture.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Celebrity culture.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Letter to the Editor]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Dear Editor,<br>Having read the recent JPEX scandals, as a technician, I am concerned about the rise of scams in Hong Kong. Pressing as it is, recent statistics by the Hong Kong Police Force indicate that there were nearly 20,000 reported scam cases in the first half of 2024, accounting for approximately 50% of all crimes in Hong Kong in 2024. What add fuels to this this the total financial loss from these scams, which reached a staggering HK$4.48 billion and marked a 66.5% increase from the previous year. In light of this alarming trend, I am writing to exemplify the underlying cause and shed light on the plausible solutions.<br>A primary reason for the prevalence of scams is low public awareness towards fraud tactics. Many individuals, particularly younger populations and senior citizens, may not fully understand and recognize scams. Not only do the scammers pose as deliveryman from SF express, but they also disguise as immigration officers of staff from Bank of China. The aftermath is that victims are often misled into providing personal information, ranging from credit card numbers to bank account passwords. It was already too late when the victims realised they were scammed. The problem is further exacerbated by the sophistication of modern scams, which can be highly convincing and tailored to exploit the trust and naivety of unsuspecting victims. Without the scepticism towards scams, no wonder why many prudent Hongkongers have become gullible and have fallen victim to scams nowadays.<br>Apart from citizens not being vigilant against scam, advanced and sophisticated technology is attributed to the alarming rise of scams. The advancement of artificial intelligence and deepfake technology has enabled fraudsters to craft remarkably convincing impersonations of government officials and celebrities to deceive the vulnerable public. Among the 16183 cases of technology-related crimes, one prominent incident saw a multinational firm employee duped during a video conference, leading to a staggering HK$200 million loss due to the spread of company's confidential information. Senior citizens, who are not proficient in technology, are particularly susceptible to those technology-induced scams. As scammers leverage these advanced tools deceive victims, the challenge of combating technology-driven fraud becomes increasingly daunting.<br>The lack of awareness and vigilance can be attributed to insufficient educational initiatives targeting vulnerable groups, particularly teenagers and young adults who are more likely to engage with digital platforms where these scams are prevalent. Without proper guidance and awareness campaigns, these individuals may not possess the know-how to identify and avoid such deceptive practices. To combat this issue effectively, two solutions can be implemented.<br>To begin with, education targeting teens should be launched immediately. To do so, educational institutions should integrate comprehensive anti-scam education into their curricula. One effective approach for students to identify scams would be to invite professionals from relevant fields to deliver workshops and seminars. While police officers could share real-life case studies of scams and highlight the tactics used by fraudsters and the devastating impacts experience by victims, financial experts, meanwhile, could guide safe online banking practices, spotting phishing attempts, and securing personal information. These educational sessions could also incorporate role-playing exercises, such as launching drills with internal emails, where students actively participate in scenarios simulating scam attempts. By immersing themselves in these interactive activities, students can develop a better understanding of scams and potential responses to deter scams. This hands-on approach can instil a sense of vigilance among the younger generation, making them less susceptible to fraud.<br>Besides, anti-scam campaigns should be organized. Initiatives like the mascot "The Little Grape" can serve as an effective model for broader anti-scam efforts. This campaign specifically targets young people using engaging content that resonates with their experiences and concerns. The campaign could utilize social media platforms popular among teens to disseminate information about common scams and how to avoid them. Additionally, collaboration with local businesses to create promotional materials - such as posters or videos - can enhance visibility and reach within communities. The Hong Kong Police Force's "Anti-Scam Month" campaign is another example where targeted outreach efforts are made through various channels to raise awareness about scam tactics. Compounding these efforts, these campaigns can significantly expand the reach and impact of educational initiatives, ultimately engendering a more informed public and better equipping them to safeguard themselves against the rising tide of scams in Hong Kong.<br>In conclusion, addressing scams in Hong Kong requires a multifaceted approach that includes enhancing public awareness through education and targeted campaigns. By raising the awareness of the vulnerable groups, we can significantly reduce the incidence of scams and protect our community from financial harm. It is crucial that we act now, not later, to equip both junior and senior members of society with the knowledge they need to safeguard themselves against these deceptive practices.<br>Yours faithfully,<br>

 <br><br>Dear Editor,<br>I am writing to express my concern regarding the alarming rise of vaping among teenagers in Hong Kong, particularly the use of "space oil", which is often disguised as e-cigarette capsules. This dangerous trend has been highlighted in recent headlines, with juveniles arrested for possessing and selling these drugs. Such incidents underscore the urgent need for action. The rise in vaping among our youth is fuelled by insufficient awareness of the risks associated with these substances and the natural curiosity of young people. To examine the issue and raise citizens' awareness of this dangerous drug, I will first explain what attributes to the trend, followed by practical solutions to mitigate the severity of the issue.<br>The major reason why teens are attracted to "space oil" is indeed the lack of awareness about its dangers. Many teenagers do not realize that "space oil" contains harmful drugs like etomidate, an anesthetic that is illegal to possess without a prescription. This ignorance can lead to experimentation, putting their health at significant risk. A recent survey of the Youth Council reveals that most teenagers have not heard about the potential health risks of space oil, and drug takers have attempted the drug due to curiosity. While it is crucial that we address this gap in understanding before it leads to more severe consequences, we should be aware of the low awareness of drugs among teenagers.<br>To combat this issue, I propose two key solutions to both schools and government. First, the government, as the leader of society, should step up efforts to launch a comprehensive anti-vaping campaign in schools. This initiative could involve peer ambassadors who educate their classmates about the dangers of vaping and encourage them to report any drug use. It is suggested that an insightful talk held by experts on drugs should be organized. With this talk, students can gain an insight into the fact that taking space oil is synonymous with taking drugs. After raising their awareness, there should be activities such as game booths for students to know the health risks of space oil. By empowering students to take an active role in their health education, we can foster a culture of awareness and responsibility.<br>Second, the government should leverage social media platforms, especially Instagram, where adolescents are most active, to disseminate information about the risks of vaping and drug use. It is revealed by many companies that using social media platform such as Instagram can effectively raise teenagers' awareness on the topic that they are advertising. The government can invite idols such as Keung To do endorse the idea that space oil is detrimental to health. Engaging advertisements that resonate with young people can effectively capture their attention and inform them about the dangers of substances like "space oil".<br>By implementing these solutions, we can help prevent our youth from the dangers of vaping and drug use. It is vital that we act now to ensure a healthier future for our teenagers. As teenagers are future pillars of society, both the government and schools should make collaborative efforts in combating the severe trend that may put thousands of innocent teenagers into jeopardy.<br>Yours faithfully,<br>

 <br><br>Dear Editor,<br>The recent ban on single-use plastics in Hong Kong has sparked a heated debate among residents and the catering industry. Topics like "Soggy paper utensils" and "unusable paper straws" often hit the headlines. As the city grapples with the challenges of sustainability, this abrupt policy shift has raised significant concerns regarding its practicality and impact on daily life. While the intention to reduce plastic waste is commendable, the practice appears to overlook the realities faced by many citizens. Thus, I am writing to express my views on why this policy is undesirable and unfavorable to the city as a whole.<br>To commence with, the policy has brought immense inconvenience to city dwellers. Many news reports and interview articles indicate that a considerable majority of takeaway customers find the new regulations highly inconvenient. Many have expressed frustration with the paper utensils provided by major chains, such as McDonald's, which tend to be unwieldy pronounced for construction workers and other laborers who rely heavily on lunch boxes, as the lack of adequate utensils creates substantial obstacles for city dwellers seeking quick meal solutions during their busy workdays, not to mention students who have to rush through their lunch hours. It is undeniable the drawbacks of the policies outweigh the benefits.<br>Moreover, this policy places an unfair financial burden on low-income groups. To align with the new regulations, eateries are likely to pass on the increased costs associated with eco-friendly alternatives to consumers. For those already struggling to make ends meet, the additional expense of purchasing disposable wooden or paper utensils can surge quickly. A recent survey published by South China Morning Post reveals that a majority of blue collars like construction workers reckon that the $2 charges imposed on plastic utensils pose a daily financial burden to them. This shift not only widens the wealth gap but also add fuels to the challenges confronted by many low-income groups. It is crucial that we consider the financial realities of all Hongkongers, particularly those who work tirelessly to provide for their families.<br>While some proponents of the ban may argue that it is a step toward a more environmentally friendly future, there are more effective alternatives that could be pursued without imposing undue hardship on residents. For instance, promoting the use of reusable bag and utensils could be a viable compromise, allowing individuals to make sustainable choices without the inconveniences associated with paper cutlery. To achieve this, it is suggested the government sends a box of free utensils to every household to encourage the use of reusable cutlery. Also, reusable bags can be provided in the first stage of eco-friendly campaign, incentivizing citizens to adopt a green lifestyle. While being eco-friendly is an integral part of modern citizens, it should never come at the cost of placing burden on low-income groups. It is essential that any environmental initiative we undertake is equitable and practical, ensuring that it serves the needs of all citizens rather than creating new barriers.<br>In conclusion, while the intention behind the ban on single-use plastics is commendable, its implementation requires careful reconsideration. We must prioritize the convenience and financial well-being of Hongkongers, seeking solutions that genuinely foster sustainability without compromising daily life. I urge our policymakers to engage with community and explore alternatives that balance ecological responsibility with practical needs. In short, it is of paramount importance to lead (the) eco-friendly trend, but the well-being of our Hong Kong citizens should be at the top of agenda.<br>Yours faithfully,<br>

 <br>
In light of the soaring unemployment rate, the government has proposed to subsidise $10,000 to some employers that are hiring talents. Should the government subsidise companies in the business sectors, or companies in the arts industry?

<br>Write a debate speech.
<br>Argue whether the government should subsidise companies in the business sector or companies in the arts industry.

<br>Good morning adjudicators and our respected opponents,<br>Today our debate motion is “whether the government should subsidize companies in business sectors, or companies in the art industry. As the representative of the latter, I hold a firm belief that the arts industry is under all circumstances worth investing. Prior to elucidating my arguments, may I take this opportunities to ask our respected opponents a couple of questions: How much has the government invested in the business sector from the outset of pandemic? In the absence of arts, could Hong Kong be dubbed as a “Vibrant cultural diversified city”? The answer is patently a “no”. Ladies and gentlemen, our side’s argument is simple: We fervently believe that the arts industry is currently in dire straits and only through subsidising art companies, namely music, film, design or visual arts industries could we retain these talents in our metropolis. In no way should the business sector outweigh the value of arts.<br>In commence with, subsidizing the arts industry is tantamount to retaining the cultural diversity of Hong Kong. Let’s take a closer look at the local TV film and industry. In the wake of the pandemic, many if not all, business companies have shifted to a “work from home” mode, in which their employees are able to contribute without having to go to the office. However, our precious opponents, do you genuinely think that those working in the arts industry are as lucky to be able to earn a living under such a hard time, when all such filming is forced to terminate, coupled with a high risk of infection of the virus? If you’re not convicted, allow me to bring up the current situation in the film industry for your consideration: all cinemas have been closed for more than half a year and in no way should the film companies release their product to the public, let alone to generate revenue for their companies. Seen in this light, an array of small local film companies are teetering at the brink of bankruptcy. Had there not been any subsidy provided to the arts industry, it would lead to a further crackdown of cultural diversity, in the sense that hiring local talents requires an enormous investment for training and performance. Not only could subsidising the arts industry ease the tension stemming from financial burden in the short term, but it could also go a long way towards local cultural development in the long run. As a local citizen, we don’t have to exaggerate in saying that subsidising the arts industry could stamp out the soaring unemployment rate, but suffice for us to conclude that the art pieces created by art companies could retain the cultural diversity.<br>Standing alongside the cultural development, what makes it important to subsidise the arts industry as opposed to the business sector is that the former contributes to the enhancement of community cohesion. Gone are the days when street performance of arts, such as busking, photographing, calligraphy or arts painting, was nothing short of the daily activities of artists. Lamentably, all these no longer exist. I suppose all of you are no stranger to the abolition of Sai Yeung Street pedestrian district in Mong Kok, as a result of which hundreds of musicians and artists are left with no choice but to lose their jobs. Compared to the business sectors, which have been flourishing over the years and possess a glamorous and affluent facade, the compares in the arts industry are no longer perceived as a crucial constituent in society. What has been disregarded by the government is the unremitting efforts contributed by the artists behind the financial hub. Imagine yourself being a manager of artists and where your artists can perform is merely confined to the streets in Mong Kok or Tsim Sha Tsui. Would you not feel isolated or demoralised for being overlooked by society or the government when all your blood, sweat and tears devoted to music training are all in no vain? While I do not deny that business sectors have their own economic value to be subsidized, it is also worth noticing that no account should the government turn a blind eye to the arts industry and pay undue emphasis on business development.<br>Our respected opponent asserts that business sector should under all circumstances be subsidised, as they are so important that not only do business companies form the backbone of local economic growth, but they are also the only way out to ameliorate the unemployment rate. While the above argument seems logical at first glance, may I warn the opponents that this is actually a false logical deduction – subsidising the business sector does not necessarily lead to the elimination of the unemployment problem. Let’s be pragmatic: If you were a Human Resources manager of a business company, how would you spend the subsidy wisely in hopes of maximizing the profit gain? Would you hire local graduates or international talents from around the world? I believe any reasonable man would choose the latter, for international business talents are more competitive than the local ones. In this sense, isn’t it preposterous to claim that local unemployment rate could be alleviated? After all, the arts industry are more worth subsidising, given that there are a plethora of young and unemployed artists who are so talented that they excel in multifarious aspects, ranging from music, drawing to acting. Were we to think about the large number of beneficiaries, we could recognise that the art industry should be the one being subsidised.<br>All in all, let us forget that arts are equally important to economic development and it is high time the government laid great store by local cultural development. We urge the opponents not to be too doom and gloom, underestimate the number of people that benefit from the subsidy. Once again, it is our firm conviction that the companies of arts industry should be subsidized. Thank you!]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/employment-business-or-arts.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Employment - Business or arts.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fairness issue (infringement of copyrights)]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
As captain of the debate team you have been asked to write a debate speech. The task is to argue whether individuals who illegally share music online should be put in jail. Write the speech and include three reasons to support your stance.
<br>Good morning adjudicators, teachers and our respected opponents,<br>Today our debate motion is ‘whether individuals who illegally share music online should be put in jail’. As a representative of the opposition side, I hold a firm belief that under no circumstances should people who illegally share music online be put in jail. Prior to elucidating my arguments, may I take this opportunity to ask our respected affirmative side a couple of questions: Can you vouch that you have never forwarded any copyrighted music on social media? Won’t you feel deflated when you listen to a pleasant pop song yet cannot share it with your best friends online, for fear that you will end up behind the bars? Can you imagine how many teenagers‘ lives will be ruined if this ludicrous policy is implemented, as sharing music is already a norm to them nowadays? Ladies and gentlemen, our side’s argument is simple: We fervently believe that the consequence of putting one in jail after illegally sharing music online is so unreasonable that the general citizens’ welfare will be compromised, and the development of the local music industry will also be put in jeopardy.<br>To commence with, putting individuals who illegally share music online is tantamount to jeopardizing a majority of kids and teenagers‘ future. Under this technology-dominated era and the impact of globalization, everyone can have access to music videos from all around the world at their fingertips, such as through YouTube or Spotify. Unlike mature adults who know well about the laws which are against piracy, kids or teenagers at a tender age usually lack awareness about the legal consequences of breaching copyrights. Coupled with the popularity of famous pop singers like Billie Ellish and Ariana Grande among juveniles nowadays, sharing their music online has already become commonplace among the teens. So may I ask our opponents to put themselves into the shoes of these youngsters: If this policy is set up, can you picture how your entire future is crippled by ending up in jail, only because of your accidental sharing of copyrighted music online? Won’t this experience be such a heavy blow to your life even after you have left the jail, when you recollect how your naive intention of spreading good music to others caused you to be in jail? Compared to mere financial penalty, the legal consequence of putting individuals in jail is simply too unreasonable, if not ludicrous / ridiculous / preposterous especially when the act of breaching copyrights has nothing to do with severe crimes liking robbing or murdering. As we can see, little room is left to debate that this policy definitely should not be passed at the expense of / to the detriment of youngsters‘ future.<br>Apart from the deleterious impact this policy has on adolescents' future, on no account should we overlook the fact that this policy serves as an impediment to / a hindrance to / a hurdle to / a barrier to / a stumbling block to the development of the local music industry. I admit that the initiative of this policy, which is to protect artists‘ copyrights and the originality of their work, is commendable itself. However, can we take a moment to envisage what will happen if no one shares copyrighted songs on Instagram, Youtube or Twitter anymore? Nowadays, virtually everyone is sharing the copyrighted music of their idols online, whether it be Mirror band‘s music videos or Hins Cheung’s and Serrini’s sentimental songs. According to a user experience survey conducted by Instagram, more than 70% teens share copyrighted music on their Instagram profile through posts or stories. By doing this, people can spread the positive motifs of the songs, glorify the stunning visuals or lyrics of the music videos, and accentuate the importance of local music. However, think about what will happen if they are to put in jail after sharing copyrighted songs! With such significant deterrent effects, they will cease sharing music undeniably, in a bid to prevent bearing such deplorable legal consequences! Very soon, little will people know and recognize the local pop music, given that there will be no one sharing music online. In other words, this policy is nothing more than a hindrance to the development of local music.<br>The affirmative side may contend that individuals who illegally share music online should be put in jail, in the sense that this punishment is threatening enough to prevent people from infringing copyrights by sharing music online. While the above argument seems logical at first glance, it does not hold water at all if we examine the argument in great detail — putting individuals who illegally share music in jail cannot indoctrinate the public with the moral of respecting artists‘ creations at all. According to the research of Federation Youth Group, around 70% of teenagers labour under the misconception that sharing copyrighted music online does no harm to its creators. This clearly manifests that it is juveniles’ lack of knowledge about the issue of copyrights that leads to their behavior of illegally sharing music online. However, putting people who do that in jail cannot instill knowledge about copyrights into the public, such as how important copyrights are, and what to do to protect copyrights. It can at best pose a deterrent effect to dissuade people from doing so in the short term, but it is not a long-term solution, considering that a majority of people still don‘t have a deeper grasp about the copyright issue. In this sense, isn’t it preposterous to claim that this policy can solve the root of the problem and can efficiently put a halt to people‘s act of illegally sharing music online? After all, when we take a panoramic view to this issue, we can easily conceive that rather than really making people learn to protect copyrights, this policy only threatens them not to commit crime. Thus, I suppose any reasonable man would believe that this policy is definitely not the perfect antidote to the problem of piracy.<br>All in all, judging from the well-documented analysis above, our side holds a firm conviction that putting individuals who illegally share music in jail is not an ideal policy. Therefore, may we urge our dearest opponents not to overlook the drawbacks of the policy, but also to ponder other better alternative ways to contend with piracy. Thank you!]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/fairness-issue-(infringement-of-copyrights).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Fairness issue (infringement of copyrights).md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Families are not close as they used to be]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
It has been revealed in news articles that many families are not as close as they used to be.

<br>Write a letter to the editor.
<br>Explain why family relationships are getting worse and suggest how family relationships can be improved.

<br>(Social issues?)<br>Dear editor,<br>I am writing this letter regarding the recent news article “demising family”, which discussed the alarming phenomenon that family members are drifting apart from each other, and I could not agree more. Hence, I would like to shed light on the rationale behind and suggest a solution that helps restore family harmony.<br>To start with, I believe it is the addiction to technological gadgets that makes family members start to be indifferent to one another. Back in the old good days were the parents and children gathering in front of the television to enjoy the show together, sharing daily trivialities with one another while binge-watching different soap dramas. However, with the advent of smartphones, all these have flown out of the window. With the compact boxes in hands, as opposed to watching TV shows together in sofa, they now view their favorite YouTube videos in their own locked rooms, depriving them of the chance to communicate. What piles on the gloom is that nowadays adolescents are so obsessed with the internet that they share things online instead of talking to their parents. Be it the misfortune they encounter or the little grace they receive, teenagers tend to post it on social media like Facebook and Instagram rather than sharing the news with their parents, killing the last opportunity to have a conversation. Gradually, an invisible wall is established between parents and children, making them stand aloof from one another.<br>Now that we know the problem originates from the addiction to technology, we can formulate a plan to counter it, with adding family hours and merging the individual virtual worlds into a communal social place being the first and foremost. Amid the family hours, family can watch their children’s favorite Netflix shows on TV. Sitting in a comfy sofa shoulder by shoulder, sharing the same cup of popcorns and laughing together at the plot can create a sense of intimacy. Better still, the show grants them a common topic to elaborate on, comments on the actors’ appearance and discussion on the plots can be easily induced, creating room for interactions. Apart from watching Netflix and chill, family can play games like Supermario Party or Just Dance. Through playing these interactive games, a lot of laughter can be sparked. All these shared gaming experience will further pull the family members closer.<br>All in all, technology is our best friend and our worst enemy concurrently. It is a sharp knife that cuts the connection, fragmenting the family, but it is also the bridge that joins the isolated islands together into an integral family, holding them together firmer than ever. It is high time we utilized technology wisely to savor the family relationship before it goes beyond remedy, instead of allowing technology to erode our family bonds. It is hoped that the lamentable manifestation of shattering family can soon be erased.<br>Yours faithfully,<br>

 <br>
You have participated in a debate competition. Write a debate speech for or against the motion ‘that students should be given a gap year before the start of university to explore their own interests’.
<br><br>Good morning adjudicators, fellow opponents, ladies and gentlemen,<br>Today’s motion ‘that students should be given a gap year before the start of university to explore their own interests’. I am the first speaker of the affirmative side. Our team firmly believe that the motion shall stand, based on three main arguments - the essential time demanded for revitalisation, benefits on whole-person development, and the practical need for consideration of students’ career choices.<br>To begin with, having a gap year before entering the unfamiliar while challenging chapter of life in university is crucial for the mental well-being of students. Imagine devoting relentless effort to preparing for the public examination, working day and night for three continuous years in senior forms of secondary school, doing countless exercises and drillings, and going through your notes over and over. Such mode of studying is for sure, mentally exhausting and frustrating, with the constant stress upon students to push their limits in order to strive for academic excellence. According to the survey on mental health of secondary school graduates conducted by the Mental Health Association of Hong Kong, an organisation concerned about the psychological well-being of citizens, over 84% of respondents experience frequent mood-swings, with 73% of them suggesting academic pressure as major source of the issue, while more than 80% of them believe that a resting period longer than 7 months would be beneficial to them. It is totally understandable that when the mentally-draining revision eventually comes to an end with the public exam, many would find themselves desperate for an extended period of time to take a break. After years of putting countless effort in their education and passing the nearly traumatising examination in their lives, shouldn’t students deserve to receive adequate time for rest? Not only can students refresh their minds from the previous exhaustion through having a gap year, but they can also enjoy their lives for a while, leaving academics aside, and thereby, fully charged again to be ready for their university after the gap year.<br>Apart from serving as the period for revitalisation, another prominent reason for providing a gap year before students step into university is to complement the unique life experiences lost under the current education system. Contrary to popular perception of a gap year which many erroneously presumed it purely as an extended holiday promoting the idling tendency within teenagers, gap year is in fact, productive and fruitful. Secondary school graduates are allowed sufficient time to freely explore various specks of life, with a whole year blanked for them to fill in with their own colours. I would like to raise a few questions for our fellow opponents: in senior forms of secondary school, have you ever had months to travel to foreign countries, immersing in cultures completely different from local environment? Have you been given multiple weeks just to enrolling in extra-curricular courses to acquire new skills or develop special personal interests, from video editing to stargazing? And have you been able to take internship so to be more prepared for your future career? The answer is clearly no. Students are barely given any opportunities for students to discover their own potentials in today’s society which is so stressed on academic excellence that almost every minute of the graduates’ previous years have been occupied by studying. Given that many seldom have time to dig into other aspects of life, having a gap year undeniably compensate those missing pieces by enriching their experiences. Therefore, our team hold strong belief that a gap year, boosting the personal growth of students, should be allowed before the beginning of university.<br>While our fellow opponents may contend that delaying university study for a year would leave students a retarded progress on reaching their life goals, such claim is absolutely untenable. The prerequisite for one to be ‘in progress’ is that the person has determined clear and concrete goals to achieve. Yet, the cruel reality is quite the opposite – only a few of the many have figured out their desired career pathways before choosing their university majors. With teachers busily going through textbook content at school and students revising and attending tutorial classes after school in order to keep up with the exam- oriented teaching, it is unsurprising that students merely care about their future career, comparing to fulfilling the urgent deadlines lying right in front of them, and invest little time to discover their true dreams. The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, a youth organisation concerned about the career planning of youngsters, conducted a survey after the public examination, in which over 75% of respondents express that they have only begun to research on university subjects at the verge of taking their study leaves. We all understand that hardly can students grasp a comprehensive view of the huge variety of possible choices for their university majors in such a short period of time. Then, may I sincerely ask our respected opponents a few questions: what is the purpose of forcing students to seamlessly promote to university if they have not even clarify their own directions? Isn’t it disheartening to see generations of graduates wasting their precious teenage years, struggling among obscure academic papers and demanding assignments for the knowledge that they have zero interest in? What is the point of navigating in the ocean along a route that we know it will never lead us to our desired destination? Apparently, a gap year is certainly necessary for students as a time for reflection, to learn about themselves and figure out their own dreams, rather than entering the university knowing that they would be tormented for years due to a hastily-made decision.<br>In conclusion, our side have solid grounds supporting the motion ‘that students should be given a gap year before the start of university to explore their own interests’. Students should be granted their deserved resting time to improve their mental well-being, enrich their experiences apart from academics and carefully considering their career planning. Therefore, today’s motion must stand. Thank you.<br><br>Good morning adjudicators, ladies and gentlemen,<br>Today our motion is ‘that secondary school graduates should be given a gap year before embarking on their university journey’. As the representative of the affirmative side, I believe that today’s motion must under all circumstances justifiable. Before elucidating my arguments, I would like to first clarify the main purpose of having a gap year and why it is beneficial to secondary school graduates. Our side would like to make clear that a gap year is diametrically different from an annual holiday in which one is given abundant room for taking a long break from the overwhelming workload. Rather, it is a means for one to take concrete steps to explore and realize his own dreams before furthering his studies in the university. Our side firmly believes that the gap year is so meaningful that every secondary school graduate should give it a go.<br>First and foremost, having a gap year before one furthers his studies in the university is conducive to figuring out one’s genuine dreams and potentials. Before I elaborate, allow me to raise a couple of questions for the opposition side’s consideration: do you genuinely understand what your personal interest is and which path you should opt for at the time of your secondary graduation? Do you have a firm decision of which programme to enroll in? Are you sure you are passionate about the subjects you have put in your JUPAS choices? Our precious opponent, we both know that the answers are, lamentably, in the negative. Let’s confess the downside of our education system: rather than planning our career paths from day one, schools have merely been accentuating the importance of getting good grades in our exams. No one ever tells us which path to opt for, and the stark truth is that everyone is merely clinging to society’s expectations, with all high-flyers ending up in law and medical schools. Aren’t these pathetic in such a modern society, when we human beings are supposed to live our lives to the fullest and have our dream materialised? Having a gap year, therefore, is a perfect antidote to this problem. Not only can graduates gain more job experience by taking part in some apprenticeship programmes in the fields they may be interested in, but they can also travel around the globe and gain a better understanding of the culture of different countries. With a broadened horizon, they will have a firm grasp of what they are genuinely passionate about. On the contrary, if one studies in the university directly before confirming whether they are enthusiastic about that discipline, it may happen that they end up wasting the whole four years reading something they are apathetic about. As we can see clearly, having a gap year is the fundamental step one should take in a bid to make clear about his goals.<br>The opposition side may contend that, they should complete the tertiary education as soon as possible and should not have their valuable time wasted by having a gap year. While we do not deny that the acquisition of a university degree is essential, our team asserts that to recognize one’s dream is definitely of higher urgency and importance. Have you all wondered how sinister the consequences can be should one fail to recognize his own dream before embarking on their university journey? It is highly likely that he gets into a subject which he is apathetic about! It will be too late for one to stay ignorant until his university life has already begun! By then, he will have to drop out from schools, or worse still, have four years of university life filled with unhappiness, pain and torture! Having such lamentable trajectory is definitely the last thing we would like to see! Nonetheless, all these could have been avoided from the outset if one had been given a gap year prior to the commencement of university, during which they are given ample time to stay mindful with themselves, appreciate their own desires, and discover their lifelong goals. Our respected opponent, we would like to highlight that we are not proposing one to skip the university after the gap year; instead, what we are suggesting here is that both of them should co-exist harmoniously, with gap year being followed by the university life. Isn’t it absurd for you to reject such a proposal, which caters for both individuals’ pursuit of dreams as well as career pathways?<br>Our dearest opponent, you may also argue that, the university would simply work as well as having a gap year if one aimed at exploring his future possibilities. This may not be surprising though, as university does offer students a high degree of flexibility with loose study schedule. On the face of it, students are given much room to discover their own enthusiasm and passion. Nonetheless, our side is afraid that the opposite side does not have a comprehensive picture of what university students are faced with authentically. Our precious opponent, let’s be realistic – do students genuinely have such abundant time for self-discovery given their hectic extra-curricular activities? We all know that university students never merely complete their degree curriculum with a marginal pass – not only should one acquire excellent academic standing, one also has to simultaneously brush up his technical knowledge, through partaking in tons of case competitions, internships and group projects throughout the university life. Many are also actively engaged in hall and society activities, taking up essential leadership roles with a view to enhancing their overall competitive edge. Considering all the above, may I once again ask our dearest opponent – do you really think that they have sufficient time to explore their potential?<br>
To conclude, our side believes that a gap year serves as a perfect avenue for students to explore his own potential and prevent all adverse consequences of choosing a wrong discipline in the university. Today’s motion must be under all circumstances justifiable. Thank you!]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/gap-year.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Gap Year.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sample 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>
Your year group has been asked to produce student essays about yourselves for a school display on graduating students. Think of three events that show significant moments in your school life and write your essay. Write one paragraph for each event, describing the moments and explaining why that moment is significant to you. You may write on these three events:

<br>Your first school day
<br>Christmas singing contest
<br>Graduation Day

<br>Time flies in the blink of an eye and now every tick of the clock is bringing the graduation closer. Although the past six years passed like a sweet dream, the memories are real. All those good old days have transformed the once innocent boy into a mature man who is ready to navigate any obstacles. Rewind to the past and we’ll discover there are moments that send me pangs of nostalgia...... Marking the start of my voyage in this school is the student photo taken on the first school day. I remember the day I entered the school gate with tiny but heavy steps, exploring a whole new world in this campus. Everything was obscured by a fog of mystery and I had to step into the unknown as a freshman. Without the companionship of friends, travelling along the corridor alone was the only choice left for me. The corridor was so long that it seemed like an endless tunnel and I started getting butterflies in my stomach on my way to phototaking. Yet, I had to act like amature secondary student so I mustered the courage to maintain my poise. Swallowing the trepidation, I took my very first photo in this school. “3,2,1, smile.” I squeezed an awkward smile which was tinged with a bit of apprehension and a pulse of anticipation and my journey had since begun.<br>Since then, I met a lot of friends and cultivated strong bonds with them — I never ever had to walk along the corridor by myself again. Our unbreakable friendship is reflected in the next photo taken on the Christmas singing contest. Inside the frame, we were holding hands in hands. Everyone was bearing the brightest grin on stage, presenting our fruit of hard work to the audience. Though we were no prodigies in music, we were determined to create an original song that carried our memories in the past six years. We formulated the melody notes by notes, revising it thousands of times and making modifications to perfect the music. We joined our emotions together and translated them into words, writing all the tears and laughter into the lyrics. Finally, a song named “Butterfly Effect” was born. Just like the meaning of its name that a small effect can trigger a series of events, our encounter had altered our life trajectories. Our fates had intertwined together since the day we met. Our fellowship had become so deep that we became inseparable buddies. By looking at the photo, I can still feel the music humming in my ears and the lyrics lingering on my lips. Thanks to your companionship along the journey, I am no longer lonely.<br>However, every journey has a destination and my secondary school life is no different. Stating the end of my school fantasy is the photo taken on the graduation day. On that memorable day, we were not only tossing our graduation caps into the blue sky, but also throwing away the years of past paper drilling, letting go of the nights we spent for preparing the examinations, discarding the days when we spared no efforts to strive for a place in universities, forgetting the moments we fought against the formidable DSE together as the most supportive team, and finally, saying goodbye to our wonderful secondary school life. Graduation was indeed the finale of this journey: after this day, we would all drift apart and head for our own destinations instead of a united one. This was the last moment that we work for a common goal and thus such a milestone deserves a chance to be here, enjoying all the spotlight.<br>This life journey has been a long way: we have come so far and done so much that we go from greet to graduation, from sobs to smiles. All these cherishable memories have converted into the fertilisers that make us exuberant. We are no longer the buds which are shy to shine but the flowers which dare to blossom; we are no longer the caterpillars that crawl on the ground with no hope but the butterflies that dance in the wildest dreams. Now we are about to turn over a new chapter in our lives and there are much more episodes ahead of us. Fascinating as the new chapters may be, this story will forever be the best memory in my life.<br><br>
You are graduating from F6 soon, and as the publication secretary of the Student Union of your school, you are writing a yearbook entry to be published to all schoolmates.
Write on:

<br>One of the most memorable experience you have encountered among the six years of your secondary school life, and
<br>Your dream, which may be about your career, who you would like to become, or how you would like to change the world.

<br>My motivational booster – Miss Josephine!<br>Glancing at the series of class photos 6C took truly dragged me down the memory lane of reminiscent. All the genuine emotions started pouring out, I simply cannot comprehend them all. From an innocent sophomore to a mature highschooler, I can still clearly recall each and every snippet of the journey. Looking back, I was this<br>
shy and introverted ‘toddler’ when I first stepped foot into the campus. All the fear and doubts shoved me right in the face that secondary school is a process of the transformation of ‘little, ugly ducklings’. I thought: Attaining admission to such a prestigious school equals to skyrocketing expectations. Do I even deserve to be here?<br>Having my mouth as well as my vocal cord tightly sealed, I decided to isolate myself and planned on teetering my way through the six years. Just when I thought it was the end of the day, my class teacher, Miss Josephine, reached out to me and offered heartfelt words of encouragement which motivated me to step out of the boundaries and constraints that I have originally established for myself. Up till this day, her words are still remarkably indoctrinated in my heart, she said, “It’s okay. It takes time to adapt to unfamiliar faces and to immerse yourself in an unprecedented ambience. A myriad of opportunities are here awaiting, it is up to you whether you are willing and ready to grasp them all. Now take a deep breath and reach out to your neighbour!”<br>This is how I got to know my first acquaintance here and how I learnt to overcome my inner fears. I have never gotten the opportunity to express my gratitude to Miss Josephine, what seemed to be so minuscule and minimal actually means the world to us students! Thank you for demonstrating what courage is and teaching me a lifelong lesson!<br>My white coat aspiration<br>Hardly can I count the number of times I have envisioned myself standing on stage at the White Coat Inauguration Ceremony, taking an oath to serve the populace in front of my beloved ones. Unlike many who may have life beyond high school all mapped out, all I know is I have always wanted to become a doctor upon graduation. Being a doctor is such a worthwhile and purposeful occupation. Becoming a physician equals to taking away pain and sufferings of others. Alongside providing medications and healthcare treatments, a physician also acts as a fountain of exuberance. I want to provide both patients and their families hope and anticipation, something that they can look forward to. Amidst gloomiest days, a doctor will be bringing a ray of sunshine to the dreary days.<br>I would also like to initiate and establish a charitable foundation which aims at providing free of charge medical services to patients with financial hardships and struggling to afford the extortionate amount of treatment expenses. Irrespective of financial status and background, everyone deserve equal treatment. With a heart to serve, I will strike for egalitarianism and equity among all. The foundation will also be collaborating with ‘Doctors without borders’ targeting paediatric patients from 3rd world countries including but are not limited to Central African Republic, Niger, and South Sudan.<br>“It takes courage, a little magic, and a wild soul to follow your dreams”, a saying well said from sagacious ideologists. We can never predict nor foresee the future, but all we can do is to constantly remind ourselves of the rationale behind the establishment of our goal and approach it step-by-step, little-by-little. Hustle, grind, strive, whatever it takes, we will get there eventually and morph into our ideal selves while reaching for your own desired pinnacle. Schoolmates, don’t hesitate to dream wild and become who you have always aspired to be!]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/graduation-writing-(school-life).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Graduation writing (School Life).md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[HKDSE 2012 Q9 - Ways to relieve stress]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
Your school magazine is going to include a special feature on mental health. Recently, one of your friends was suffering from depression. Write an article for the school magazine about your friend’s depression and how he/she overcame it. Give advice to others on how to help fight depression.
<br>Ways to confront stress directly!<br>Plagued by the insurmountable stress and can’t find a way out? This is probably the daily life of nowadays teenagers. If you are also one of those who have no idea about how to get rid of your pressure, please stay tuned and read on!<br>The very first step you should take to get rid of stress is to identify its sources. How can you remove the stressors if you can’t even recognise their roots? Therefore, next time when you feel stressed, instead of writing it off as temporary, try to keep track of it. Have no clue how to begin? A stress journal will certainly help. By means of keeping a daily log of every stressful moment, you can see patterns and common theme in the stressors. As such, devising a strategy to deal with the stress is now possible, so do be reminded to give it a shot!<br>After identifying the stressors, it is time to take concrete actions, and so the 3As – “avoid, adapt and accept” may work wonders! I believe that after you analyse your own stress journal, most of you will realise that it is your unnecessary worries that give rise to such anxiety. So why don’t you dwell less on your own problems? Our brains have limited capacity for processing information. The more we have on our plate, the more likely we are overwhelmed by the workload, and the more stressed we will feel! So, do drop the tasks that don’t really matter to the bottom of your to-do list. You’ll be relieved without these burdens!<br>If stress is unavoidable, then you should consider adapting to it! With the ultimate goal to strive for perfections, it is common for us to feel pressurised. (I bet your stress journal can tell as well!) Yet, to achieve perfections is a mission impossible! After all, we are no saints but only human beings who are doomed to make mistakes! Therefore, what you should do is to accept, if not embrace your own imperfections, and be less harsh on yourself! Equally important is to set reasonable standards for yourself and learn not to be guilty of ‘being mediocre’.<br>But what should we do if we can’t adapt to it? Here comes another handy piece of advice: you have to learn to accept your failure. Lots of things in life are beyond our control, be they others’ perceptions of ourselves or the future events that are unpredictable to us. Trying to have control over the uncontrollable is such a silly behaviour! Nobody in his right mind should have his energy drained over the unpredictable, and neither should you. So just focus on the parts you can control and stay optimistic! They are the best response you can come up with. Even if, lamentably, you’re confronted with challenges, view them as opportunities for personal growth as opposed to another round of ordeal: being an optimist occasionally won’t bite!<br>Life is never a smooth sailing – stress must be there awaiting for us no matter what stage we’re in. Sooner or later, you have to accept its existence and learn to live with it. It’s our choice to make it a boon or a bane. It’s time we all grapple each stressful moment to learn.]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/hkdse-2012-q9-ways-to-relieve-stress.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/HKDSE 2012 Q9 - Ways to relieve stress.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[HKDSE 2013 Q7 - Asian singers and movie stars]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
Learning English through Popular Culture<br>
Asian singers and movie stars are gaining popularity all over the world and are no longer appealing only to Asian audiences. Write an article for your school newspaper explaining why Asian stars are gaining popularity in Western countries. Give a title to your article.
<br>Asian Pop Culture: Drivers Behind Asian Stars’ Irresistible Appeal to Westerners<br>The showbiz-industry, in both the fields of music and film, was once dominated by the west, with all those Hollywood movies breaking box-office record and songs sung by Western bands like One Direction sweeping across the streets like a strain of flu. It is not until recently that the tide has vanished into thin air – Asian movie stars and singers are gaining traction and an unprecedented popularity among western audience, taking over the showbiz-industry from the hands of western stars. Let’s delve deep into the drivers behind the rise of Asian stars, and what contributes to their increasing influence in the world.<br>First and foremost, the rising popularity of Asian stars has much to do with the refreshing nature of the works they produced. Gone are the days when Western audience were obsessed with / were attracted to / were drawn to the same genres of songs and films produced by singers or artists from their own countries. With the influx of a deluge of sorrowful ballad loved songs sung by singers like Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran, Westerners have been so fed up with these repetitive love songs that that begin to crave for songs that are rather different and novel. This has ultimately given rise to PSY’s ‘Gangnam Style’, causing a stir all over the globe. Since then, people start to have a craze for K-pop – many teens are no stranger to the dance moves of Blackpink’s Flowers and BTS’ Boy with Luv. As we can see, it is no longer the emotional love songs that capture listeners’ ears. Instead, it is the upbeat nature, together with the pulsating beats and cheesy dance that help Asian singers like PSY to win over listeners’ heart, as these elements are deemed as rather refreshing, energetic and youthful, but not as conventional as most songs produced in the western music industry.<br>Standing alongside the refreshing nature of the works produced by Asian artists, integral to their irresistible appeal to westerners is also these singers’ and stars’ stellar performance in their works. Many Asian stars, as well as singers are so versatile and talented in their field that audience from Western countries gradually discover these stars as underrated gems. One vivid example is undoubtedly Michelle Yeoh, our Oscar Best Actress Academy Award Winner whose exceptional performance in the movie ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’ win over worldwide recognition and acclaim from audience all over the world. There is no shortage of such talented artists in the music field, of course. BTS, the Korean boy band whose songs have accumulated billions of views on YouTube, has garnered an immense fanbase not only in Asian countries but also in Western countries like the US and Canada, for their members’ versatility of adapting at singing, dancing and rapping in tandem. Equally talented is another band Blackpink, whose dancing skills are so mind-blowing that many international reality shows even invite them to be judges for the new blood dancers. These artists’ stellar performance has eventually led them to all-time high popularity, helping them break into the western market.<br>Last but not least, globalization also plays an indispensable role in paving the way for the escalating fame of Asian artists. It is of paramount importance that Asian artists must have their innovative works and talents to capture the heart of western viewers, but this can never be done without the channel for them to have their songs and films exposed to foreign audience. This sparks volume about the importance of globalization. The emergence of a variety of streaming platforms under globalization open a gateway for viewers and audience to explore not only songs and films produced from their own countries, but also those from Asian countries. Access are widely opened – viewers can simply click a button on Netflix and start binge watching ‘Crash Landing On You’ or ‘Goblin’, while music lovers can have a taste of ‘Lemon’, sung by Japanese singer Kenshi Yonezu on Spotify. Geographical barriers are broken in the era of globalization, enabling westerners to have a peak into their rather unfamiliar Asian Pop Cultural, providing them a channel to discover these underrated gems in the meantime.<br>As an Asian, it is indeed delightful for me to witness our singers and stars gaining fame in western countries as what they deserve. Yet, it is never a battle between the East and West when it comes to the dominance in showbiz-industry, it ought to be more delightful for us to welcome the advent of an entertainment industry which showcases inclusiveness towards artists, which embraces differences among artists of different races, and provides equal opportunities for all.]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/hkdse-2013-q7-asian-singers-and-movie-stars.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/HKDSE 2013 Q7 - Asian singers and movie stars.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sample 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Learning English through Debating<br>
It has recently been reported that some parents in Asian countries are installing apps on their children’s mobile phones that monitor their activities to ensure that they use these devices responsibly.
Write a letter to the Young Post stating whether you agree with these parents’ actions or not. Justify your position with three reasons.
<br><br>Dear Editor,<br>
<br>Introduction

<br>Reason of writing:<br>
I am writing to express my opinion about some parents’ installation of monitoring apps on their children’s mobile phones.
<br>Background:<br>
“Tiger moms”, “wolf dads”, “helicopter parents” – to name but just a few – these are all terms describing Asian parents who make every endeavour to monitor or control the behaviour of their children. Recently, it has been reported that some parents in Asian countries are installing apps on their children’s mobile phones that monitor their activities to ensure their responsible use of these devices. While some deem it reasonable and sensible, some see it unreasonable and absurd.
<br>State your stance clearly:<br>
After meticulous consideration, it is my conviction that such an act is by no means beneficial to the children and the family.


<br>Children’s development of self-discipline

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
To commence with, the installation of monitoring apps will hamper children’s development of self-discipline.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Living in this technological era, it is public knowledge that self-discipline is of crucial significance for there are much more temptations in society than before. Knowing how to distinguish between right and wrong is thereby indispensable, especially for easily swayed young minds. Admittedly, through installing the apps and paying heed to every act of teens on their electronic gadgets can parents produce a deterrent effect in the short term, protecting them from falling victim to online frauds or having minds perverted by inappropriate content. Yet, such effects are by no means sustainable. Youngsters behave themselves only to avoid punishment from parents, rather than understanding the importance of using devices responsibly.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
Consequently, many of them will fail to avoid temptations in real life, where parents can no longer monitor them.


<br>Relationship between parents and children

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
Apart from impeding children’s development of self-discipline, under no circumstances should we overlook the negative impact of installing monitoring apps poses to the relationship between parents and children.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Due to long working hours, many parents lack time to communicate with their children, thus having distant relationship with the latter. Further to this, under the influence of traditional Chinese parenting as well as the grade-fixated education system in Asian countries, many parents tend to lay emphasis on children’s academic achievement rather than expressing their love and care when they are with their children after work. As a result, misunderstanding and conflicts crop up more easily. In light of this, the act of installing apps to monitor children’s use of electronic devices will exacerbate the current problems. Teenagers, who already hardly feel the love of their parents, will deem such an act a lack of trust. They may then be more unwilling to open up to their parents, or even intentionally act against their parents’ will to express their discontent, doing irreparable harm to their relationship with parents.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
Under this line of thinking, isn’t it farcical to install monitoring apps given it may wreak havoc on the most precious parent-child relationship?


<br>Rebuttal

<br>State other’s stance:<br>
Supporters of the act may counter my stance, holding the view that it can ensure children use their phones properly, lowering their chance of being submerged in the virtual world and thus have better time management.
<br>Politely address the other’s stance + Point of rebuttal:<br>
While this argument is reasonable at first glance, it is in fact fundamentally flawed when closely examined. Undeniably, such an act can prevent children from getting addicted to the use of mobile phones in the beginning. However, does it necessarily mean that children will allocate their time to studies or other meaningful use? With children’s immature mind, they may be obsessed with playing online games and browsing the Internet on computers; With children’s immature mind, they may still be hooked on watching television programmes; With children’s immature mind, they may be vulnerable to the distractions and temptations in the real world.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
In other words, it is simply difficult, if not impossible, to control teenagers’ responsible use of time.


<br>Conclusion

<br>Restate your stance + Summary:<br>
After the aforementioned analysis, it is manifest that the parents’ installation of monitoring apps on their children’s phones is in no way reasonable. We have to understand that this will deter children from developing self-discipline and shatter the mutual trust between parents and children while having minimal impact on controlling children’s use of time.
<br>End in high spirits (What Asian parents should do):<br>
Thus, it is earnestly hoped that Asian parents can stop this futile act in no time. After all, parental education is about love and care, rather than rules and supervision.


<br>Yours faithfully,<br>

 <br>
Learning English through Debating<br>
As captain of the debate team you have been asked to write a debate speech. The task is to argue that “Watching TV Makes Us Smarter”.
In your speech you should include three reasons to support the statement. Write your speech.
<br><br>Adjudicators, the opponent team, ladies and gentlemen,<br>
<br>Introduction

<br>Describe the situation and -ve stance:<br>
Good morning. Today’s motion is “Watching TV Makes Us Smarter”. Speaking of watching TV, I believe some of you may have this picture in your mind – a lazy and obese guy lying on a sofa, gobbling potato chips and gluing his eyes to the flashy screen of a television set in a dark room.
<br>State your stance clearly:<br>
Although over-indulgence in the world of television can deal a great blow to our lives, our team strongly believe that there are numerous benefits of watching television that can make us smarter.


<br>Knowledge of the world

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
First and foremost, watching television can widen our horizons and act as a platform for us to take a glance at the world beyond our reach.
<br>Background:<br>
Especially for teenagers nowadays, who confine themselves inside the curriculum to excel in the exams under this grade-fixated education system, television programmes can be a window for them to know more about the real world and acquire knowledge that is beyond the scope of their studies.
<br>Explain the idea clearly + Point of conclusion:<br>
For example, documentaries like “A Man in the Wild”, “A Walk in Modern China” and “The European Heights” feature landscapes of various continents and unveil the authentic lives of natives and locals in different territories beyond our footsteps. Can you learn these from study and work? Probably not. Therefore, apart from enjoying leisure and entertainment from TV shows, we can also obtain insight of other aspects of life and widen our horizons. These help us get a glimpse of the outside world and enrich our knowledge and understanding of the world, making us smarter instead of being bookworms that only memorize the study materials for our exams.


<br>Understanding of social issues

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
In addition to broadening our horizons, watching TV can enhance our understanding of social issues, developing critical thinking skills in the course of scrutinizing controversies through TV programmes.
<br>Background:<br>
Nowadays, thanks to the advancement of information technology, we can keep abreast of the latest news through websites like Apple Daily, Mingpao, Time Magazine and Facebook. However, as we glance through the brief descriptions of news headlines and we scroll down the page on our dearest iPhones, do we truly understand the topic in detail? Obviously not.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
In contrast, news reports on TV, or documentaries like “The Sunday Profile” offer an in-depth analysis of social issues, be it the widening wealth gap in Hong Kong, the “One Belt One Road Initiative” of China or the refugee crisis in Europe. In the shows, TV reporters interview political experts and stakeholders of the issue to discuss the controversial social problems. Through watching these TV programmes, we can develop our sense to think from multiple perspectives and criticize the maladministration of the government. Convenient as it is, the critical skills can hardly be cultivated by a cursory look on the electronic gadget on our palms.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
In this sense, watching TV is advantageous to honing our critical thinking, enabling us to develop a deeper understanding of our society, and of course, making us smarter.


<br>Enhance English proficiency

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
Last but not least, watching TV can enhance our English proficiency, which is vitally important in interpersonal communication.
<br>Background:<br>
In Hong Kong, which is dubbed as a “cultural melting pot”, English is indispensable in our daily life, like workplace communication and socialization with foreigners.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Television, which offers English channels, helps us beef up our English listening and speaking skills. Watching financial news every day, for example, can enhance our English vocabulary of various issues, ranging from the governance of enterprises to the economic development in different countries. Watching American soap dramas on Pearl and HMC can also enrich our English vocabulary as we can learn the slangs and words used by foreigners in their scripts. As a consequence, we can communicate effectively with foreigners.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
In this sense, watching TV shows can develop our language ability, which is beneficial to us and makes us smarter.


<br>Rebuttal

<br>State other’s stance:<br>
The opponent may counter my stance, contending that indulging in soap dramas that teach us nothing but romance and family conflicts is not beneficial and makes us ignorant, since we may become obsessed with the virtual world in the TV series and forget about our real lives.
<br>Point of rebuttal:<br>
However, the argument is in fact flawed.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Obviously, over-indulgence in TV can pose serious drawbacks to our well-being and mindset. However, if we utilize the television channels properly, choosing the educational programmes and channels to watch, TV in reality can make us smarter. In addition, with the prevalence of discussion of television programmes on various online forums, like Hkdiscuss and Lihkg, we can understand more about the benefits and drawbacks of a programme and make an appropriate choice. It is also worth noting that some detective story series such as Sherlock Holmes and Kindaichi Case Files are beneficial, stimulating our creative and logical thinking.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
Under this link of thinking, watching TV can make us smarter as long as we exercise self-restraint and choose the appropriate programmes.


<br>Conclusion

<br>Summary:<br>
In conclusion, TV programmes can broaden our horizons by allowing us to get a glimpse of the outside world, hone our critical thinking skills by analysing social issues and enhance our English proficiency.
<br>Restate your stance:<br>
It is our firm belief that watching TV makes us smarter, and today’s motion must stand. Thank you.

Unlike swimmers or basketball players, dancers are not traditionally thought of as athletes. As a member of your school’s dance team you have been asked to write an article for your school magazine. Use the title and headings below to support the idea of dancers as athletes.

<br>Dancers Are Athletes<br><br>
<br>Introduction

<br>Background:<br>
What comes up in your mind when you are asked to give examples of athletes? Swimmers, basketball players, 100 m sprint runners ... You name it. Sadly, the general public seldom regard dancers as a kind of athletes due to the existence of some stereotypes.
<br>State your stance clearly:<br>
In fact, dancers are real athletes, and like others, they need to be skillful and disciplined enough in order to excel in the world of dancing.


<br>Physical Strengths and Skills

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
We need to bear in mind that physical strengths and skills are the prerequisites for phenomenal success in both ordinary athletic sports and dancing.
<br>Background:<br>
Athletic sports are often seen as some kinds of sports requiring high physical strengths and are skill-oriented, like gymnastics, in which body balance and the skills to achieve elegant movements are of paramount of significance; and 1500m run, which requires strong muscles and an excellent cardiovascular system.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Similarly, a dancer has to fulfill similar requirements. For instance, hip-hop dancers are encouraged to have sharp and rapid movements that require the use of strong muscle movements and the frequent steps in hip hop dance also demand the dancers to have a trained respiratory system which can support strenuous movements and endure for a long period of time. This proves dancing actually needs dancers to have a certain level of physical strength, like other athletic sports. In terms of the skills involved, I believe dancing has far more techniques that need to be developed by the dancers themselves than those who are traditionally regarded as athletes. Dancing techniques, ranging from movements and steps to teamwork and choreography, should be figured out by the dancers step by step before they become professional dancers.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
It is evident that dancers are just like the athletes on the stage of the Olympics in which they have to spare no effort in developing their own sets of skills.


<br>Self-discipline &amp; Training

<br>Different stances:<br>
Some argue that dancers are not receiving as much training as the athletes on tracks, in the basketball courts or even on the ice-skating rings.
<br>Point of rebuttal:<br>
It is high time for dancers to defend themselves against the skeptical naysayers who doubt whether dancers are athletes.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
We can often see that dancers shine on the stage of the town hall, presenting their brilliant dances to the audience, and all these can be attributed to their ceaseless training behind the scene. Like the other athletes, it is almost compulsory for every dancer to receive a series of incessant training before they head onto the stage. You also have to remember they are reprimanded by their instructors almost on a daily basis like the athletes on track, just to hone everything to perfection. We often hear the stories of athletes suffering great emotional meltdown during their training, so do the dancers! It is apparent that the endurance of dancers will be no weaker than those who have been recognized as athletes. Besides, we can all realize that self-discipline is indispensable for all athletes. As a dancer in the school’s dance team, I truly understand that self-discipline is also crucial in the road of mastering dancing, and this is the perfect evidence that dancers are also athletes. No matter it is a professional dancer like Liu Man Ting, who aces in ballet, Yanki Din who aces in Jazz, and hip hop, or an amateur dancer like me, they have to arrange packed schedules for themselves for the sake of grabbing more chances for practising and performing in flawless shows.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
Being as self-disciplined and motivated as other athletes, they should be recognized true athletes.


<br>Conclusion

<br>Summary + Restate your stance:<br>
To sum up, dancers are not thought of as athletes merely due to the public misunderstanding and stereotypes. Nevertheless, I do believe dancers are true athletes, as they have worked their butts off to transform themselves into skillful and persistent warriors like the other athletes do.

Learning English through Workplace Communication<br>
It has recently been claimed that in the workplace many Hong Kong fresh university graduates are less hard-working and less willing to face challenges compared to those in the past You strongly disagree with this opinion. Write a letter to the editor of the Hong Kong Daily disagreeing with this opinion. Support your view with three reasons and/or examples.
<br>Dear Editor,<br><br>
<br>Introduction

<br>Reason for writing:<br>
I am writing in response to the letter entitled “Fresh university graduates lack the willingness to work hard and overcome challenges” dated 7 April 2017.
<br>State your stance directly:<br>
As a young entrepreneur, I am strongly against such a claim due to the following seasons.


<br>They are willing to explore new business opportunities in society.

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
In fact, fresh university graduates in Hong Kong are willing to explore new business opportunities in society, which reveals that they are not afraid of challenges.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
The 21st century is a century of technological advancement and the Internet has provided the young generation with a flood of new business opportunities. Not afraid of possible failures, a lot of new university graduates in our city actually set up their own business online, ranging from online shops to online mass media. One glaring example of this new type of business is 9GAG, which is a Facebook page posting memes and jokes, and has become viral not only in Hong Kong but also in foreign countries. Their willingness to develop this brand-new type of business illustrates the fact that they are willing to face challenges, not to mention the hard work they have devoted to maintaining the operation of their own business and achieving phenomenal success.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
How would it be reasonable to call the fresh university graduates in Hong Kong “lazy” and “easily defeated by challenges” given the phenomenon mentioned above, which is becoming more common among the young generation?


<br>They spend time on social networking sites during their work hours.

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
Yet, some employers may complain that their new employees are spending their precious time on social networking sites instead of their work during their working hours.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
It must be acknowledged that some the fresh university graduates are not paying full attention to their work, but the work culture in Hong Kong, instead of the young generation, is to be blamed. In myriads of foreign companies, employers are trying to incorporate entertainment into work, with Google being one of the most notable companies. My own company has already adopted similar approaches, such as installing television sets in the office, and I have never complained that my employees are not industrious enough. Unfortunately, in most of the companies in Hong Kong, employees are still required to sit front of the computer and work ceaselessly, which is boring especially for the young generation who ranks creativity and novel ideas on the top of their priority lists. Yet, such a problem can actually be tackled by the above-mentioned approach. With more entertainment in the work culture, I strongly believe that young employees will find more incentives to work and become more hardworking.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
Therefore, it can be seen that the monotonous and dreary work culture in Hong Kong is the culprit of the problems and dissatisfaction experienced by the senior staff, and the fresh university graduates should not be blamed for it.


<br>They quit their jobs easily.

<br>State other’s stance:<br>
Some people in the workplace may also claim that fresh university graduates in Hong Kong quit their jobs easily.
<br>Politely address the other’s stance + Point of rebuttal:<br>
At first glance, this may indicate that they are easily defeated by challenges, but this actually reveals that a more participative leadership is the ideal choice for leading the new employees.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Recently, there has been a piece of news about an employee of the 90s quitting his job within a few days as his employer scolded him, which has stirred a lot of controversy in our society. Some of the senior staff claim that the fresh university graduates are not willing to admit their own mistakes and lack the ability to overcome obstacles in the workplace. These people, however, overlook the fact that the young generation is seeking acceptance as equals from the other generations. In my own company, the employees and I have a weekly gathering during lunch, in which they can express views on their work and exchange ideas with one another. Through this type of leadership will the employees have an impression that they are treated equally and given valuable advice, instead of orders for their work. This can provide them with a sense of achievement when they overcome an obstacle as they have more decision-making power and a sense of empowerment.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
From my personal experience, I believe that with an appropriate leadership style, the fresh university graduates actually have a strong willingness to face challenges.


<br>Conclusion

<br>Summary:<br>
As a young entrepreneur, I deeply understand what strengths the young generation is equipped with and what they are seeking.
<br>End in high spirits (What others employees should do):<br>
It is hoped that other employees in the city can try to communicate more with their fresh employees, trusting the future pillars of our society.

<br>Introduction

<br>Reason for writing:<br>
I am writing in response to the recent claim of myriads of Hong Kong fresh university graduates being less hardworking and willing to face challenges compared with their counterparts in the past.
<br>State your stance clearly:<br>
It goes without saying that the socioeconomic situation of Hong Kong has changed drastically over the past few decades and the university graduates nowadays suffer tremendously with the intensifying competition in society. As far as I am concerned, the accusations against the graduates are groundless and they actually work tirelessly and relentlessly to overcome the thorny challenges every day.


<br>They are bold enough to step out of the comfort zone.

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
To commence with, there is ample evidence that the university graduates in this era are willing to face challenges.
<br>Background:<br>
Back in the old days, university graduates were rare and they were often offered the opportunities to work as management personnel in some top-notch enterprises locally and internationally, for example the human resource managers of HSBC or analysts of JP Morgan. As these jobs were so lucrative, they clung on to their jobs and dared not challenge themselves by establishing their own businesses.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Nowadays, the number of university graduates has been skyrocketing, giving rise to keen competition in the job market. Some of those graduates who lose this hostile battle can only earn their living through the establishment of their own businesses. Read local newspapers and you will discover their novel ideas, say food trucks, production of handicrafts and operation of online selling platforms on ebay, Carousell and Taobao. For those who are less innovative, they have accepted employment offers from mainland China, where they have to face unfairness and discrimination.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
In the face of the cutthroat competition in the labour market, many university graduates are bold enough to step out of their comfort zone, overcoming challenges in their own businesses and pursuing new opportunities in mainland China.


<br>They are eager to climb up the social ladder.

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
Regarding the claim that university graduates are less hardworking, I believe the critics have underestimated the graduates’ determination and persistence in changing their own destiny.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Due to the intense competition from local counterparts and influx of overseas talents caused by globalization, the difficulty of recruitment is plummeting. Hoping to maintain their competitiveness, many fresh university graduates further their studies for master or even doctoral degrees. As they have entered the workforce, they have no alternative but to complete their studies on a part-time basis. Obviously, this mode of studying often generate unbearable exhaustion and excruciating stress as they are bombarded by their superiors with immense workload at the same time. Take my cousin as an example. Pursuing the Doctor of Philosophy degree in Science, he has to work around the clock – arriving at his office before 9, hurrying to the University of Hong Kong at around 7 and working on his assignments and projects until midnight.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
This hectic lifestyle suggests that those university graduates who are eager to climb up the social ladder are willing to work industriously.


<br>In reality, they are so hardworking that they have applied for several jobs.

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
Furthermore, some fresh undergraduates are so hardworking that they have applied for several part-time jobs in addition to their full-time employment.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Not only are these fresh graduates motivated to maintain their competitiveness, it is also their wish to improve their families’ quality of living by earning some extra money. The millennials do not have a smooth pathway of employment like their predecessors. Instead, most of the experience hardship when looking for job openings and end up earning salary which is not self-sustainable, let alone purchasing their own apartments and establishing their own families. Finding it difficult to make ends meet, many fresh graduates apply for all sorts of part-time jobs, such as being private tutors and cashiers as well as translating document. In exchange for a brighter future, they sacrifice their work-life balance and spare time which could have been spent on developing friendship and entertaining themselves.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
How can we say that the fresh university graduates nowadays are not hardworking?


<br>Conclusion

<br>Summary:<br>
All in all, not only does such a claim show how ignorant some critics are, it also reveals how miserable the life of some university graduates is.
<br>End in high spirits (What others employees should do):<br>
To provide them with work-life balance and change their destiny, collaborative effort from the government and employers is definitely required.

Learning English through Workplace Communication<br>
The Hong Kong Daily Press invites readers to express their views on the following topic: Do social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter encourage or stifle public debate? When first created, the social media was thought to be a place where rational debate and logic would thrive. However, as time has shown, this is not always the case.

<br>Write an argumentative essay.
<br>Choose one side of the argument and state your position, giving reasons and evidence to support your view.

Include a title for your essay.
<br>Social Media – the cradle for public debates<br><br>
<br>Introduction

<br>Background:<br>
Even if we are not the keen followers of social trends, it is unlikely we will miss out the rising trend of online public debate. Scrolling through the pages of YouTube and Facebook, we are bound to discover that there is no dearth of public debate on a variety of topics. The advancement in social media has irrefutably incentivized discussion about social affairs. Some may understandably scratch their heads: aren’t these kinds of debate too irrational? Aren’t social media platforms stifling public debate due to excessively high degree of freedom of expression?
<br>State your stance clearly:<br>
Indeed, these are no more than misunderstanding of social media platforms. Below are the reasons why social media encourages online discussion.


<br>Social media has become the fertile ground of public debate.

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
While the debates on social media platforms seem to be fierce and deleterious, there are actually many benefits hidden from plain sight, which negate the so-called downsides. Firstly, it is worth noting that the willingness of expressing opinion in the virtual world coincides with the blossoming of social media.
<br>Explain the barriers of face-to-face communication:<br>
Chatting face-to-face, many people are reluctant to speak out for fear that they may be criticized, offend others and ultimately damage interpersonal relationships.
<br>Explain the benefits of social media:<br>
In contrast, with only a few tabs on the screen, netizens can already express their view on various social issues. Undoubtedly, social media has played a significant role in fuelling the trend of public debate. Owing to the anonymous nature of online platforms, people can voice their opinion without constraints and fear, wholeheartedly telling others their thoughts. Without the supervision by teachers, students can criticize the ossified education system on the Internet; without the watchful eyes by their parents, teenagers can vent their dissatisfaction with helicopter parenting; without being lambasted by colleagues of contrasting political view, everyone can fearlessly express their exasperation with the incompetence of the government.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
Motivating people to voice their opinion, social media has become the fertile ground of public debate.


<br>Social media has offered a wider variety of communication tools.

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
Apart from emboldening netizens to express their view, the fact that they can utilize a wide variety of communication tools has also encouraged people to participate in public debate.
<br>Background:<br>
Gone are the days when we could only initiate a debate solely through words, which were repetitive and tedious. Thanks to technological advancement, we can type words, take snapshots and even record videos to express our view of various issues.
<br>Explain the point clearly:<br>
Apparently, the availability of photos and videos has added spice and spark to the virtual world, motivating more young people to engage in online discussion. More importantly, through posting photos and videos can netizens provide more compelling evidence and lay a solid foundation for online debate. For example, when an online user vents his or her frustration with a passenger’s reluctance to vacate a seat for a pregnant woman on an MTR train or a deluxe restaurant’s deplorably atrocious customer services merely through words, most people would deem this a make-up story and malicious condemnation. However, if snapshots and videos are provided, most netizens will be convinced and opt to support that online user’s arguments.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
As we can see, not only can the kaleidoscope of communicative tools available on social media appeal to netizens, but also strengthen the persuasive power of online debate.


<br>Social media discussion can encourage public debate by enhancing its quality.

<br>Different stances:<br>
Blinded by their bias against social media platforms, some conservatives hold the belief that social media stifles public debate by making discussion excessively ferocious and irrational.
<br>Point of rebuttal:<br>
Nevertheless, we should recognize the fact that the capacity of the virtual world enables millions of netizens to comment on the same issue, thereby raising the objectiveness of public debate.
<br>Explain the idea clearly:<br>
Differing from a face-to-face debate which only allows a limited number of participants, social media discussion can be engaged in by netizens from all walks of life and all over the globe. Having a discussion commenced, like Brexit, the Sino-US trade war and the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, online users of different careers, ages and nationalities could have a say. With people thinking from different perspectives by reading and responding to different comments, there is no doubt the debate will be more comprehensive and its quality will be enhanced. While some staunch opponents distance themselves from social media, demonizing it as a destroyer of logical debate, we should bear in mind that once there are unreasonably radical comments on the social media platforms, they will be instantly challenged by other sensible netizens, some of whom are erudite professionals like lawyers, scholars and political analysts.
<br>Conclusion:<br>
With this in mind, it can be clearly seen that the participation in social media discussion from netizens all over the globe can encourage public debate through enhancing its quality and making it more objective.


<br>Conclusion

<br>Summary:<br>
In essence, social media platforms are the perfect cradle encouraging public debate. Their unique features – allowing users to be anonymous, having a wide variety of communicative tools and encouraging a surging number of global participants have all been advantageous to the discussion of social affairs.
<br>End in high spirits (What others employees should do):<br>
It is earnestly hoped that everyone will recognize the benefits of social media in galvanizing public discussion, which will ultimately enhance governance and the well-being of mankind.

 <br>
You work for Planet Smart, a company that sells eco-friendly products. Your company wants to set up a pop-up shop inside a shopping centre for 3 months to promote your products to new customers.<br>
Complete the application form below.
Company Name:<br>
Products:<br>
Events:
<br>Founded in 2020, we are a local company that strives to promote environmental conservation through selling eco-friendly products such as clothes and bags. Our founder Chris Wong was deeply concerned about the waste disposal and the ensuing land pollution problem in Hong Kong. Inspired by UK-based company ConnectEarth, Chris decided to bring the idea of producing biodegradable clothing to Hong Kong. Our company’s mission is to raise the public’s awareness of environment protection. We hope to change consumers’ behaviour through three Es, namely education, empowerment and execution. We have also strived to maintain an online presence by promoting our latest products and sharing our eco-friendly products features as well as our production line on social media<br>Our best-selling product is undoubtedly the “BioJean” – our latest edition of biodegradable jeans. We have noticed that a lot of jeans in the market are environmentally unfriendly in many ways, from production to consumption to disposal throughout the entire life cycle of the product. For instance, a lot of waste water is produced in the colouration procedures of the jeans. What makes the situation worse is that these jeans are commonly not made durable given the continuous demand for new designs. In particular, many teenagers hopped on the bandwagon and embraced the trend of fast fashion, which means that users may need to replace jeans with new one frequently. These jeans eventually end up in landfills. Since they are non-biodegradable, they will only aggravate the already-severe land pollution problems. Through modifying the denim’s chemical structures in the jeans, together with the addition of fungal components, the jeans can be more easily degraded by bacteria in soil. An additional benefit that came to our surprise during testing phase is that these materials together can make the product more durable, stretchable and less prone to damage. Moreover, we have strict guidelines on colouration and waste disposal during our production that we adhere to, such as the use of harmless dyes and filtering any residues in a multi-layer system before disposal into areas permitted by the government. We are delighted to have received positive responses from our customers, claiming that the jeans are more durable than other jeans and the texture even has an edge over traditional jeans.<br>To echo with our favourite product – BioJean, we plan to hold jean sewing workshops in our store where participants have the chance to feel the texture of our jeans and understand more about the rationale and production process behind our biodegradable jeans. Each participant will be given a piece of jean cloth and will follow the instructions of the tutors to complete the sewing tutorial. In the meantime, we will demonstrate how sewing can be achieved more easily with our modified denim in our jeans. Afterwards, our participants will have to take part in an online quiz with questions related to our products and contributions to the environment. 80% or above accuracy will grant participants a 30% off discount on immediately-purchased products. Through this event, we hope to achieve the aims of educating the public on eco-friendly products, empowering them to be confident about making lifestyle changes and eventually executing their plans. We are confident that this event will capture window-shoppers’ attention and we anticipate a successful opening in the shopping mall.<br>

 <br>
Learning English through Debating<br>
The following topic was discussed at a debate workshop:
Some employers use cameras and computer software to monitor what employees are doing in the workplace. How do you think this affects productivity and job sanctification?
Write an essay about the pros and cons of monitoring employees in the workplace.
<br>Monitoring Employees——Is It a Wise Move?<br>Whether to always keep an eye on employees’ behaviours in the workplace or to allow them to have more freedom has always been highly debated among employers. Different firms implement diverse approaches for employee management, some turn out to be a way to success while others have brought irreversible consequences. It would be a wise thing to do that we scrutinize the approach in question before adopting it — should we monitor employees?<br>There are, indeed, some benefits of doing so. Topping the list of monitoring staff would be increased productivity. It is crystal clear that one’s productivity solely hinges on one’s self-discipline. Nonetheless, this fundamental ability varies as different individuals’ personalities, characteristics or even values are diverse. Companies simply have no control over whether an employee has self-discipline. This is when monitoring helps. It is not uncommon for some employees to deal with their private matters during working hours in the workplace, namely browsing social media platforms or going for a chat with colleagues. However, if computer software is installed on employees’ devices, access to those websites would be denied automatically, leaving employees no other options but to work. The camera works as a reminder to employees that all their behaviours are being tracked during working hours, so they would refrain from having excessive and unnecessary chats with colleagues. Therefore, it is conceivable that monitoring employees would boost productivity.<br>Another prominent but often overlooked benefit of monitoring is that it ensures the safety of both employees and the firm. Ridiculous as it may seem, a workplace without surveillance cameras, is the best location for unlawful activities to take place. According to the Annual Workplace Crimes Report from the Police Department of Hong Kong, 89% of workplace crimes, like stealing personal property, took place within the workplace without cameras. When there is the possibility for employees’ personal property to be stolen, so do the documents that must be kept secret. No business can deal with the damage done by a breach of confidentiality easily. If every corner of the firm is being rigorously monitored by cameras, It is not impossible for the safety of employees and the company to be guaranteed. Who doesn’t want to work in an environment that is safe? The policy of setting up monitoring cameras is, therefore, an effective way to encourage employee job satisfaction.<br>However, coins have two sides. Having discussed the pros of monitoring, we should also<br>
draw attention to the negative side, which is discussed, as follows.<br>Monitoring employees as a means to improve productivity may, frankly, turn out to be counterproductive and is likely to backfire in certain companies. This issue particularly applies to companies whose business is highly dependent on creativity, like designer companies and entertainment firms which produce videos for social media platforms. Now, it is an era in which the TikTok economy thrives. Many companies hire crews to produce short videos and yield high amounts of revenue. However, the key for TikTok Economy to work is creativity, which is stifled if a person is being monitored. According to a psychological theorem, when a person is doing what they really enjoy, then they are in “the flow”, which means they will feel time flies by quickly. However, if the person is feeling to be forced into doing something, then they will struggle to produce anything usable. The same happens in those firms: if the employees are being closely watched, then they will inevitably feel forced to work, hence producing nothing helpful for the company. In such cases, bankruptcy is the only possible destination for the company. To conclude, for certain industries, monitoring employees may turn out to be counterproductive.<br>The pros and cons of monitoring employees in the workplace are listed and scrutinized above. The question of whether employers should impose such policies, however, cannot be answered by simply listing out the advantages and disadvantages as multiple factors are inextricably interwoven. It is hoped that employees and employers can have a rational and effective communication to reach an agreement on the method of striking a balance between the company’s interests and employees’ privacy.<br><br><br><br>Combined total: 40/42 (5**)]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/hkdse-2023-q4-monitoring-employees.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/HKDSE 2023 Q4 - Monitoring Employees.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blog Entry]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Unveiling the magical town of Japan<br>Greetings! "Konnichiwa" the Japanese word for "hello". After my previous blog to Europe, many readers have asked me to explore Japan. With the suggestions from a lot of avid travellers, especially the one from Blogger "Ming Jai", I snatched a ticket to Tokyo amid this peak travel season. Fellow adventurers! Get ready to embark on an epic journey through the wondrous world of Japan with me! From ancient customs to mind-boggling technology, this country is a captivating blend of tradition and innovation. Buckle up and let's dive into the beauty, history, and cutting-edge wonders that await us!<br>As I arrived (at) Kansai airport, the city's electrifying energy swept me off my feet. Hopping onto the famous JR train, I felt like I as walking into the Instagram reels introducing Japan. Excitement filled the air and I was so ready to set foot on this cool town! Guess where I'm heading to - check out my JR ticket, it's a special edition in December! You are right! We will be en route to Tokyo.<br>"Ding... Ding..." The catchy and iconic tune of Shinjuku station filled my heart with joy. I explored Shinjuku. Leaping out of the East exit, flashing neon lights, towering skyscrapers and plenty of shops caught my eyes. Wow! See this photo of Glico running sign that I attached here. That's truly captivating! I stopped by two incredible food spots: Ichiran Ramen and Sushi Zanmai. Ichiran was famous for its rich, tonkotsu broth and unique solo dining booths - did you know making loud slurping sounds represent your gratitude and appreciation to the chef? I gulped down the bouncy noddles with a loud noise! Also, Sushi Zanmai was a sushi lover's paradise, offering fresh, high-quality sushi at reasonable prices. I couldn't resist trying their fatty tuna, and it was divine!<br>After soaking in the sights of Shinjuku, I hopped on the JR train and headed over to Kyoto. The ride was smooth and scenic, and I enjoyed watching the beautiful countryside whizz by. I remember being impressed by how efficient the JR trains were; they were so punctual! For all reading here, you may download the itinerary that I planned, and also a discount for currency exchange in Kensai airport next time you travel!<br>As a matcha lover, I was like a kid in a candy store about what Kyoto had to offer. Once I arrived, I sought out a traditional tea house to indulge in some matcha. "Hmm", so delicious! Comment down below for a chance to win a deluxe can of matcha powder that I bought. I stumbled upon a cozy little sport where I experience a matcha tea ceremony. The ritual of preparing and serving matcha was mesmerizing. I loved watching the tea master whisk the vibrant green powder into a frothy drink, and the taste was nothing short of heavenly - rich, earthly, and full of flavor. I even tried matcha-flavored sweets, like soft matcha mochi and creamy matcha ice cream, which were delightful. Kyoto truly felt like a matcha paradise!<br>Like my other blogs, I relish reflecting on my experiences. Travelling through Osaka and Kyoto reminded me of the importance of immersing myself in different cultures. From the bustling streets to the serene temples, each experience deepened my understanding of Japan's rich history and traditions. Unlike other bloggers who only talk about shopping. I felt a genuine connection to the people and places I encountered.<br>This trip also inspired me to learn a language. I promised myself to work toward my N5 journey. It's not just about language but about goal setting and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. Every step I take brings me closer to fully embracing the culture and making the most of my travels. This mesmerizing trip reminded me of my favourate Japanese anime "Naruta". One of the famous quotes says, "If you don't like your destiny, don't accept it. Instead, have the courage to change it the way you want to be!"<br>So there you have it - my adventures in Osaka and a quick jaunt to Kyoto were a match made in travel heaven. Whether I was exploring the lively streets of Shinjuku or enjoying a leisurely train ride to Kyoto, I had a blast. If you've been to Osaka, what were your favorite sports?

 <br>
Argue for or against the motion that ‘parents who leave their kids under the age of 15 unattended at home should be punished.’ Write a debate speech.
<br>Good morning adjudicators, ladies and gentlemen,<br>Today our debate motion is ‘parents who leave their kids under the age of 15 unattended at home should be punished’. As the captain of the affirmative team, I hold a fervent belief that today’s motion must under all circumstances justifiable.<br>Fundamental to my stance are several reasons, with parents leaving their kids unattended at home posing a menace to their safety being the first and foremost. I suppose we do not need an expert to convince us that kids are so immature and naive that they are incapable of differentiating between right and wrong, causing them to be prone to a multitude of perils, with the tragic news happening to an innocent girl last week being a flawless illustration. According to a news report from the SCMP, a 5-year-old girl was so inquisitive that she climbed out of the windows of her apartment, causing her to be on the verge of death. But for the quick discovery of her neighbors, she would have fallen off the building. The above case is nothing more than a tip of an iceberg. Our dearest opponents, isn’t it lamentable that kids’ life be threatened at such a tender age? In stark contrast, by means of punishing parents, not only will they be dissuaded from leaving their kids unattended at home, but they will also be instilled with the importance of being vigilant of the safety of their kids and thus devote more time to their safety. In light of this, punishing parents who leave their kids unattended at home is the cornerstone of averting the situation from going beyond remedy.<br>Our respected opponents, you may assert that parents are merely sparing no pains to work in a bid to climb up the social ladder and provide quality life for their kids, as a result of which, they should never be punished. Prima facie, the above claim sounds plausible. Nonetheless, under closer scrutiny, it does not hold much water. While the lofty goal of providing a better living for their kids is commendable itself, it is worth noting that having adequate parental care prevails over having a high quality of living. Ladies and gentlemen, envisage yourself being a 3-year-old child, is your living environment or the support of your parents more essential to you? I bet you weren’t that naive. Definitely the latter, right? Our side firmly believe that in dearth of the care of parents, never will kids grow healthily or happily. Worse still, they may even go astray and morph into unlawful citizens in the long run, for their parents cannot supervise the materials that they are getting access to on a regular basis. Seen in this light, parents who leave kids unattended at home should be punished given that it will pose far-reaching and catastrophic consequences to them.<br>Our dearest opponents, you may also contend that parents who leave their children unattended at home should not be punished as kids will be deprived of parental care, not least when they are in desperate need of the care of their parents at such a tender age. As a result, parents should be imbued with the repercussions of their sinister acts as opposed to punishing them. The above assertion, though of certain validity at first glance, is indeed fallacious. It is worth noting that the government has been making every endeavor to preclude parents from leaving their kids unattended at home throughout the years, whether it be education programs or advertisements. Had these efforts been that effective, we would not have seen a plethora of tragic news regarding parents’ negligence towards their kids throughout the years. By virtue of this, only through punishing these parents could they be deterred from leaving their kids unattended at home.<br>In a nutshell, by no means should parents who leave their kids unattended at home be tolerated. It is high time penalties be imposed on them, lest more kids be put in jeopardy. It is our earnest belief that today’s motion must stand. Thank you.]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/parents-leaving-kids-at-home.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Parents leaving kids at home.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Parents monitoring kids]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
It is known that kids have little ability to take good care of themselves and thus parents should monitor their safety most of the time. However, from parents’ perspectives, to monitor kids all the time is impractical.<br>
Argue for or against the motion that ‘parents who leave their kids under the age of 15 unattended at home should be punished.’ Write a debate speech.
<br>Chairperson, adjudicators and fellow opponents,<br>Good afternoon. The motion today is ‘that it is necessary to punish parents who leave their kids under 15 unattended at home.’ As a representative of the affirmative side, I strongly believe that today’s motion must stand, for the very reason that children’s safety should be the fundamental responsibility of any parents.<br>The first and most important point our side would like to make is that parents should under no circumstances evade the responsibility of taking care of their own kids. Had they been unwilling to take up such duties, they should not have given birth to the kids from the outset. Parents are supposed to bear a burdensome duty of care towards their kids, be vigilant to their kids’ safety at all times, and warn themselves of the sinister consequences of having insufficient control over their kids. Just in the last week, we got a five-year-old lovely and innocent girl fell off from her flat lamentably. An intentional suicide? No! The girl was just so inquisitive that she opened the windows and attempted to sit on it, where she failed to strike a balance and fell off! Had there been someone at home and looked after her, such dangerous acts would have been prevented! This lamentable incident perfectly illustrates the severity of an inadequate monitoring from parents! Our side utterly understands parents’ practical concerns that they cannot but work long hours owing to the huge living costs, only to have sufficient funds for family’s expenditure. However, parents must weigh the importance of the lives of their kids against having decent income.<br>Our fellow opponents, you may argue that, with such enormous pressure in our community, many families have no choice but to be dual-career, with both parents seeking full-time jobs. Otherwise, the grassroots will fail to sustain their minimal living needs. However, any responsible parents should have taken the financial circumstances into consideration before making the decision to give birth to their child. It is the parents who decide to have their child born with limited resources and economic power in the first place. They should not profess, when problems start to arise after giving birth to kids, that they have to work for money. It is time they ponder about the issue seriously – do they want to be more financially-powered at the expense of their kids’ invaluable lives? Our opponent side may further argue that, even if the parents are at fault owing to their carelessness in leaving their kids unattended at rare occasions, they should not receive punishments, lest the kids would have no parents to take care of. While our side recognises that kids barely need a family with parents that surround them with love, warmth and care, we believe that kids should stay away from irresponsible parents. Thus, parents who fail to discharge their fundamental duty of care should be heavily punished. This is necessary to impose a deterrent effect on any parents in our city: without serious penalties, parents may still omit the seriousness and leave their kids at home occasionally. Also, criminal punishments do not necessarily mean that parents will be imposed with custodial sentences such as imprisonment – the Hong Kong law has got many forms of criminal punishments such as community service orders, fines, and suspended sentences. With the education programmes targeted at parents breaking the law, they will be conscious of their own mistakes, genuinely learn a lesson and then rectify them in the future. As such, the kids’ well- being can be more safeguarded in the long run.<br>All in all, penalties should be imposed on parents who fail to exercise due diligence or take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of kids, which is their rudimentary obligation. This is why today’s motion must stand. Thank you!]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/parents-monitoring-kids.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Parents monitoring kids.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Feature article]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Turning to a New Chapter - Escape from Hong Kong<br>In recent years, a significant number of families in Hong Kong have chosen to immigrate abroad, with sought-after destinations including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. According to immigration statistics, over 100,000 Hong Kong residents have moved overseas annually, reflecting a growing trend among city dwellers seeking better opportunities. This trend reveals a combination of factors that compel families to seek a better quality of life outside of their home city. As these city dwellers have been grappling with challenges of high living costs, a fast-paced lifestyle, and intense educational competition, many families are motivated, if not compelled, to seek more favorable environments that offer more stability, peace and opportunities for the junior and senior members of their families. In light of the recent surge in outward immigration movements, this essay will take an in-depth exploration of the underlying reasons driving individuals to seek new opportunities abroad. Followed by the examination of causes, the essay will also propose two practical and feasible solutions to enhance resident retention.<br>One of the primary reasons families decide to relocate from Hong Kong is the immense financial burden associated with living in the city. The cost of living in Hong Kong is notoriously high, making it one of the most expensive places in the world. For instance, rental prices for a modest 200 square meters apartment in central areas can exceed HKD 20,000 per month, leaving little room for other expenses. This financial strain forces many local residents to reconsider their long-term prospects. Families find themselves unable to save adequately for the future, often leading to a cycle of never-ending mortgage and debt. In contrast, countries like Canada and the UK offer a more manageable cost of living, allowing families to maintain a comfortable lifestyle without the overwhelming financial stress they face in Hong Kong.<br>Another crucial factor driving emigration is the desire for a slower, more balanced pace of life. Research indicates that the fast-paced lifestyle in Hong Kong contributes to declining mental health and overall happiness. According to a study by the World Happiness Report, Hong Kong consistently ranks low in global happiness indices, with many residents reporting feelings of stress and anxiety. Families increasingly seek out destinations where they can enjoy a more relaxed lifestyle, which promotes mental well-being and a healthier work-life balance. Countries like Canada and New Zealand are often viewed as ideal options, as they offer a more tranquil environment conducive to family bonding and personal fulfillment.<br>It is also undeniable that the pursuit of better educational opportunities for children has become a driving force behind the immigration trend. The competitive nature of Hong Kong's education system places immense pressure on students from their formative years. It is vividly demonstrated in the staggering figure of 71 students committing suicide in 2023 due to undue academic stress. Parents often feel that the relentless focus on exams and grades compromises their children's well-being and holistic development. In contrast, countries like the UK and the US provide diverse educational pathways that prioritize oriented learning, but they also provide a more diverse choice of professions such as aviation, veterinary medicine and drama. Many families are willing to move abroad in search of a more balanced educational experience that emphasizes their children's overall well-being and personal growth, rather than merely academic success.<br>In conclusion, the decision of many families in Hong Kong to immigrate abroad is influenced by a combination of financial burdens, the desire for a lower pace of life, and the pursuit of better educational opportunities for their children. As they seek to create a more fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle, families and increasingly looking to countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada as viable options for a brighter future. The challenges faced in Hong Kong continue to drive this trend, illustrating the profound impact of socioeconomic factors on family decisions.]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/relocating-from-hong-kong.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Relocating from Hong Kong.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:49:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Social media & Relationships]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
Some people think that social media platforms have facilitated the development of relationships. On the other hand, some people think that such platforms have resulted in more shallow connections.

<br>Write a debate speech.
<br>Argue against the motion “Social media platforms are the places for enhancing social relationships.”

<br>Good morning respected adjudicators, my learned friends from the affirmative and ladies and gentlemen in the audience. I hereby argue against the motion that social media platforms are the places for enhancing social relationships by presenting two main arguments and a rebuttal against the affirmative’s propositions.<br>To begin with, social media platforms hinder genuine communications. Should we step back and think about how we make acquaintances at school, it is without a doubt that face-to-face interactions are the key to reinforcing friendships. Try to recall the beautiful moments when you share your innermost feelings with your buddies and hang around with them at the school campus to enjoy a little escape from chemical equations or comprehension exercise. It is not hard to realize that your tone and facial expressions are equally crucial for your peers to interpret your emotions and thoughts. Face-to-face communications enable people to convey their messages more effectively, enhancing intimacy and hence social relationships. On the other hand, people can use fake names on social media sites. Moreover, messages in the form of words and emojis, which are ambiguous in the way that different people can interpret them differently, are prevalent on social media sites. Despite being able to send messages in the form of audios, the inability to look at the speakers’ facial expressions renders the expression of meaning less effective. Given that it is an uphill battle to have genuine communications on social media sites, they should not be considered the seedbed for enhancing social relationships.<br>Besides hindering genuine communications, social media platforms have also become tools for scammers to generate monetary and sexual benefits. Lily Wong, a student of an accountancy degree at a private university in Malaysia, is reported by South China Morning Post to fly business class, sport handbags by Chanel and Hermes, take foreign trips once every two weeks and receive US$10,000 every month from her 40-year-old sugar daddy, whom she met on The SugarBook website. In another case, a 45-year-old married man who is a user of the sugar-dating site SeekingArrangement, was reported to have sex with a 15-year-old sugar baby. These examples show that some people expect more than just companionship on social media sites. Darren Chan, the founder of The SugarBook, discovered that males generally seek for beauty and sex while females go for money when choosing their life partners. This explains why soliciting sex and money is rife on social media platforms. It is universally acknowledged that relationships built on sex and possessions are not firm and robust. Serving as the medium for the provision of materials and sexual enjoyment, social media platforms should be regarded as the places for transactions rather than boosting social relationships.<br>The affirmative supported their claim by suggesting that social media platforms enable users to reveal their authentic selves so that others could gain a genuine understanding of those users, enhancing intimacy and social relationships. However, revealing authentic selves on social media platforms does not inevitably strength the bonding between people. The anonymity on social media platforms implies that one can release unverified information easily to the public. Consider an incident in 2018 in which a scammer named Karen posted sophistically edited photos and fake personal information on a dating site based in Hong Kong to lure males into having dinner with her in a restaurant which she received commission from. Having appointments with eight males in just a night, she was dubbed a “time management guru” by the news media. This incident shows that while the intention for creating social media sites is to enable users to reveal their genuine side, they can in fact produce fabricated information on those sites. Under this line of thinking, hardly can their followers understand those users thoroughly. Worse still, the fabricated information could be manipulated to deceive others. In this case, can social media platforms still enhance intimacy and reinforce social relationships? The answer is a definite no.<br>As the adage goes, “Nothing is impossible to a willing heart. ”Should the government be willing to closely monitor and scrutinize social media platforms, they could be innocuous without posing any deleterious influence on society. It is our earnest belief that today’s motion must not stand. Thank you!]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/social-media-&amp;-relationships.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Social media &amp; Relationships.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 11:46:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Students morality]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
It is found that schoolmates in your school are in severe lack of morality. You believe that the school has a great role to play for enhancing students’ morality. Write a letter to the principal giving you views that our school should enhance students’ morality.
<br>Dear Ms Lee,<br>I am writing to express my opinion on our students’ declining morality and the desperate need to train their morality. Walking along the corridor, we teachers are not surprised to see students littering, hear them saying foul languages, or even witness them fighting with one another. It is really worth noting that students pay no heed to their behaviour at school, not to mention outside the campus. Not bearing such a worrying sight, I am going to shed light on the three reasons why the school authority should prioritize cultivating students’ morality.<br>The fundamental reason contributing to my suggestion is that the school should shoulder the responsibility to prevent them from going astray. Given that schools are an indispensable socializing agent, they should shoulder the responsibility to instil essential knowledge and moral value into adolescents. In addition, in lack of critical thinking skills, students are vulnerable to problematic belief and disobedience of tedious rules. Should the youngsters run into someone who impart wrongful values to them, they are prone to go astray. It goes without saying that the responsibility of nurturing our future pillars falls on the school. In light of this, it seems more urgent and crucial for the school, as well as we teachers, to ensure that students can act in accordance with the ethics in society. None of us would like to see one of our students become a member of gang, smoking and disobeying the laws, would we? Owing to teachers’ respected status, the young will be less reluctant to abide by what teachers say. On Parents’ Day, a wealth of concerned parents share with me that their children usually turn a deaf ear to their guidance, be it friendly or solemn. Having no idea on how to change their sons and daughters’ poor habits, a vast majority of them resort to seeking help from teachers. In view of this, it is incumbent on the school and teachers to stop the young from being influenced by the morally flawed, thereby nurturing their morality. This explains the significance of training students’ morality.<br>Besides, training students’ discipline goes a long way towards maintaining the school’s reputation. In the wake of soaring complaints as to our students’ misbehaviour, it has come to our realization that their misconduct has seriously disparaged the school’s reputation. Based on the complaints we have gathered from residents living in proximity of our school, we discover that students’ moral standards have fallen sharply. Many of them are criticised for being apathetic towards the needy in society, ranging from not giving seats to the needy on the bus to posing barbarous gestures to the pedestrians. With such inconsiderate and rude behavior of our students, it is little wonder that people question the school’s quality teaching, wreaking havoc on our reputation. To alleviate the current situation before it goes beyond remedy, it is suggested that we nurture students’ morality. Only by this measure can we ensure that their behaviour, be it at school or outside the campus, is up to par. Their enhanced morality can restore parents’ confidence to us, so that they can be more reassured to send their kids to study here. It is also believed that with the improved reputation of our school, more students will enrol in our school, fostering our long-term development.<br>Antagonists oppose this idea, claiming that students’ academic results always outweigh their ethical level. Granted, acquisition of knowledge plays a pivotal role in nurturing the intelligence of the young. However, what we should give precedence to at kids’ tender age is the indoctrination of value judgment into kids as opposed to a sea of academic knowledge. Should the defective moral values be deep-seated in their mind, hardly can we alter their wrongful mindset, despite rolling out harsh punishment or with sufficient help. According to a research conducted by Hong Kong Correctional Services Department, 75% of the prisoners admit that the reason why they fail to turn over a leaf is that their value judgment has already been entrenched in their mind for long and it is a tall order to fix their problematic value judgment when they become grown-ups. This demonstrates why moral education is of paramount importance at school, given that deeply ingrained concepts can scarcely be changed. To pave a path for our students to embrace their bright future, we should strictly bear no discrepancy in their moral values. To this end, it is wise for us to give priority to value education over imparting knowledge.<br>All in all, for the sake of our future pillars, the school is obliged to monitor and train their morality now without any delay. It is our sincere hope that all of our students can possess a successful and flawless future life, without going astray.<br>Mr Wong<br>

 <br><br>The teenage dilemma<br>One more student committed suicide last week. This heartbreaking news has provoked everyone's attention to the challenges students face in Hong Kong. In fact, stress among local students has been prevalent. However, it raises the question of why students are experiencing such high levels of stress without having someone to turn to for support. To prevent further tragedies, it is crucial to understand the underlying causes of their duties and work towards establishing a support system for students in need.<br>One major cause of stress among teenagers is the immense academic pressure they face. Many students express concerns about their studies, as they perceive success in academics as a pathway to securing a well-paid job. A recent survey conducted by our school reveals that a majority of students suffer from insomnia due to tremendous academic stress. Additionally, parental expectations play a significant role, as parents often have high aspirations for their children's academic achievements. In Chinese culture, the emphasis on success, particularly in terms of promising careers, further adds fuels to the pressure felt by teenagers.<br>Emotional challenges also contribute to teenage stress. Peer pressure and the need for social approval can be overwhelming for teenagers. The influence of social media, where popularity is measured by likes and validation, adds to the emotional burden. It is not uncommon to see kids hurting themselves or even taking their own lives due to social media problems, namely, cyber-bullying or a low self-esteem. In addition, teenagers may feel the need to conceal their problems due to a generation gap that limits effective communication and understanding between them and their parents.<br>Despite the challenges faced by our helpless adolescents, there are a myraid of practical solutions to alleviate their academic and emotional problems. Let's delve into (how) our educators and parties involved can help save our poor teens form their predicament.<br>To alleviate academic stress, schools should consider implementing measures that promote a balanced learning environment. Firstly, reducing the amount of homework can help alleviate the burden on students, allowing them to have more time for relaxation and pursuing other interests. It is revealed in our recent survey that students find homework the major source of their stress. It is believe that reducing the amount of homework can relieve students' mental burden. Secondly, the introduction of e-learning platforms and technology-based teaching methods can enhance the efficiency of learning, providing students with more interactive and personalized educational experiences. With the introduction of i-Pad learning and our "e-ask" interactive AI answering machine in class, a lot of students who benefit from the innovative measures express that their efficacy of learning is greatly enhanced.<br>To tackle emotional problems, schools can initiate a "Happiness Campaign" aimed at promoting well-being among students. This campaign could include organizing relaxing day trips and entertainment activities within the school environment. Creating opportunities for students to engage in recreational and stress-reliving activities can help alleviate emotional stress and foster a positive school atmosphere. As "Anson Lo" and "Jeremy" from the sensational boyfriend Mirror are popular idols of our teenagers, they could be invited to cheer our depressed teenagers up. Additionally, schools can employ social workers or counsellors who are professional to provide practical help and support to students facing emotional challenges.<br>Teenage stress is a complex issue influence by academic pressure and emotional problems. By implementing a multi-faceted approach, schools can play a vital role in alleviating stress among teenagers. Reducing academic workload and integrating technology in education can enhance the learning experience, while organizing happiness campaigns and providing professional support can address emotional challenges. It is of paramount importance to education all our future pillars of society that, "No one is immune to stress", but they should also (be) reminded that we are always here to show our unconditional love and unfailing support.<br><br>Dear Ms Chan,<br>I would like to begin by expressing my sincere gratitude for your exemplary leadership at Hong Kong College. Your commitment to fostering a nurturing and supportive environment for our students is truly commendable. However, the recent suicide attempt of our student from 5D has raised the concern of not only students but parents. Recent studies from MindHK reveal that Hong Kong faces one of the highest rates of depression and anxiety in the world, with nearly half of our youth experiencing symptoms of depression. In the face of this undesirable situation, I am writing to propose effective solutions to alleviate the anxiety and stress of our students.<br>Rationale<br>
With a view to examining sources of stress and their impact on mental health, our Student Council has launched a survey targeting at senior form students. It is shocking that a significant number of students reported having suicidal (thoughts) due to overwhelming academic stress, which highlighted the severity of the mental health challenges faced by students. Nearly 30% of students reported experiencing symptoms of depression, and 25% of students reported symptoms of anxiety. This situation underscores the urgent need for immediate intervention and support.<br>Additionally, our findings reveal a dramatic decline in happiness levels among students, dropping from an average of 7 to 5 in the scale of 10. This decline highlights that academic pressure exert emotional toll on our students. As for the reasons behind their stress, approximately 80% reported that they were snowed under academic work in school. In light of these alarming figures, it is imperative that we launch a comprehensive mental health campaign to provide the necessary resources and support for our students' well-being.<br>To cope with the situation, a campaign and a measure will be proposed. The solutions are devised based on our research and survey results targeting at what students need.<br>Mental Health and Wellbeing Campaign<br>
A comprehensive mental health and well-being campaign on campus is advised to be launched in a bid to help students relax and prioritize self-care. One key component would be the implementation of stress-reliving workshops and classes. Coaches from MindHK, a non-governmental youth organization that focuses on youth mental health, would be invited to guide students in meditation practices and art therapy workshops. Not only are the coaches popular among a lot of local secondary schools, but the program is also free. It is hoped that these activities will provide students with healthy coping mechanisms and outlets for managing the intense pressures they face when tackling the public examination. Additionally, it is proposed that the school should invite Anson Lo and Keung To, popular idols of students in our school, to perform. It has been revealed in the recent survey that a majority of students wish to meet their idols in person. It is believed that their presence and encourage would create endless happiness for students.<br>Reducing Academic Workload<br>
As previously mentioned, students are overwhelmed by the volume of homework, projects and tests they are expected to complete each week. Therefore, it is hoped that the school should adopt a multi-faceted approach to reduce the immense academic workload. The panels in the school should critically examine their curriculum to ensure students are not overburdened by mandatory coursework. It should be specified that most S.4 and S.5 students express discontentment with having 3 Chinese writings and 3 Mathematics Quiz a month. It is suggested that more time can be devoted to interactive and out-of-classroom learning, to not only alleviate the stress of students but also the pressure of teachers. Alongside the curriculum changes, rules should be established to limit the maximum amount of homework assigned per class and night to prevent students from pending excessive hours for completing assignments. Coordinating assessment and homework schedules could be effective in avoiding students having multiple tests and assignments due in the same week, distributing the workload more evenly.<br>Conclusion<br>
These holistic efforts to introduce stress-relieving activities and reform the academic structures could adequately ameliorate students' stress while preserving academic standard. While I whole-heartedly appreciate your remarkable leadership and contribution to the school, I sincerely hope that you would welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal in grater detail with our team of student leaders. I am sure that we can address this mental health crisis hand-in-hand, and develop the best support system in town to further consolidate our school's reputation as "the most wonderful school" in Kowloon. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to your favourable reply.<br>Yours sincerely,<br>

 <br>
Write a letter in response to Amy Chua's article which supports strict parenting.
<br>Dear Ms. Chua,<br>Having read your renowned work "Why Chinese Mothers are superior", I would like to take a moment to express my thoughts on your parenting style. Mounting suicide rates among teenagers have raised alarms about the stress of students under Asian education system. While I acknowledge the merit in your arguments about discipline and high expectations, I must respectfully disagree with several points based on my own experiences.<br>To begin with, I believe your tiger mum approach imposes a heavy mental toll on children. The academic pressure to excel in every subject, to achieve perfect grades can lead to severe anxiety and burnout. Research has shown that high levels of parental pressure can lead to mental health issues in children, including anxiety and depression. While teenage suicide rates have hit the headlines in Hong Kong and other Asian communities, the decline in happiness among school children has posed a headache to parents. If students experience chronic stress, it will affect both their physical and mental well-being. Authoritarian parenting has undoubtedly created a traumatic childhood for all Asian children and teenagers.<br>Additionally, I believe that the strict parenting style stifle(s) creativity. A helicopter parent may limit a child's ability to explore their own interests and passions. From my experience, having the freedom to pursue my interest develops my imagination and motivation. When children are allowed to explore their creativity in arts, sports, or other fields - they often discover unique talents and develop a sense of self. An array of research from renowned universities has revealed the negative impact of fierce shouting and scolding on a child's creative development. Celebrities like J.K. Rowling, Elon Musk and Steve Jobs are all intrinsically motivated. Who can deny the fact that the most powerful tool is trusting one's inner voice instead of being strictly instructed? It should be stressed that a more lenient and supportive parenting approach is essential to nurturing a talented kid.<br>Furthermore, mounting parental pressure can create tension in the parent-child relationship. A study conducted by researchers at the University of California found that children who felt their parents were overly controlling reported negative feelings to their parents. This can hinder open communication and emotional connection. Imagine a society filled with arguments and family conflicts, if not domestic violence. What would it be like? It is undeniable that behind every nagging and harsh word, every parent just hopes the best for their kids. It would put the cart before the horse to build a so-called promising future for children at the cost of trust in parent-child relationship.<br>I truly appreciate your insights and I understand your desire to do what is best for children. However, I believe a more balanced approach to support our young ones is essential. Afterall, who doesn't want a bright yet loving and affectionate child? Who doesn't hope for the best and the happiest life for a child? Thank you for your thoughtful essay, and I hope my opinions can inspire all on a more desirable parenting approach.<br>Yours truly,<br>

 <br><br>Good morning students. A heated topic of our schoolmates is Genshin Impact, and every one is obsessed with the game. Do you ever find yourself feeling tired or unfocused during your lessons? Maybe your eyes feel strained, or you have a hard time concentrating? One of the main culprits could be spending too much time playing video games first thing in the morning. Being an avid player in the past, I used to game heavily until my academic results go (went) terribly wrong and my vision become blurry all the time. As someone who has been through the disaster of video game obsession, I would like to share my two cents on why you should not be addicted to video games.<br>Do you know the biggest consequence of endless video-gaming? That is definitely the toll on physical health. When you wake up and immediately start gaming, it puts a lot of strain on your eyes and brain. Research has shown that the screen will severely impair your vision, leading to early diagnosis of cataract. Worse still, the blue light from screens can disrupt your natural sleep-wake cycle, and intense gaming sessions can leave your feeling drained and lethargic rather than energized for the day. Not only will excessive gaming harm your vision, it will also dread your energetic soul.<br>In addition, it is detrimental to your academic result. When you're distracted and fatigued from excessive gaming, it becomes much harder to focus and engage during your lessons. You may find yourself struggling to follow along with the material, or having a hard time retaining the information presented. This can lead to lower test scores, worse overall academic performance, and a general lack of progress in your education. Our student council's survey shows that the majority of students who game heavily in the mornings tend to have less satisfactory academic performance compared to their peers. It's a clear sign that there is an imbalance happening - too much time spent on entertainment and not enough on the studies that should be your top priority.<br>Instead of jumping straight into video games, I encourage you all to try a different routine of staying unplugged. Maybe take 30 minutes to go for a quick walk, have a healthy breakfast, or read a book. Engaging in calming, low-screen activities in the morning can help you feel more alert and ready to learn when you get to your classrooms. I have tried that myself. After engaging in off-screen 10-min work a day, I become so much more positive, sharp-witted and even charming! Let's embark on this journey together, to revive our spirit, not to dampen it!<br>I know video games are fun and it can be tempting to get in some gaming time before school. But trust me, your mind and body will thank you if you limit that screen time in the mornings. You'll find you have more energy, better focus, and are able to get much more out of your lessons. So let's all make a pledge to be more mindful of our morning habits. Put down the controllers, close the laptops, and give your eyes and brain a break. I guarantee you'll see a difference in how you feel and perform at school. Thank you, and have a wonderful rest of your day!]]></description><link>english/writings/samples/video-games.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">English/Writings/Samples/Video games.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:49:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why total smoking ban is essential]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>
<br>Introduction

<br>Introducing the topic:<br>
In recent years, the issue of total smoking ban has caused controversy in our society.
<br>Explaining +ve/-ve stance:<br>
As for the business sector and investors, they believe that a territory-wide smoking ban in all entertainment venues is detrimental to their business. However, others think that if entertainment venues such as mahjong parlours are exempted, public health will be jeopardized.
<br>Explaining your stance:<br>
In my opinion, it is urgent for the government to implement total smoking ban in Hong Kong. In the following, I will explain my arguments.


<br>Economic impact

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
To start with, we should note that the importance of health outweighs the economic impact of imposing a total ban on smoking.
<br>Explaining the situation (general trends, data, individual examples, comparisons):<br>
It is apparent that smoking is harmful to our health. As we all know, smoking could result in a few nasty side-effects, such as bad skin as well as poor breath and fitness. If we are smokers, we will frequently pant after doing intense exercise. More importantly, smoking can cause lung cancer and heart disease, which lead to death. According to scientific research in recent years, second-hand smoke is even more toxic and fatal than first-hand smoke.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
Therefore, preventing smokers from killing themselves and others, including both customers and staff, is an urgent public health issue.


<br>Safety (in entertainment venues)

<br>Topic sentence:<br>
In addition, total smoking ban can improve the safety in entertainment venues.
<br>Explaining the situation (general trends, data, individual examples, comparisons):<br>
In Hong Kong, it is common to find these venues in the old buildings in old districts like Sham Shui Po and Yau Ma Tei. As everyone knows, abandoned cigarettes often lead to fire. In case of a fire, smoke can spread to different areas rapidly. To make the matters worse, the evacuation routes of old buildings are sometimes blocked by rubbish. If a serious fire breaks out, customers of entertainment venues will not be able to escape from the scene and heavy casualties will result.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
Hence, it is essential for the government to adopt total smoking ban.


<br>Rebuttal

<br>State other’s stance:<br>
Despite the arguments above, many people still emphasize that territory-wide smoking ban will significantly reduce the number of customers in entertainment venues and exacerbate the unemployment problem.
<br>Politely address the other’s stance:<br>
Undeniably, the ban will adversely affect the business of these venues.
<br>Point of rebuttal:<br>
Nevertheless, we should remember that the health cost of smoking is tremendous.
<br>Explaining the situation (general trends, data, individual examples, comparisons):<br>
According to a research done by Hong Kong University, the annual cost of treating the diseases related to smoking is over 5 billion dollars. As mentioned above, smoking is a culprit of chronic diseases like lung cancer and heart disease. Since most people in Hong Kong consume public medical services, the cost of treating smokers will pose a huge financial burden to our government.
<br>Point of conclusion:<br>
Considering the cost and benefits, territory-wide smoking ban should definitely be implemented for the sake of the welfare of our whole society.


<br>Conclusion

<br>Restate your stance + Summary:<br>
In conclusion, the government should implement total smoking ban as it can safeguard the health of the general public and prevent fire disasters. While it will engender short-term economic pain, the colossal long-term cost of smoking will be minimized.
<br>End in high spirits (What the government should do):<br>
Therefore, the government should not hesitate anymore. It should adopt the measure as soon as possible.
