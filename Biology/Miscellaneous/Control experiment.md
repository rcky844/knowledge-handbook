- Between two set-ups, only the independent variable is changed, as it is the factor under investigation.
- The dependent variable changes according to the independent variable. It is the outcome.
- Control variables are all the other factors that may affect the dependent variables. They are kept constant to ensure the experiment is a fair test.

- An experimental set-up is one in which the factor to be studied is present.
- A control set-up is one in which the factor to be studied is absent.
