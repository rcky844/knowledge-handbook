##### Nutrition
Organisms obtain food and nutrients for [[respiration]] to produce energy.
- **Green plants (autotrophs)**: Make their own food by photosynthesis.
- **Animals (heterotrophs)**: Eat plants or other animals for food.

##### Respiration
Organisms exchange gases between the air and its cells.
- **External respiration (breathing)**: Involves inhalation and exhalation of gases.
- **Internal respiration**: Gas exchange between the blood and body cells.
- **Cellular respiration**: The [[Respiration|conversion]] of food molecules into energy.

##### Excretion
Organisms remove wastes produced by metabolic reactions occurring in their bodies.
- **Animals**: Excrete waste in the form of exhaled gas, sweat and urine.
	- Egestion is not a form of excretion, as it involves the removal of undigested food.
- **Plants**:
	- By shedding leaves stored with wastes continuously or during a particular season.
	- Excreted as resin.

##### Sensitivity (Irritability)
Organisms can detect stimuli and produce appropriate responses accordingly.
- **Animals**: Have sensory organs to detect and muscular systems to respond to stimuli.
- **Plants**: Detect and grow towards light and water.

##### Movement (Locomotion)
Organisms can show movement with or without moving from its original position.
- **Animals**: Move around to search for food, find mates, escape from danger, etc.
- **Plants**: Anchored into soil by roots, but some parts of plants show movement.

##### Growth
The growth and increasing body size and complexity of organisms.

##### Reproduction
The production of offspring to ensure the continuity of life.
