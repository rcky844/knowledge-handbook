**Active transport** is an active process of transporting substances <u>across the cell membrane against the conc. gradient</u> with the use of energy from [[Respiration]]. It involves specific [[Membrane proteins#Carrier proteins|carrier proteins]] on the cell membrane and <u>occurs only in living cells</u>.

<u>Factors influencing the rate of respiration (e.g. temperature, oxygen concentration) affect the rate of active transport.</u>

#### Importance
- Facilitates the <u>active uptake of minerals from the soil into the roots of plants</u>.
- Involved in the <u>reabsorption of useful substances</u> (e.g. glucose, amino acids) in the <span style="color: violet">kidney tubules</u> in humans.
- <u>Speeds up the absorption of small water-soluble molecules</u> (e.g. monosaccharides, amino acids, minerals, certain vitamins) into blood in the [[small intestine]].
