**Osmosis** refers to the <u>net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential across a differentially / selectively permeable membrane</u>.

#### Water potential
![[water_potential_diagram.webp|120]]
**Water potential**, also known as **osmotic pressure**, is a measure of the <u>concentration of free moving water molecules</u>. It describes the tendency for water molecules to diffuse from one place to another.

It is <u>inversely proportional to the solute concentration of a solution</u>. (i.e. the more concentrated a solution, the lower the water potential)

#### Effects to cells (movement of water)
##### In an isotonic solution
![[osmosis_isotonic.webp|350]]
- <u>No water potential gradient</u> between the cells and extracellular fluid.
- <u>No net movement of water molecules</u> into or out of the cell.

##### In a hypotonic solution
- <u>Lower water potential</u> in the cytoplasm than the extracellular fluid.
- <u>Net gain of water</u> by osmosis.
	- **Animal cells**: Swells and eventually bursts.
	  ![[osmosis_hypotonic_animal.webp|250]]
	- **Plant cells**: Vacuole and cytoplasm swell and cell membrane is pressed firmly against the cell wall. Rigid cell wall prevents them from bursting, the cell becomes [[Support in plants#Turgidity of thin-walled cells|turgid]].

##### In a hypertonic solution
- <u>Higher water potential</u> in the cytoplasm than the extracellular fluid.
- <u>Net loss of water</u> by osmosis.
	- **Animal cells**: Shrink and becomes wrinkled.

	- **Plant cells**: Becomes plasmolysed (cell membrane detaches from the cell wall).

#### Importance
- <u>Absorption of soil water and movement of water from one cell to another in plants.</u>
	- When plant cells gain water, the cells become [[Turgidity|turgid]] and press against each other, this provides the <u>means of support in young seedlings and non-woody plants</u>.
	- When plant cells lose water significantly, the cells become flaccid and the plant wilts.
- Most of the water in food is absorbed by osmosis in the human [[small intestine]].

> - Glucose is soluble in water, so it can affect the water potential of a solution.
> - Starch is insoluble in water, so it does not affect the water potential of a solution.
