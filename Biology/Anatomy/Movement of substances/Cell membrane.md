When in water or aqueous solution, the **cell membrane** is a [[Lipids#Phospholipids|phospholipid]] bilayer surrounding all cells. The bilayer consists mainly of phospholipid molecules and interspersed protein molecules. It is also <span style="color: violet">differentially permeable</span>, allowing control of the movement of substance into and out of the cell.

The fluid mosaic model is a scientific model proposed by S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson to explain the structure of the cell membrane.
- The bilayer is <u>fluid in nature</u>, phospholipid molecules and some protein molecules <u>can move laterally</u>.
- Proteins are <u>interspersed</u> within the bilayer and distributed in a <u>mosaic pattern / asymmetric manner</u>.

#### Components

1. [[Phospholipid (Cell membrane)|Phospholipid]]\
2. [[Membrane proteins]]

#### Properties & functions

1. **Flexible and strong**
	- The fluid nature of the cell membrane allows it to <u>break and fuse</u>. This allows cells to change shape during cell growth, [[Nuclear division|cell division]] and [[Phagocytosis]].
		- Phospholipid molecules are <u>not chemically bonded</u>, but only held by weak [[intermolecular forces]], which allows it to move slightly. (Fluid in nature)

	- The cell membrane is thin but strong enough to hold the cell contents. This is because:
		- [[Intermolecular forces]] between large numbers of molecules are collectively strong.
		- Protein molecules among the phospholipid bilayer provide strength.
		- <span style="color: violet">Cholesterol</span> plays pivotal roles in maintaining the structural integrity and regulating the fluidity of cell membranes.

2. **Differentially permeable**
   ![[cell_membrane_permeability.webp|500]]
	- Cell membrane is <u>permeable to small, non-polar molecules</u> (e.g. oxygen, carbon dioxide) and <u>lipid-soluble substances</u> (e.g. alcohol, lipid soluble vitamins and lipid hormones), as they can dissolve in the bilayer.
	- Cell membrane is <u>impermeable to ions and polar molecules</u> (e.g. water, water-soluble substances), as they are repelled by the bilayer. Instead, they move across the cell membrane through [[Membrane proteins|channel proteins or carrier proteins]].
