The **lungs** are two spongy, pinkish organs close to the heart in the <span class="hi-blue">thoracic cavity</span>.
- [[Trachea, bronchi and bronchioles#Bronchioles|Bronchioles]] end in clusters of air sacs inside of the lungs.
- <span class="hi-green">Slight negative pressure</span> within the thoracic cavity aids in keeping the airways of the lungs open.

- **The lungs contain no muscles, and cannot expand or contract on their own.**
  Breathing is brought about by the <span class="hi-green">movements of intercostal muscles and the diaphragm</span>. The diaphragm is a dome-shaped sheet of muscles below the lungs that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity.
<br>
- **The lungs are surrounded and protected by the rib cage.**
  The [[Human skeleton#Rib cage|rib cage]] is formed by 12 pairs of ribs, the sternum and the vertebral column, with the <span class="hi-blue">intercostal muscles</span> lying between them.

> [!tip]
> The lung is an elastic structure that tends to decrease its size at all volumes. If there is a leakage of air, the lungs would collapse.

*Pleural membranes*:
- Each lung is <span class="hi-green">enclosed by two pleural membranes</span>. The inner membrane is attached to the lungs, while the outer membrane lines the <span class="hi-blue">thoracic cavity</span>.
- They form a narrow space between the two membranes called the <span class="hi-blue">pleural cavity</span>, which always maintain a negative pressure.
- They secrete <span class="hi-blue">pleural fluid</span> into the cavity to <span class="hi-green">reduce friction between the lungs and the rib cage</span> during breathing movements.
