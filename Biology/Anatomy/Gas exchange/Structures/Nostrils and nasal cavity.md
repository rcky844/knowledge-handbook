# Nostrils
**Nostrils** are the entry for air.
- They are lined with <span class="hi-blue">nasal hairs</span>, forming a [[Physical barriers|physical barrier]] to filter out dust and other particles from air.

# Nasal cavity
**Nasal cavity** is the space inside the nose.

*Types of cells*:
- The wall is lined with <span class="hi-blue">mucus-secreting cells</span> secreting mucus, which <span class="hi-green">traps dust particles and bacteria</span> and also <span class="hi-green">moistens the incoming air</span> to a saturated level.
- The wall is also lined with <span class="hi-blue">ciliated epithelial cells</span>. The cilia extending out of these cells <span class="hi-green">beat in a wave-like manner</span>. This beating action <span class="hi-green">sweeps the mucus</span> towards the [[Pharynx and larynx|pharynx]] (throat) where it is either swallowed or coughed out.

*Adaptations of the wall*:
- It is well supplied with <span class="hi-blue">blood capillaries</span> which helps <span class="hi-green">warm the incoming air</span>.
- The cells on the wall are <span class="hi-green">closely-packed</span>, forming a [[Physical barriers|physical barrier]] to prevent pathogens from entering body tissues.
