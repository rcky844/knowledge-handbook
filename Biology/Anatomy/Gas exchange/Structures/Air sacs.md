*Adaptations*:
- Air sacs are **very numerous in number**, providing a <span class="hi-green">large surface area</span> for diffusion of gases.
- The inner surfaces of the air sacs are **covered with a moist water film** with watery mucus. This <span class="hi-green">allows oxygen to dissolve</span> in it and <span class="hi-green">diffuse across the alveolar wall more readily</span>.
- The **alveolar wall is one-cell thick** and composed of only one layer of <span class="hi-blue">epithelial cell</span>, providing a <span class="hi-green">short distance for diffusion of gases</span>.
- Air sacs are surrounded by a **dense network of blood capillaries**, providing a <u>rich blood supply</u> to <span class="hi-green">readily transport gases</span> between the blood and the air sacs and <span class="hi-green">maintain a steep concentration gradient of gases</span>.
- The **alveolar wall lie close to the blood capillaries**, reducing the diffusion distance for diffusion of gases between the blood and the air sacs.

> [!tip]
> The outer walls of air sacs contain elastic protein fibres, which makes the air sacs elastic, allowing them to expand and shrink.
> Once the intercostal and diaphragm muscles relax, the air sacs shrinks (recoils) and return to their original size. This allows exhalation to occur even without muscles contractions of the lungs or air sacs themselves.

# Diseases & complications
## Accumulation of fluids
Patients with lung inflammation may have fluid accumulated in the air sacs.
- It <span class="hi-green">increases the distance for diffusion</span> of gases.
- It <span class="hi-green">reduces the surface area of the water film for dissolving gases</span>.

## Dust deposition
When dusty air is breathed in, the mechanisms to filter out the dust may be overwhelmed, allowing dust to deposit on the surfaces of the air sacs.
- It forms a <span class="hi-blue">barrier</span> and <span class="hi-green">increases the diffusion distance</span>.
- Significant portions of the inner surface of the air sacs can be blocked by dust, <span class="hi-green">reducing the surface area for diffusion</span> of gases.
- Hardened layer of dust can <span class="hi-green">reduce the elasticity of lungs</span>, and reduces the volume of the lungs when it inflates.
