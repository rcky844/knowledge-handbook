![[trachea_bronchi.avif|650]]

- The **trachea** is a passage for air that <span class="hi-green">runs next to the oesophagus</span>, with <span class="hi-blue">C-shaped rings of cartilage</span> in its walls to <u>keep it open for air</u> to pass through freely, while <u>allowing the oesophagus next to it to expand</u> when food passes down it.
- The **bronchus** is supported by <span class="hi-blue">complete rings of cartilage</span>.
- The **bronchioles** does not have cartilage.

> [!tip]
> If there is no cartilage to support the trachea, it would collapse due to the <span class="hi-green">negative pressure created during inhalation</span>.

> [!note]
> The inner walls of <span class="hi-blue">trachea, bronchus and larger bronchioles</span> are lined with ciliated epithelial cells and mucus-secreting cells.
