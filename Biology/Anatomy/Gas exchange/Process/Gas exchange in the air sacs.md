# Process
![[gas_exchange_air_sacs_capillaries.webp]]

## Before gas exchange
- <span class="hi-green">Pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood</span> from the heart to the capillaries surrounding the air sacs.

## During gas exchange
- **Oxygen** in inhaled fresh air <span class="hi-green">dissolves in the water film</span> on the inner surface of the air sacs, and [[Diffusion|diffuses]] across the alveolar wall and capillary wall into the blood <u>down a concentration gradient</u> to <span class="hi-green">combine with haemoglobin</span> in red blood cells.
- **Carbon dioxide** in the blood diffuses across the alveolar wall and capillary wall into the air sacs <u>down a concentration gradient</u>, it is then <span class="hi-green">removed in exhaled air</span> when we <u>breathe out</u>.

## After gas exchange
- Blood is <span class="hi-green">oxygenated</span> and <span class="hi-green">returns to the heart</span> by the <span class="hi-blue">pulmonary veins</span>.

# Composition of inhaled and exhaled air
*Involved in gas exchange*:
- **Oxygen**: inhaled air (21%) > exhaled air (16%)
  Oxygen diffuses into the blood in the air sacs and are then taken up by body cells for [[respiration]].

- **Carbon dioxide**: inhaled air (0.03%) < exhaled air (4%)
  Carbon dioxide is produced by body cells during [[respiration]] and diffuses from blood into the air sacs for exhaling.

> [!warning]
> Exhaled air does not contain more carbon dioxide than oxygen.

*Other substances*:
- **Nitrogen & noble gases**: unchanged (78% + 1%)
  These gases are not used or produced by body cells.

- **Water vapour**: variable → saturated
  Exhaled air is moistened by the water film in the air sacs and the mucus in the respiratory tract.

- **Temperature**: variable → ~34°C
  Exhaled air is warmed by the blood capillaries surrounding the air sacs and lining the respiratory tract.
