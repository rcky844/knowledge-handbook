**Ventilation** refers to an <span class="hi-blue">active</span> movement of air into and out of the lungs to help <span class="hi-green">maintain a steep concentration gradient of gases</span> so that gas exchange can occur efficiently. It is brought about by the <span class="hi-green">movements of intercostal muscles and the diaphragm</span>.

# Process
> [!tip]
> - Changes in lung volume also changes the pressure in the lungs.
> - Changes in lung volume is the result of the changes in volume of the thoracic cavity.

## Inhalation
![[inhalation.webp|200]]

- **Intercostal muscles** contract, the <span class="hi-blue">rib cage</span> moves upwards and outwards.
- **Diaphragm muscles** contract, the <span class="hi-blue">diaphragm</span> becomes <span class="hi-blue">flattened</span>.
- **Volume of thoracic cavity** increases, the lungs expand and lung volume increases.
- **Air pressure in the lungs** becomes <span class="hi-green">lower than atmospheric pressure</span>, air is drawn into the lungs.

## Exhalation

- **Intercostal muscles** relax, the <span class="hi-blue">rib cage</span> moves downwards and inwards.
- **Diaphragm muscles** relax, the <span class="hi-blue">diaphragm</span> returns to its original dome shape.
- **Volume of thoracic cavity** decreases, the lungs deflate and lung volume decreases.
- **Air pressure in the lungs** becomes <span class="hi-green">higher than atmospheric pressure</span>, air is forced out the lungs.
