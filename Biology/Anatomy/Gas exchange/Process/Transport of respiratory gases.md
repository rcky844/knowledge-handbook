# Oxygen
> [!tip] Transport methods
> - Transported in the blood and carried by [[Red blood cells]] (>98%)
> - Transported as dissolved oxygen in blood plasma. (<2%)

## Process
![[oxygen_transport.webp|600]]

*In the lungs*:
- <span class="hi-green">Oxygen concentration in the air sacs is higher</span> than plasma as fresh air is inhaled continuously.
- Oxygen dissolves in a thin water film on the inner wall of the air sac, and diffuses across the wall of air sac into plasma as oxygen concentration is lower in blood.
- Oxygen [[Diffusion|diffuses]] from plasma into red blood cells to combine with haemoglobin to form <span class="hi-blue">oxyhaemoglobin</span>, which gives the blood its bright red colour.
- Oxygenated blood is transported to tissues by the circulatory system.

*In body tissues*:
- <span class="hi-green">Oxygen content of tissue fluid is lower than that of blood</span>, as body cells continuously take up oxygen from the blood for [[respiration]].
- <span class="hi-blue">Oxyhaemoglobin</span> dissociates to become oxygen and haemoglobin, with oxygen leaving the blood and diffuses into the tissue fluid.
- After releasing most of its oxygen, the blood becomes deoxygenated and is dark purplish red in colour.

# Carbon dioxide
> [!tip] Transport methods
> - Transported as hydrogencarbonate ions in the plasma. (~70%)
> - Transported by binding to haemoglobin in the red blood cells as carbaminohaemoglobin. (~23%)
> - Transported as dissolved carbon dioxide in blood plasma. (small amount)

## Process
![[carbon_dioxide_transport.webp|600]]

*In the lungs*:
- <span class="hi-green">Carbon dioxide content in body tissues is higher</span> than plasma, as carbon dioxide is continuously produced by cells during [[respiration]].
- Carbon dioxide enters the tissue fluid from the cells and diffuses into the plasma, which then diffuses into red blood cells, where carbon dioxide chemically react with water to form <span class="hi-blue">bicarbonate ions</span>.
- Carbon dioxide then diffuses from red blood cells to plasma, and are transported to air sacs of the lungs in this form.

*In body tissues*:
- <span class="hi-green">Carbon dioxide concentration in the air sacs is lower</span> than plasma, as air in the air sacs is exhaled continuously.
- <span class="hi-blue">Bicarbonate ions</span> diffuses into red blood cells and undergo a chemical reaction with water to re-form carbon dioxide.
- Carbon dioxide moves into plasma from red blood cells and finally diffuses into the air sacs and exhaled.
