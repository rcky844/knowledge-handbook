*Pre-context: [[Homeostasis]]*

**Thermoregulation** is an example of [[homeostasis]] in humans, and occurs through the [[negative feedback system]].

#### Components
##### Receptors
The **receptors** are <span style="color: skyblue">thermoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> and in the [[skin]].
- **In the hypothalamus**: Detect the temperature of the blood
- **In the skin**: Detect the temperature of the skin

##### Control centre
The **control centre** is the <span style="color: skyblue">thermoregulatory centre</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> of the brain.
- Monitors and controls the core body temperature.
- Receives nerve impulses from receptors about temperature changes.

**Division by functionality**:
- **Heat gain centre**: Stimulated when temperature is lower than normal and coordinates effectors to initiate responses that increase heat gain and reduce heat loss.
- **Heat loss centre**: Stimulated when temperature is higher than normal and coordinates effectoors to initiate responses that reduce heat gain and increase heat loss.

##### Effectors
- <span style="color: skyblue">Arterioles</span> near the skin surface (for vasoconstriction)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Sweat glands</span> (for sweating)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Erector muscles</span> (for reducing heat loss by contraction)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Skeletal muscles</span> (for shivering to generate heat)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Thyroid gland</span> (controls metabolic rate)

#### Regulation by the skin
1. Body temperature becomes <u>lower / higher than normal</u> as it loses heat more quickly to the surroundings.

2. The heat gain / loss centre in the hypothalaumus is stimulated to send nerve impulses to initiate responses in the skin that reduce heat loss.

**Responses in the skin**:
- Vasoconstriction of arterioles near the skin surface
