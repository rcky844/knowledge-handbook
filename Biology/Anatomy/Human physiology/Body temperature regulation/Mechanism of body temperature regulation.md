*Pre-context: [[Homeostasis]]*

**Thermoregulation** is an example of [[Homeostasis]] in humans, and occurs through the [[Negative feedback mechanism]].

#### Components
##### Receptors
The **receptors** are <span style="color: skyblue">thermoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> and in the [[skin]].
- **In the hypothalamus**: Detect the temperature of the blood
- **In the skin**: Detect the temperature of the skin

##### Control centre
The **control centre** is the <span style="color: skyblue">thermoregulatory centre</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> of the brain.
- Monitors and controls the core body temperature.
- Receives nerve impulses from receptors about temperature changes.

**Division by functionality**:
- **Heat gain centre**: Stimulated when temperature is lower than normal and coordinates effectors to initiate responses that increase heat gain and reduce heat loss.
- **Heat loss centre**: Stimulated when temperature is higher than normal and coordinates effectoors to initiate responses that reduce heat gain and increase heat loss.

##### Effectors
- <span style="color: skyblue">Arterioles</span> near the skin surface (for vasoconstriction)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Sweat glands</span> (for sweating)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Erector muscles</span> (for reducing heat loss by contraction)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Skeletal muscles</span> (for shivering to generate heat)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Thyroid gland</span> (controls metabolic rate)

#### Regulation by the skin
1. Body temperature becomes <u>lower / higher than normal</u> as it loses heat more quickly to the surroundings.

2. The heat gain / loss centre in the hypothalaumus is stimulated to send nerve impulses to initiate responses in the skin that reduce / increase heat loss.

##### Responses to reduce heat loss
- **Vasoconstriction of arterioles** reduces blood flow to capillaries near the skin surface. More blood flows through the shunt vessel (which is deeper in the skin). Less heat is loss from the skin to surroundings by conduction, convection and radiation.

- **Sweat glands secrete less sweat**, and heat loss by evaporation is reduced.

- **Erector muscles contract and hairs become erect.**

> **Note**:
> - A layer of still air is trapped close to the skin surface for mammals with thick furs.
> - Air is a good insulator of heat, so heat loss from the skin by conduction and convection is prevented.

- In the <u>long term</u>, the **layer of subcutaneous fat becomes thicker** in cold conditions. Fat is a good insulator of heat, less heat is lost from the body by conduction and convection.

##### Responses to increase heat loss
- **Vasodilation of arterioles** increases blood flow to capillaries near the skin surface. More heat is loss from the skin to surroundings by conduction, convection and radiation.

- **Sweat glands secrete more sweat**, heat loss by evaporation is increased.

> **Note**:
> Like [[transpiration]], wind speed and relative humidity affects the rate of evaporation of sweat.

- **Erector muscles relax and hairs lie flat.**

> **Note**:
> - A thinner layer of still air is trapped close to the skin surface.
> - Insulation is reduced and more heat is lost from the skin by conduction and convection.

- In the <u>long term</u>, the **layer of subcutaneous fat becomes thinner** in hot conditions. This reduces the insulating effect.

#### Shivering
**Shivering** is brought about by [[Reflex actions|involuntary]] <u>muscles contractions</u>.
- A fall in temperature stimulates the heat gain centre in the hypothalamus to send more frequent nerve impulses to <span style="color: skyblue">skeletal muscles</span>, causing them to <u>contract in short bursts</u>.
- Contraction ([[Metabolism]]) of skeletal muscles generates extra heat from increased cellular [[Respiration]].

#### Hormone thyroxine
As a long-term response to cold conditions, the <span style="color: skyblue">thyroid gland</span> becomes active and secrete more **thyroxine**.

//TODO image of the gland

**Thyroxine** <span style="color: lightgreen">increases the metabolic rate of body cells</span> so that more heat is generated in the body.

##### Mechanism of secretion
Secretion of **thyroxine** is controlled by the <span style="color: violet">pituitary gland</span>, it is under the control of the <span style="color: skyblue">hypothalamus</span> and involves a [[Negative feedback mechanism]].

1. A lowered body temperature is detected by thermoreceptors in the hypothalamus.
2. The hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland to secrete a hormome.
3. The hormone stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete more thyroxine.
4. Thyroxine increases the metabolic rate of body cells. More heat is generated.

#### Regulation voluntary behaviours
**When feeling cold**:
- Put on more clothes to reduce heat loss.
- Consume hot food and hot drinks, or switch on a heater to increase heat gain.
- Do exercise to increase heat production by [[Metabolism]].

**When feeling hot**:
- Wear fewer and thinner clothes to reduce insulation.
- Seek shade from strong sunlight to reduce heat gain by radiation.
- Switch on a fan or an air-conditioner to generate wind, so heat loss by convection and evaporation of sweat can be increased.
