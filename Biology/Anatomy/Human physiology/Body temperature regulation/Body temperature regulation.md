Regulation of body temperature <u>provides an optimum temperature range</u> for [[Enzymes]] to work efficiently in [[Metabolism|metabolic reactions]], maintaining a <u>steady metabolic rate</u>.

**Thermoregulation** involves balancing heat gain and heat loss.
- The body gains most heat internally from metabolic reactions, especially from cellular [[Respiration]] in the liver and skeletal miscles.
- The body also gains heat from or loses heat to the environment by conduction, convection and radiation.
- The body also loses heat by the evaporation of sweat.
