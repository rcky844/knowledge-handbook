The **skin** is mainly responsible for <span style="color: lightgreen">thermoregulation</span> in humans.

**Functions**:
- Regulate body temperature
- For body defence (acts as a [[Physical barriers|physical barrier]])
- For sensation
- For excretion (through sweating)

#### Structure
//TODO image

##### Epidermis
**Innermost layer** (Malpighian layer):
- Contains actively dividing cells by [[mitotic cell division]] to produce new cells.
- Contains cells producing the pigment (melanin) which gives the skin its colour.
	- Melanin absorbs ultraviolet (UV) light to protect the tissues from damage.
- Produces [[Vitamins#Vitamin D|vitamin D]] in sunlight.

**Middle layer**:
- Contains living cells produced by the Malpighian layer.
- Contents of its cells are gradually replaced by the fibrous protein keratin as they are pushed towards the skin surface. Their nuclei then disappears and they die.

**Outermost layer** (cornified layer):
- Contains flattened, dead cells that are constantly shed and replaced by cells from inner layers.
- Serves as a [[Physical barriers|barrier]] preventing the invasion of pathogens and protects the body from minor mechanical injuries.
- Cells are waterproof and help minimize water loss from the skin surface.

##### Dermis
###### Hair follicles, hairs and erector muscles
**Hair follicles** are sac-like structures that extend from the epidermis to the dermis.
- **Hair root** is where a hair develops, it is at the base of the hair follicle.
- An **erector muscle** is attached to each hair follicle.

**Action of erector muscle**:
- Contraction of erector muscle causes the hair to become erect.
- Relaxation of erector muscle causes the hair to lie flat.

> [!note]
> The contraction of this muscle is an [[Reflex actions|involuntary action]].

###### Sebaceous glands
**Sebaceous glands** open into the hair follicles and produce <span style="color: skyblue">sebum</span> (oily secretion).

**Sebum** <u>keeps the skin soft and makes it waterproof</u>. Moreover, it is an <span style="color: skyblue">antiseptic</span> that can <u>inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi</u> on the skin.

###### Sweat glands
**Sweat glands** are glands that secrete <span style="color: skyblue">sweat</span>.

**Sweat** consist of water, minerals and metabolic wastes (e.g. urea).
- By sweating, sweat from each sweat gland passes along a <span style="color: skyblue">sweat duct</span> to the skin surface through a <span style="color: skyblue">sweat pore</span>.
- Evaporation of sweat <span style="color: lightgreen">helps cool the skin</span>.
- Sweating <span style="color: lightgreen">helps excrete metabolic wastes</span>.

###### Sensory receptors and nerves
**Sensory receptors** are present in the dermis to [[Irritability|detect stimuli]] (e.g. temperature, touch, pain).

**Sensory neurones** carry nerve impulses from the receptors to the CNS. Motor neurones carry nerve impulses from the CNS to the muscles and glands in the dermis.

###### Blood vessels
**General function**:
- Supply living cells in the skin with oxygen and nutrients, and remove carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes.

**Shunt vessels**:
- Connect arterioles and venules, allowing blood to bypass certain capillaries.
- Controlling the amount of blood flowing through the capillaries near the skin surface can control the heat loss from the skin.

##### Subcutaneous fat
A layer of **subcutaneous fat** lies underneath the dermis.
- Thickness of the layer varies among different regions of the body and individuals.
- Serves as an <span style="color: lightgreen">insulating layer</span> to <u>reduce heat loss</u>.
- Serves as a source of <span style="color: lightgreen">energy reserve</span>.
