**Osmoregulation** is the regulation of water content in the body. This keeps the [[Osmosis|water potential]] of the blood and tissue fluid constant, and maintains a stable environment for cells to function properly.

In humans, this is achieved by regulating the amount of water lost in urine produced by the kidneys.

> **Note**:
> - Water is lost in urine, sweat, exhaled air, faeces and through evaporation from the skin surface.

#### Structure of the urinary system
![[kidneys.webp|700]]

**Two kidneys**:
- Receives blood from the aorta through the <span style="color: skyblue">renal arteries</span> and return blood to the vena cava through the <span style="color: skyblue">renal veins</span>.
- Filters the blood to form urine and leads to <span style="color: lightgreen">osmoregulation and excretion</span>.

**Two ureter**:
- Connects the kidneys to the <span style="color: skyblue">urinary bladder</span>.

**Urinary bladder**:
- Muscular sac responsible for <span style="color: lightgreen">temporary storage of urine</span>.

**Urethra**:
- Two <span style="color: skyblue">sphincter muscles</span> are present to prevent urine from leaking out.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Urination</span> is the process that releases urine to the outside of the body.

Internal structure of the kidney ⤴️

##### Structure of a nephron
![[nephron.webp|600]]

**Nephrons** are responsible for filtering of blood and formation of urine.

**Blood vessels**:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Afferent arteriole</span> pump blood into the glomerulus (a network of capillaries).
- <span style="color: skyblue">Glomerulus</span> join to form an efferent arteriole leaving the Bowman's capsule.
- <span style="color: skyblue">Efferent arteriole</span> leads to another network of capillaries that wraps around the kidney tubule.

**Flow of fluid along the kidney tubule**:
Bowman's capsule → proximal convoluted tubule → loop of Henle → distal convoluted tubule → collecting duct

> **Note**:
> - All Bowman's capsules are found in the cortex of the kidney.
> - Collecting ducts drain their contents into the pelvis and then to the ureter.

#### Process of urine formation
- [[Ultrafiltration]]
- [[Reabsorption]]

#### Functions of kidneys
- [[Process of osmoregulation|Osmoregulation]]
- [[Excretion]]

#### Kidney failure and dialysis machines
*Main article: [[Dialysis machines]]*

**Kidney failure** occurs when the half of the kidney function is lost. It can be treated through <span style="color: violet">haemodialysis</span>.
