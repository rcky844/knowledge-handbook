**Osmoregulation** is controlled by a [[Negative feedback mechanism]]. This involves urine production, which is brought about by <span style="color: skyblue">antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</span>.

**Details of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)**:
- It is produced by the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> of the brain, and is stored and released by the <span style="color: violet">pituitary gland</span>.
- The amount of ADH released depends on the <u>changes in water potential of the blood</u> detected by <span style="color: violet">osmoreceptors</span> in the hypothalamus.
- It affects the <span style="color: lightgreen">permeability of the walls of the collecting duct</span> so that the <span style="color: lightgreen">proportion of water reabsorbed along the collecting duct increases</span>.

#### Fall in water potential of blood
- The <span style="color: violet">osmoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> detect a fall in water potential in blood, it signals the <span style="color: violet">pituitary gland</span> to <u>release more ADH</u>.
- The level of ADH in blood increases.
	- The <span style="color: lightgreen">walls of the collecting ducts to become more permeable to water</span>.
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen">larger proportion of water is reabsorbed</span> into the blood by [[osmosis]].
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen">smaller volume</span> of <span style="color: lightgreen">concentrated urine</span> is formed.
- The <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> stimulates the 'thirst centre' in the brain, so the person feel thirsty and drink water.
- The water potential of blood rises and returns to normal.

#### Rise in water potential of blood
- The <span style="color: violet">osmoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> detect a rise in water potential in blood, it signals the <span style="color: violet">pituitary gland</span> to <u>release less ADH</u>.
- The level of ADH in blood decreases.
	- The <span style="color: lightgreen">walls of the collecting ducts to become less permeable to water</span>.
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen">smaller proportion of water is reabsorbed</span> into the blood by [[osmosis]].
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen">larger volume</span> of <span style="color: lightgreen">dilute urine</span> is formed.
- The water potential of blood falls and returns to normal.
