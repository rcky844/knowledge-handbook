**Osmoregulation** is controlled by a [[negative feedback mechanism]]. This involves urine production, which is brought about by <span style="color: skyblue">antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</span>.

**Details of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)**:
- **Production**: Produced by the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> of the brain; Stored and released by the <span style="color: violet">pituitary gland</span>.
- **Release**: Amount of ADH released depends on the <u>changes in water potential of the blood</u> detected by <span style="color: violet">osmoreceptors</span> in the hypothalamus.
- **Effects**: <span style="color: lightgreen">Increases the permeability of the walls of the collecting duct</span> so that the <span style="color: lightgreen">proportion of water reabsorbed along the collecting duct increases</span>.
- **Goal**: Conserve water / Remove excess water

> **Note**:
> The release of ADH actually occurs continuously.

#### Fall in water potential of blood
- <span style="color: skyblue">Osmoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> detect a fall in water potential in blood, and <u>signals</u> the <span style="color: skyblue">pituitary gland</span> to <u>release more ADH</u>.
- The level of ADH in blood increases.
	- The <span style="color: lightgreen">walls of the collecting ducts become more permeable to water</span>.
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>larger proportion</u> of water is reabsorbed</span> into the blood by [[osmosis]].
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>smaller volume</u></span> of <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>concentrated</u> urine</span> is formed.
- The <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> <u>stimulates the 'thirst centre'</u> in the brain, so the person feel thirsty and drink water.
- The water potential of blood <u>rises</u> and returns to normal.

#### Rise in water potential of blood
- <span style="color: skyblue">Osmoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> detect a rise in water potential in blood, and <u>signals</u> the <span style="color: skyblue">pituitary gland</span> to <u>release less ADH</u>.
- The level of ADH in blood decreases.
	- The <span style="color: lightgreen">walls of the collecting ducts become less permeable to water</span>.
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>smaller proportion</u> of water is reabsorbed</span> into the blood by [[osmosis]].
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>larger volume</u></span> of <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>dilute</u> urine</span> is formed.
- The water potential of blood <u>falls</u> and returns to normal.
