**Dialysis machines** are used in patients with <u>kidney failures</u> to perform <span style="color: violet">haemodialysis</span>, which can <span style="color: lightgreen">remove wastes and excess salts</span> from the blood.

#### Design
- **Dialysis tubing is differentially permeable.**
  It has <span style="color: violet">small pores</span> that <span style="color: lightgreen">allow small molecules to pass through but blood cells and plasma proteins cannot</span>.

- **Composition of the dialysis fluid is similar to that of blood plasma.**
	- It has the <span style="color: aqua">same concentration of glucose, amino acids and salts as normal blood</span>, so there is <span style="color: lightgreen">no net flow of essential substances from the blood to the dialysis fluid</span> in order to <span style="color: violet">prevent the loss of essential substances</span>.
	- The water potential is the same as blood to <span style="color: violet">prevent water loss</span>.
	- The dialysis fluid is kept at the same temperature as blood (37Â°C) to <span style="color: violet">prevent heat loss</span>.
	- However, it <span style="color: aqua">does not contain urea</span> to allow urea to [[Diffusion|diffuse]] into the dialysis fluid along the concentration gradient.

- **Dialysis tubing is highly branched.** (similar to a capillary network)
  This <span style="color: lightgreen">increases the surface area</span> for rapid [[diffusion]] of urea out of the blood.

- **Dialysis fluid and blood flow in opposite directions.**
  This ensures there will be a difference in concentration in the whole length of the dialysis tubing, this <span style="color: lightgreen">maintains a steep concentration gradient</span> for rapid [[diffusion]], and ensures more urea is removed.

#### Limitations
- <span style="color: lightgreen">The amount of blood that can be drawn into the dialysis machine per unit time is limited</span>, each treatment may take 4-6 hours to remove most urea from blood.
- The treatment has to be <span style="color: lightgreen">repeated</span> 2-3 times a week as urea is <span style="color: orange">continuously produced by the liver</span>.

#### Nutrition considerations
- Eat foods with less proteins / less protein-rich foods
- Control of diet
