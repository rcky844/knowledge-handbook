**Dialysis machines** are used in patients with <u>kidney failures</u> to perform <span style="color: violet">haemodialysis</span>, which can <span style="color: lightgreen">remove wastes and excess salts</span> from the blood.

#### Design
- **Dialysis tubing is differentially permeable.**
  It has small pores that <u>allow small molecules to pass through but blood cells and plasma proteins cannot</u>.

- **Composition of the dialysis fluid is similar to that of blood plasma.**
	- It has the same concentration of glucose, amino acids and salts as normal blood, so there is no net flow of essential substances from the blood to the dialysis fluid.
	- The water potential is the same as blood to prevent water loss.
	- The dialysis fluid is kept at the same temperature as blood to prevent heat loss.
	- However, it has no urea to allow urea to [[Diffusion|diffuse]] into the dialysis fluid along the concentration gradient.

- **Dialysis tubing is highly branched.** (similar to a capillary network)
  This <u>increases the surface area</u> for rapid [[diffusion]] of urea out of the blood.

- **Dialysis fluid and blood flow in opposite directions.**
  This <u>maintains a steep concentration gradient</u> for rapid [[diffusion]].

> **Note**:
> - The amount of blood that can be drawn into the dialysis machine per unit time is limited, each treatment may take 4-6 hours to remove most urea from blood.
> - The treatment has to be repeated 2-3 times a week as urea is continuously produced by the liver.
