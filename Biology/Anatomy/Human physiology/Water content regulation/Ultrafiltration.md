**Ultrafiltration** takes place in the <span style="color: skyblue">glomerulus</span>.
- Capillary wall and wall of the Bowman's capsule serves as the filter.
- Blood inside the glomerulus is under high pressure due to the pumping action of the heart, which results in <span style="color: lightgreen">high hydrostatic pressure</span> in the glomerulus.
- <u>Water and other small molecules in the blood are forced out</u> through the walls of the glomerulus and the Bowman's capsule into the capsular space, forming the <span style="color: skyblue">glomerular filtrate</span>.
- <u>Blood cells and plasma proteins are absent</u> in the glomerular filtrate because they are <u>too large to pass through</u> the walls of the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule.

> **Note**: (on glomerular filtrate)
> - Composition of glomerular filtrate is similar to tissue fluid as they are both formed similarly.
> - About 20% of blood in the glomerulus is filtered and becomes the glomerular filtrate.

> **Diseases**:
> - <u>Proteinuria</u> â€” Urine contains excess proteins, usually caused by damaged glomerular capillaries or Bowman's capsule (which acts as filters). As useful proteins are lost, it may cause edema (build-up of fluid in the body's tissue, causing swelling).
