**Reabsorption** takes place at the <span style="color: skyblue">kidney tubule</span>. Useful substances are actively absorbed into the blood via capillaries, while water and urea are absorbed passively into blood.

| Substance | % reabsorbed | Mechanism |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Glucose | 100% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Amino acids | 100% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Salts | 80% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Water | 99% | [[Osmosis]] |
| Urea | 50% | [[Diffusion]] |

- <span style="color: violet">Glucose, amino acids and some salts</span> in the glomerular filtrate are reabsorbed into the blood by both [[Diffusion]] and [[Active transport]].

- The reabsorption of glucose, amino acids and salts causes the <span style="color: aqua">glomerular filtrate to become more dilute and its water potential increases</span>. Water in the filtrate moves into blood by [[Osmosis]] down a water potential gradient.
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">Amount of water reabsorbed is directly proportional to the amount of solutes reabsorbed.</span> Therefore, the <u>concentration</u> of the filtrate that arrives at the end of the first coiled tubule remains unchanged.

- Reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate <span style="color: lightgreen">raises the concentration of urea</span> (to become higher than in blood) along the tubule, resulting in passive reabsorption of urea into blood by [[Diffusion]].

> [!note]
> - Glucose and amino acids are soluble in water, as they can form extensive [[hydrogen bonds]] with water molecules.
> - Glucose and amino acids are completely (and only) reabsorbed in the first coiled tubule. Water, urea, and some salts are reabsorbed even in the collecting duct.
> - For sodium ions, they are always actively reabsorbed. Their presence in blood can affect the water potential of blood.

#### Structural adaptations
- **The first coiled tubule is long and highly coiled.**
  This <u>increases the surface area</u> and allows more time for reabsorption.

- **The inner wall of the first coiled tubule is lined with microvilli.**
  This <u>increases the surface area</u> for reabsorption.

- **The wall of the first coiled tubule is only one-cell thick.**
  This <u>shortens the distance</u> for reabsorption.

- **The tubules are close in contact with blood capillaries.**
  This <u>shortens the distance</u> for reabsorption.

- **The cells in the walls of the first coiled tubule contain numerous mitochondria.**
  This provides a lot of energy for [[Active transport]] of useful substances against a concentration gradient.

- **Each kidney tubule is richly supplied with blood capillaries.**
  As the reabsorbed substances are transported away quickly, <u>a steep concentration gradient is maintained</u> for rapid reabsorption of substances.

> [!note]
> The kidneys contain over a million nephrons, this makes the kidneys highly effective in filtering blood and reabsorption.
