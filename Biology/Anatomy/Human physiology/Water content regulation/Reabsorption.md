**Reabsorption** takes place at the <span style="color: skyblue">kidney tubule</span>. Useful substances are actively absorbed into the blood via capillaries, while water and urea are absorbed passively into blood.

| Substance | % reabsorbed | Mechanism |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Glucose | 100% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Amino acids | 100% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Salts | 80% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Water | 99% | [[Osmosis]] |
| Urea | 50% | [[Diffusion]] |
- The reabsorption of glucose and amino acids causes the <u>glomerular filtrate to become more dilute and its water potential increases</u>. Water in the filtrate move into blood by [[osmosis]] down a water potential gradient.
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">Amount of water reabsorbed is proportional to the amount of solutes reabsorbed.</span> The <u>concentration</u> of the filtrate that arrives at the end of the first coiled tubule remains unchanged.

- Reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate <u>raises the concentration of urea</u> (to become higher than blood), causing 50% of urea to be reabsorbed into blood by [[diffusion]].

//TODO improve

> **Note**:
> - Glucose and amino acids are soluble in water, as they can form extensive [[hydrogen bonds]] with water molecules.
> - Glucose and amino acids are completely reabsorbed in the first coiled tubule. Other substances are reabsorbed as they flow through the kidney tubule.
> - Salts may include sodium compounds.
> - In cases of [[diabetes mellitus]], the glucose concentration of the filtrate may be higher than is normal. The nephrons may fail to reabsorb all the glucose, they may be present in urine. 

#### Structural adaptations
- **The first coiled tubule is long and highly coiled.**
  This <u>increases the surface area</u> and allows more time for reabsorption.

- **The inner wall of the first coiled tubule is lined with microvilli.**
  This <u>increases the surface area</u> for reabsorption.

- **The wall of the first coiled tubule is only one-cell thick.**
  This <u>shortens the distance</u> for reabsorption of substances from the glomerular filtrate into the blood.

- **The tubules are close in contact with blood capillaries.**
  This <u>shortens the distance</u> for reabsorption of substances from the glomerular filtrate into the blood.

- **The cells in the walls of the first coiled tubule contain numerous mitochondria.**
  This provides a lot of energy for [[active transport]] of useful substances.

- **Each kidney tubule is richly supplied with blood capillaries.**
  This maintains a steep concentration gradient for rapid reabsorption of substances, as reabsorbed substances are transported away quickly.

> **Note**:
> The kidneys contain over a million nephrons, this makes the kidneys highly effective in filtering blood and reabsorption.
