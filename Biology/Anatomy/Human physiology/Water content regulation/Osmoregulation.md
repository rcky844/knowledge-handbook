**Osmoregulation** is the <span style="color: lightgreen">regulation of water content</span> in the body.

**Goals of osmoregulation**:
- Keeping the [[Osmosis|water potential]] of the blood and tissue fluid constant (water balance)
- Maintaining a stable environment for cells to function properly
↪️ Achieved by <span style="color: aqua">actively retaining or releasing water</span> in urine

#### Mechanism
**Osmoregulation** is controlled by a [[negative feedback mechanism]]. This involves urine production, which is brought about by <span style="color: skyblue">antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</span>.

**Details of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)**:
- **Production**: <span style="color: lightgreen">Produced</span> by the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> of the brain continuously
- **Release**: <span style="color: lightgreen">Stored and released</span> by the <span style="color: violet">pituitary gland</span>. Amount of ADH released depends on the <u>changes in water potential of blood</u> detected by <span style="color: violet">osmoreceptors</span> in the hypothalamus.
- **Effects**: <span style="color: lightgreen">Increases the permeability of the walls of the collecting duct</span> so that the <span style="color: lightgreen">proportion of water reabsorbed along the collecting duct increases</span>.
- **Goal**: Conserve water / Remove excess water

> [!note]
> The release of ADH actually occurs continuously.

##### Fall in water potential of blood
- <span style="color: skyblue">Osmoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> detect a fall in water potential in blood, and <u>signals</u> the <span style="color: skyblue">pituitary gland</span> to <u>release more ADH</u>.
- The level of ADH in blood increases.
	- The <span style="color: lightgreen">walls of the collecting ducts become more permeable to water</span>.
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>larger proportion</u> of water is reabsorbed</span> into the blood by [[Osmosis]].
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>smaller volume</u></span> of <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>concentrated</u> urine</span> is formed.
- The <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> <u>stimulates the 'thirst centre'</u> in the brain, so the person feel thirsty and drink water.
- The water potential of blood <u>rises</u> and returns to normal.

##### Rise in water potential of blood
- <span style="color: skyblue">Osmoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">hypothalamus</span> detect a rise in water potential in blood, and <u>signals</u> the <span style="color: skyblue">pituitary gland</span> to <u>release less ADH</u>.
- The level of ADH in blood decreases.
	- The <span style="color: lightgreen">walls of the collecting ducts become less permeable to water</span>.
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>smaller proportion</u> of water is reabsorbed</span> into the blood by [[Osmosis]].
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>larger volume</u></span> of <span style="color: lightgreen"><u>dilute</u> urine</span> is formed.
- The water potential of blood <u>falls</u> and returns to normal.

#### Water gain and loss

> [!tip] Processes for water gain and loss
> - **Water gain**: drinks, food, metabolism (e.g. respiration)
> - **Water loss**: exhaled air, sweat, urine, faeces
##### Changes in water potential
**Factors**:
- Direct gain/loss of water
- Production of metabolic wastes (e.g. urea) during [[Respiration]]
- Glucose level (e.g. absorption, [[diabetes mellitus]])
- Intake of minerals

> [!note]
> As part of <span style="color: lightgreen">osmoregulation</span>, small and soluble substances in blood are also [[Ultrafiltration|filtered]] and end up in the urine produced. This helps to achieve the <span style="color: aqua">salt and water balance</span> of the body.

**Effects**:
- *Regulation by ADH*
  Secretion of ADH is <span style="color: lightgreen">increased/decreased</span> in order to <span style="color: aqua">retain/release a larger amount of water in blood</span>.

- *Increased blood volume*
  When the water potential of the cells is higher than that of blood, there will be a net movement of water from body cells to blood by [[Osmosis]].

##### Intake of drinks
Consider two types of drinks: distilled water, mineralized water
- All drinks increases the volume of blood.
- Distilled water <span style="color: lightgreen">increases the water potential of blood</span>, this <span style="color: aqua">decreases the secretion of ADH to release water</span>.
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen">larger volume of dilute urine</span> is produced when taking in distilled water, and therefore it is <span style="color: violet">less effective in replenishing water loss / maintaining higher fluid content</span>.
- Mineralized water <span style="color: lightgreen">decreases the water potential of blood</span>, this <span style="color: aqua">increases the secretion of ADH to retain water</span>, while removing excess salts.
	- A <span style="color: lightgreen">smaller volume of concentrated urine</span> is produced when taking in mineralized water, and therefore it is <span style="color: violet">more effective in replenishing water loss / maintaining higher fluid content</span>.
