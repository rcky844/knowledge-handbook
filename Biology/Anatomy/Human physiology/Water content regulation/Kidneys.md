The **kidneys** make up the [[Urinary system]].
- Receives blood from the aorta through the <span style="color: skyblue">renal arteries</span> and return blood to the vena cava through the <span style="color: skyblue">renal veins</span>.
- Filters the blood to form urine and leads to <span style="color: lightgreen">osmoregulation and excretion</span>.

#### Structure of a nephron
![[nephron.webp|600]]

**Nephrons** are responsible for filtering of blood and formation of urine.

**Blood vessels**:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Afferent arteriole</span> pump blood into the glomerulus (a network of capillaries).
- <span style="color: skyblue">Glomerulus</span> join to form an efferent arteriole leaving the Bowman's capsule.
- <span style="color: skyblue">Efferent arteriole</span> leads to another network of capillaries that wraps around the kidney tubule.

**Flow of fluid along the kidney tubule**:
Bowman's capsule → proximal convoluted tubule → loop of Henle → distal convoluted tubule → collecting duct

> [!note]
> - All Bowman's capsules are found in the cortex of the kidney.
> - Collecting ducts drain their contents into the pelvis and then to the ureter.

#### Kidney failure and dialysis machines
*Main article: [[Dialysis machines]]*

**Kidney failure** occurs when the half of the kidney function is lost. It can be treated through <span style="color: violet">haemodialysis</span>.
