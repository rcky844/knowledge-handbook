**Osmoregulation** is the regulation of water content in the body. This keeps the [[Osmosis|water potential]] of the blood and tissue fluid constant, and maintains a stable environment for cells to function properly.

In humans, this is achieved by regulating the amount of water lost in urine. Urine is produced by the kidneys.

> **Note**:
> - Water is lost in urine, sweat, exhaled air, faeces and through evaporation from the skin surface.

#### Structure of the urinary system
![[kidneys.webp|700]]

**Two kidneys**:
- Receives blood from the aorta through the <span style="color: skyblue">renal arteries</span> and return blood to the vena cava through the <span style="color: skyblue">renal veins</span>.
- Filters the blood to form urine and leads to <span style="color: lightgreen">osmoregulation and excretion</span>.

**Two ureter**:
- Connects the kidneys to the <span style="color: skyblue">urinary bladder</span>.

**Urinary bladder**:
- Muscular sac responsible for <span style="color: lightgreen">temporary storage of urine</span>.

**Urethra**:
- Two <span style="color: skyblue">sphincter muscles</span> are present to prevent urine from leaking out.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Urination</span> is the process that releases urine to the outside of the body.

Internal structure of the kidney ⤴️

##### Structure of a nephron
![[nephron.webp|600]]

**Nephrons** are responsible for filtering of blood and formation of urine.

> **Note**:
> - All of the Bowman's capsules are found in the cortex of the kidney.
> - Collecting ducts drain their contents into the pelvis and then to the ureter.
> - Capillaries of each glomerulus network join to form an efferent arteriole which leaves the Bowman's capsule, which then leads to another network of capillaries that wraps around the kidney tubule.

Photomicrograph of kidney tissue ⤴️

**Flow of fluid along the kidney tubule**:
Bowman's capsule → proximal convoluted tubule → loop of Henle → distal convoluted tubule → collecting duct

#### Process of urine formation
##### Ultrafiltration
**Ultrafiltration** takes place in the <span style="color: skyblue">glomerulus</span>.
- Capillary wall and wall of the Bowman's capsule serves as the filter.
- Blood inside the glomerulus is under high pressure due to the pumping action of the heart, which results in <span style="color: lightgreen">high hydrostatic pressure</span> in the glomerulus.
- <u>Water and other small molecules in the blood are forced out</u> through the walls of the glomerulus and the Bowman's capsule into the capsular space, forming the <span style="color: skyblue">glomerular filtrate</span>.
- <u>Blood cells and plasma proteins are absent</u> in the glomerular filtrate because they are <u>too large to pass through</u> the walls of the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule.

> **Note**: (on glomerular filtrate)
> - Composition of glomerular filtrate is similar to tissue fluid as they are both formed similarly.
> - About 20% of blood in the glomerulus is filtered and becomes the glomerular filtrate.

> **Diseases**:
> - <u>Proteinuria</u> — Urine contains excess proteins, usually caused by damaged glomerular capillaries or Bowman's capsule (which acts as filters). As useful proteins are lost, it may cause edema (build-up of fluid in the body's tissue, causing swelling).

##### Reabsorption
**Reabsorption** takes place at the <span style="color: skyblue">kidney tubule</span>. Useful substances are actively absorbed into the blood, while water and urea are absorbed passively into blood.

| Substance | % reabsorbed | Mechanism |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Glucose | 100% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Amino acids | 100% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Salts | 80% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Water | 99% | [[Osmosis]] |
| Urea | 50% | [[Diffusion]] |
- As glucose and amino acids are reabsorbed, the <u>glomerular becomes more dilute and its water potential increases</u>. This causes water in the filtrate to move into blood by [[osmosis]] down a water potential gradient.
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">Amount of water reabsorbed is proportional to the amount of solutes reabsorbed.</span> The <u>concentration</u> of the filtrate that arrives at the end of the first coiled tubule remains unchanged.
	  ↪️ See also: HKDSE 2017 Paper 2 Q1(b)(i)

- Reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate <u>raises the concentration of urea</u> (higher than blood), causing 50% of urea to be reabsorbed into blood by [[diffusion]].

> **Note**:
> - Glucose and amino acids are soluble in water, as they can form extensive [[hydrogen bonds]] with water molecules.
> - Glucose and amino acids are only reabsorbed in the first coiled tubule. Other substances are reabsorbed as they flow through the kidney tubule.
> - Salts may include sodium compounds.
> - In cases of [[diabetes mellitus]], the glucose concentration of the filtrate may be higher than is normal.

##### Structural adaptations for reabsorption
- **The first coiled tubule is long and highly coiled.**
  This <u>increases the surface area</u> and allows more time for reabsorption.

- **The inner wall of the first coiled tubule is lined with microvilli.**
  This <u>increases the surface area</u> and allows more time for reabsorption.

- **The wall of the first coiled tubule is only one-cell thick.**
  This <u>shortens the distance</u> for reabsorption of substances from the glomerular filtrate into the blood.

- **The tubules are close in contact with blood capillaries.**
  This <u>shortens the distance</u> for reabsorption of substances from the glomerular filtrate into the blood.

- **The cells in the walls of the first coiled tubule contain numerous mitochondria.**
  This provides a lot of energy for [[active transport]] of useful substances.

- **Each kidney tubule is richly supplied with blood capillaries.**
		  This maintains a steep concentration gradient for rapid reabsorption of substances, as reabsorbed substances are transported away quickly.

//TODO think about numerous nephrons in kidneys (rare tho)
