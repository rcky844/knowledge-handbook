*Importance of regulating gas content in blood*:
- Cells take up oxygen from blood continuously for [[respiration]] to release energy.
- Carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product of [[respiration]], and it dissolved in blood plasma to form weak acids, which <u>lowers the pH of blood</u>.
- [[Effects of pH level on enzymatic reactions|Enzyme activity]] and thus the metabolic rate is affected by change in pH.

*Determination of gas content in blood*:
- **Respiration rate** — intensity of physical activity
- **Ventilation rate** — rate and depth of breathing
- **Circulation of blood** — rate and strength of heartbeat
