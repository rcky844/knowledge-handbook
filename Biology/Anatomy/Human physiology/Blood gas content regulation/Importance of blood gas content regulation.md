**Importance of regulating gas content in blood**:
- Cells take up oxygen from blood continuously for [[Respiration]] to release energy.
- Carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product of [[Respiration]], and it dissolved in blood plasma to form weak acids, which <u>lowers the pH of blood</u>.
- [[Effects of pH level on enzymatic reactions|Enzymatic activity]] and thus the metabolic rate is affected by change in pH.

**Determination of gas content in blood**:
- **Respiration rate** — intensity of physical activity
- **Ventilation rate** — rate and depth of breathing
- **Circulation of blood** — rate and strength of heartbeat
