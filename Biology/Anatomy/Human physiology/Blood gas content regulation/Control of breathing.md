*Pre-context: [[Breathing system]]*

**Breathing** is under both [[Voluntary actions|voluntary]] and [[Reflex actions|involuntary]] control.
- It is voluntarily controlled by the [[Central nervous system#Cerebrum|cerebrum]].
- It is involuntarily controlled by the [[Central nervous system#Medulla oblongata (Medulla)|medulla oblongata]].
	- Sets the basic rhythm of breathing.
	- Adjusts the rate and depth of breathing.

**Calculating ventilation rate**:
$\text{Ventilation rate (mL / min)} = \text{Breathing rate (breaths / min)} \times \text{Tidal volume (mL)}$

#### Setting basic breathing rhythm
**Basic rhythm** is controlled by the respiratory centre of the <span style="color: skyblue">medulla oblongata</span>.

**Cycle of inhalation and exhalation**:
- **Initiation of inhalation**
  Respiratory centre sends nerve impulses to the intercostal muscles and diaphragm muscle to stimulate them to contract.

- **Stimulation of stretch receptors**
  Stretch receptors send nerve impulses to inhibit the respiratory centre, so it stops sending nerve impulses to the respiratory centre. The muscles would therefore relax to cause the lung to deflate and exhalation.

#### Adjusting rate and depth of breathing
The **rate and depth of breathing** is affected by the <span style="color: lightgreen">concentration of carbon dioxide in blood</span>. Chemoreceptors detect changes in pH of the blood and send nerve impulses to the respiratory centre. It is controlled by a [[negative feedback mechanism]].

> **Note**:
> Carbon dioxide can dissolve in blood and undergo the following reaction:
> $\ce{CO2 + H2O <=> H+ + HCO3-}$

**Location of chemoreceptors**:
- Respiratory centre in medulla oblongata
- Carotid bodies in the walls of the carotid arteries in the neck
- Aortic bodies in the wall of the aorta

**Process of regulation**:
1. A <u>rise / fall</u> in blood $\ce{CO2}$ concentration results in a fall in blood pH.
2. <span style="color: skyblue">Chemoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">carotid bodies</span> and <span style="color: violet">aortic bodies</span> detect a <u>fall / rise</u> in blood pH, and send nerve impulses to the respiratory centre.
3. <span style="color: skyblue">Chemoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">respiratory centre</span> is detect a <u>fall / rise</u> in blood pH.
4. The respiratory centre sends <u>more / fewer</u> nerve impulses (via a sympathetic nerve) to the intercostal muscles and diaphragm muscle, causing them to contract <u>more / less</u> frequently and forcefully.
5. The rate and depth of breathing <u>increase / decreases</U>. $\ce{CO2}$ is removed from the body at a <u>faster / slower</u> rate.
