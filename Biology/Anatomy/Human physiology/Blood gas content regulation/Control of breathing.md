*Pre-context: [[Breathing system]]*

**Breathing** is under both [[Voluntary actions|voluntary]] and [[Reflex actions|involuntary]] control.

**Control of breathing by the nervous system**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Voluntarily controlled</span> by the [[Central nervous system#Cerebrum|cerebrum]].
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Involuntarily controlled</span> by the [[Central nervous system#Medulla oblongata (Medulla)|medulla oblongata]].
	- Sets the <span style="color: violet">basic rhythm</span> of breathing.
	- Adjusts the <span style="color: violet">rate and depth of breathing</span>.
  ↪️ **Example**: during sleeping

#### Ventilation rate
**Ventilation rate** is the volume of air breathed in and out per minute.

**Calculation**:
$\text{Ventilation rate (mL / min)} = \text{Breathing rate (breaths / min)} \times \text{Tidal volume (mL)}$

#### Setting basic breathing rhythm
**Basic rhythm** is controlled by the respiratory centre of the <span style="color: skyblue">medulla oblongata</span>.

//TODO images

**Cycle of inhalation and exhalation**:
- **Initiation of inhalation**
  Respiratory centre sends nerve impulses to the intercostal muscles and diaphragm muscle to stimulate them to contract, and the lung inflate and inhalation occurs.

- **Stimulation of stretch receptors**
  <span style="color: skyblue">Stretch receptors</span> send nerve impulses to inhibit the respiratory centre, so it stops sending nerve impulses to the respiratory centre. The muscles would relax, and the lung to deflate and exhalation occurs.

#### Adjusting rate and depth of breathing
The **rate and depth of breathing** is affected by the <span style="color: lightgreen">concentration of carbon dioxide in blood</span>. Chemoreceptors detect changes in pH of the blood and send nerve impulses to the respiratory centre. It is controlled by a [[negative feedback mechanism]].

> [!note]
> Carbon dioxide can dissolve in blood and undergo the following reaction:
> $\ce{CO2 + H2O <=> H+ + HCO3-}$
> ↪️ See also: [[Transport of respiratory gases#Carbon dioxide]]

//TODO add reason for measuring conc. of hco3 instead of o2
//TODO add reason for locations of chemoreceptors
//TODO images
//TODO goal of the regulation
//TODO consider set point
//TODO consider sympathetic nerve and parasympathetic nerve

**Location of chemoreceptors**:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Respiratory centre</span> in [[Central nervous system#Medulla oblongata (Medulla)|medulla oblongata]]
- <span style="color: skyblue">Carotid bodies</span> in the walls of the carotid arteries in the neck
- <span style="color: skyblue">Aortic bodies</span> in the wall of the aorta (aotric arch)

**Process of regulation**:
1. A <u>rise / fall</u> in blood $\ce{CO2}$ concentration results in a fall in blood pH.
2. <span style="color: skyblue">Chemoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">carotid bodies</span> and <span style="color: violet">aortic bodies</span> detect a <u>fall / rise</u> in blood pH, and send nerve impulses to the respiratory centre.
3. <span style="color: skyblue">Chemoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">respiratory centre</span> is detect a <u>fall / rise</u> in blood (/ cerebrospinal fluid) pH.
4. The respiratory centre sends <span style="color: lightgreen">more / fewer</span> nerve impulses (via a sympathetic nerve) to the intercostal muscles and diaphragm muscle, causing them to contract <span style="color: lightgreen">more / less</span> frequently and forcefully.
5. The rate and depth of breathing <u>increase / decreases</U>. $\ce{CO2}$ is removed from the body at a <u>faster / slower</u> rate.
