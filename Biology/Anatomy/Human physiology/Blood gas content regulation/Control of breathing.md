*Pre-context: [[Breathing system]]*

**Breathing** is under both [[Voluntary actions|voluntary]] and [[Reflex actions|involuntary]] control.

**Control of breathing by the nervous system**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Voluntarily controlled</span> by the [[Central nervous system#Cerebrum|cerebrum]].
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Involuntarily controlled</span> by the [[Central nervous system#Medulla oblongata (Medulla)|medulla oblongata]].
	- Sets the <span style="color: violet">basic rhythm</span> of breathing.
	- Adjusts the <span style="color: violet">rate and depth of breathing</span>.

#### Ventilation rate
*Pre-context*: [[Mechanism of ventilation]]

**Ventilation rate** is the volume of air breathed in and out per minute.

| **Ventilation rate** |  =  | **Breathing rate** |  ×  | **Tidal volume** |
| :------------------: | :-: | :----------------: | :-: | :--------------: |
|      (mL / min)      |     |  (breaths / min)   |     |       (mL)       |

> [!tip] Tidal volume and breathing rate
> - **Tidal volume** is the volume of air that moved through the lungs in each inhalation and exhalation <u>during resting</u>.
> - Only the cycles where there are <u>no major fluctuations</u> should be measured in the breathing rate.
> - A <span style="color: violet">spirometer</span> is used to determine the vital capacity of a person.

> [!tip] Calculation by graph
> ![[ventilation_rate_graph.webp|600]]
> From the graph:
> - Breathing rate = $2.5 / {6\over60}$ = 25 breaths / min
> - Tidal volume = $\pu{500 mL}$

#### Setting basic breathing rhythm
**Basic rhythm** is controlled by the <span style="color: violet">respiratory centre</span> of the <span style="color: skyblue">medulla oblongata</span>.

**Cycle of inhalation and exhalation**: [[Breathing rhythm.canvas|See diagram]]
- **Initiation of inhalation**
  <span style="color: skyblue">Respiratory centre</span> sends nerve impulses to the <span style="color: violet">intercostal muscles and diaphragm muscle</span> to stimulate them to contract, and the lung inflate and inhalation occurs.

- **Stimulation of stretch receptors**
  <span style="color: skyblue">Stretch receptors</span> send nerve impulses to inhibit the respiratory centre, so it stops sending nerve impulses to the respiratory centre. The muscles would relax, and the lung to deflate and exhalation occurs.

#### Adjusting rate and depth of breathing
The **rate and depth of breathing** is affected by the <span style="color: lightgreen">concentration of carbon dioxide in blood</span>. <span style="color: skyblue">Chemoreceptors</span> <span style="color: violet">detect changes in pH of the blood and send nerve impulses to the respiratory centre</span>. It is controlled by a [[negative feedback mechanism]].

> [!tip] Detection by chemoreceptors
> Respiration consumes $\ce{O2}$ and produces $\ce{CO2}$ simultaneously, so the rate of consumption of $\ce{O2}$ is directly proportional to the rate of production of $\ce{CO2}$.
> 
> Moreover, carbon dioxide can dissolve in blood and undergo the following reaction: $\ce{CO2 + H2O <=> H+ + HCO3-}$
> ↪️ See also: [[Transport of respiratory gases#Carbon dioxide]]
> 
> Therefore, the conc. of $\ce{O2}$ can be deduced from the change in pH caused by production of bicarbonate ions.

**Location of chemoreceptors**:
![[chemoreceptors_location.webp|400]]
- <span style="color: skyblue">Respiratory centre</span> in [[Central nervous system#Medulla oblongata (Medulla)|medulla oblongata]]
- <span style="color: skyblue">Carotid bodies</span> in the walls of the carotid arteries in the neck
- <span style="color: skyblue">Aortic bodies</span> in the wall of the aorta (aortic arch)

**Process of regulation**: [[Breathing rate and depth.canvas|See diagram]]
1. A <u>rise / fall</u> in blood $\ce{CO2}$ concentration results in a fall in blood pH.
2. <span style="color: skyblue">Chemoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">carotid bodies</span> and <span style="color: violet">aortic bodies</span> detect a <u>fall / rise</u> in blood pH, and send nerve impulses to the respiratory centre.
3. <span style="color: skyblue">Chemoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: violet">respiratory centre</span> is detect a <u>fall / rise</u> in blood (/ cerebrospinal fluid) pH.
4. The respiratory centre sends <span style="color: lightgreen">more / fewer</span> nerve impulses (via a sympathetic nerve) to the intercostal muscles and diaphragm muscle, causing them to contract <span style="color: lightgreen">more / less</span> frequently and forcefully.
5. The rate and depth of breathing <u>increase / decreases</U>. $\ce{CO2}$ is removed from the body at a <u>faster / slower</u> rate.
