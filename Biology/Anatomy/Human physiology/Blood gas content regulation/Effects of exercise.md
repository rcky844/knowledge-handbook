#### Rate and depth of breathing
*Pre-context: [[Control of breathing]]*

**Effects of exercise**:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Skeletal muscles</span> <span style="color: lightgreen">contract more vigorously</span>.
- Energy demand is increases.
- More oxygen is needed to carry out [[aerobic respiration]] at a faster rate.
- Carbon dioxide is produced at a faster rate.

##### During exercise
**Response to exercise**:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Respiratory centre</span> (in the <span style="color: violet">medulla</span>) is stimulated to send more nerve impulses through the sympathetic nerve to the respiratory muscles to <span style="color: lightgreen">increase ventilation rate</span>.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">More oxygen can be breathed in per unit time</span>, oxygen concentration in air sacs increases. A <span style="color: aqua">steep concentration gradient</span> of oxygen between the air inside the air sacs and the blood in the capillaries can be maintained so <span style="color: aqua">oxygen diffuses into the blood more rapidly</span>.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Carbon dioxide can also be breathed out more quickly</span>, thus a steep concentration gradient of carbon dioxide between the blood and air sacs is maintained for the rapid removal of carbon dioxide by [[diffusion]].

**Response to strenuous exercises**:
- As the intensity of physical activity increases, the energy demand of muscle cells increases greatly. The rate of [[aerobic respiration]] is limited by the availability of oxygen and may not be fast enough to provide sufficient energy to satisfy the energy demand.
- Skeletal muscles cells would also undergo [[anaerobic respiration]] to produce extra energy to supply the immediate energy need. Lactic acid is produced as a by-product, accumulation of the acid in skeletal muscles gradually prevents the muscles from contracting normally and they begin to work inefficiently (muscle fatigue).

##### After exercise
- Ventilation rate remains high for some time after exercise ends, gas exchange occurs at a faster rate.
- This provides more oxygen for the [[Lactate fermentation|metabolism of lactic acid]] in the liver (to pay the <span style="color: skyblue">oxygen debt</span>).

#### Cardiac output
*Pre-context: [[Control of heartbeat]]*

**Reason for increased cardiac output**:
- **Supply oxygen and glucose to skeletal muscle cells more rapidly.**
  This allows the cells to carry out [[aerobic respiration]] at a faster rate re;ease more energy for muscle contractions.

- **Remove carbon dioxide and lactic acid from skeletal muscle cells more rapidly.**
  This prevents the accumulation of carbon dioxide and lactic acid in the muscles, which lowers the pH of the blood and affects enzymatic reactions.

- **Remove heat from skeletal muscles and cardiac muscle.**
  This prevents muscles from overheating.

**Actions to increase cardiac output**:
- Cardiovascular centre is stimulated.
