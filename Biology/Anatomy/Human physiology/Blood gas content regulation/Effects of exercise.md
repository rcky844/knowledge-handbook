#### Rate and depth of breathing
*Pre-context: [[Control of breathing]]*

##### During exercise
**Explaining effects on blood gas content**:
- Skeletal muscles contract more vigorously, and need more oxygen to carry out aerobic [[respiration]] at a faster rate, energy demand is increased.
- Carbon dioxide is produced at a faster rate.

**Response to exercise**:
- Respiratory centre (in the medulla) is stimulated to send more nerve impulses through the sympathetic nerve to the respiratory muscles to increase ventilation rate.
- More oxygen can be breathed in per unit time, oxygen concentration in air sacs increases. A steep concentration gradient of oxygen between the air inside the air sacs and the blood in the capillaries can be maintained, so oxygen diffuses into the blood more rapidly.
- Carbon dioxide can also be breathed out more quickly, thus a steep concentration gradient of carbon dioxide between the blood and air sacs is maintained for the rapid removal of carbon dioxide by [[diffusion]].

**Response to strenuous exercises**:
- As the intensity of physical activity increases, the energy demand of muscle cells increases greatly. The rate of [[aerobic respiration]] is limited by the availability of oxygen and may not be fast enough to provide sufficient energy to satisfy the energy demand.
- Skeletal muscles cells would also undergo [[anaerobic respiration]] to produce extra energy to supply the immediate energy need. Lactic acid is produced as a by-product, accumulation of the acid in skeletal muscles gradually prevents the muscles from contracting normally and they begin to work inefficiently (muscle fatigue).
