*Pre-context: [[Circulatory system]] / [[Heart]]*

**Heartbeat** is under [[Reflex actions|involuntary]] control.

#### Initiation of heartbeat
![[heart_adv.webp|500]]

Control of the basic heartbeat is <span style="color: lightgreen">myogenic</span>, which means the <u>heart will beat without any external stimulus</u> (it is imitated within the muscle itself).

**Components**:
- The **heart** is composed mainly of <span style="color: skyblue">cardiac muscles</span>. They can <u>contract upon stimulation by electrical impulses generated by the cardiac muscle itself</u>.
- The **sinoatrial (SA) node** (group of specialized cardiac muscle cells) is known as a <span style="color: skyblue">pacemaker</span> that <u>provides the initial stimulus for a heartbeat</u>.

**Process**:
1. **Electrical impulse generation by SA node & Contraction of atria**
	- Electrical impulse is generated by the SA node, which <span style="color: lightgreen">spreads rapidly through the walls of both atria</span>, causing <span style="color: aqua">both atria to contract at the same time</span>.

2. **Electrical impulse relay at AV node**
	- The electrical impulses pass to the AV node (a relay point) between the right atrium and the right ventricle.
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">AV node relays the electrical impulses</span> along the septum to the base of the ventricles through the bundle of His (specialized muscle fibres).
	- The electrical impulses are <span style="color: violet">delayed for ~0.1 second</span> to <span style="color: aqua">allow time for the ventricles to fill with blood</span>.

3. **Contraction of ventricles
	- As the electrical impulses spread upwards through the wall of the ventricles, the ventricles contract from the bottom up to <u>squeeze blood upwards into the aorta and pulmonary arteries</u>.

> [!note]
> The inner walls of the ventricles contain specialized conducting fibres which spread the electrical impulses.

#### Major events in a cardiac cycle
A **cardiac cycle** is a sequence of evens starting from one contraction of the atria to the next.

> [!note]
> The human heart beats 72 times per minute on average, with each cardiac cycle lasting ~0.8 seconds.

1. **Atrial systole** <span style="color: lightgreen">(contraction of the atria)</span>
   ($\pu{0 - 0.1s}$)
	- SA node generates electrical impulses.
	- Atria contract and ventricles relax.
	- Blood pressure in atria becomes higher than that in the ventricles.
	- Bicuspid and tricuspid valves open. Blood is forced from the atria into the ventricles through bicuspid and tricuspid valves.

2. **Ventricular systole** <span style="color: lightgreen">(contraction of the ventricles)</span>
   ($\pu{0.1 - 0.4s}$)
	- AV node relays electrical impulses.
	- Ventricles contract and atria relax.
	- Blood pressure in ventricles becomes higher than that in the atria.
	- Bicuspid and tricuspid valves are forced to close. This prevents the backflow of blood into the atria.
	- Semilunar valves open. Blood is forced into the aorta and the pulmonary artery through the semilunar valves.

> [!note]
> The closure of bicuspid and tricuspid valves produces the first heart sound ('lub').

3. **Diastole** <span style="color: lightgreen">(relaxation)</span>
   ($\pu{0.4 - 0.8s}$)
	 - Both the ventricles and atria relax.
	 - Blood pressure in ventricles and atria fall. The blood pressure in atria is higher than that in ventricles.
	 - Bicuspid and tricuspid valves open. Blood from the vena cava and pulmonary vein is allowed to flow into the atria. (as the pressure in the atria is lower)
	 - Semilunar valves close. This prevents the backflow of blood from the two blood vessels into the ventricles.

> [!note]
> The closure of semilunar valves process produces the second heart sound ('dub').

#### Cardiac output
**Cardiac output** is the total volume of blood pumped by each ventricle per minute.

| **Cardiac output** |  =  | **Heart rate** |  ×  | **Stroke volume** |
| :----------------: | :-: | :------------: | :-: | :---------------: |
|     (mL / min)     |     | (beats / min)  |     |    (mL / beat)    |
- **Heart rate**: Numbers of heartbeats per minute
- **Stroke volume**: Volume of blood pumped by each ventricle in one heartbeat

**Factors affecting stroke volume**:
- **Venous return** (volume of blood returning to the heart from the vena cava)
  It limits the volume of blood available in the <span style="color: skyblue">left ventricle</span>.

- **Strength of ventricular contraction**
  It determines the maximum volume of blood pumped out of the heart in each heartbeat.

##### Nervous control
**Factors influencing control of cardiac output**:
- **Blood pH** (concentration of $\ce{CO2}$ in blood)
  Changes in blood pH are detected by <span style="color: skyblue">chemoreceptors</span> in the <span style="color: orange">carotid and aortic bodies</span> which send nerve impulses to the <span style="color: violet">cardiovascular centre</span>.

> [!note]
> Chemoreceptors can also detect the pH level (i.e. $\ce{CO2}$ concentration) of the cerebrospinal fluid.

- **Blood pressure**
  <span style="color: skyblue">Stretch receptors</span> in the walls of <span style="color: violet">vena cava, carotid arteries and the aorta</span> are sensitive to stretching of blood vessels caused by increased blood flow.

- **Movement of limbs**
  This stimulates <span style="color: skyblue">stretch receptors</span> in muscles and tendons.

**Mechanism of control**:
- Receptors send nerve impulses to the <span style="color: skyblue">cardiovascular centre</span> in the [[Central nervous system#Medulla oblongata (Medulla)|medulla oblongata]].
- <span style="color: skyblue">Cardiovascular centre</span> processes the information and send nerve impulses to SA node via a <span style="color: violet">sympathetic nerve</span> and the <span style="color: violet">vagus nerve</span> (parasympathetic nerve) to regulate cardiac output.
	- These nerves are <span style="color: lightgreen">antagonistic</span> in action: <span style="color: violet">sympathetic nerve</span> stimulates the SA node, increasing cardiac output; <span style="color: violet">vagus nerve</span> inhibits SA node, decreasing cardiac output.
	- When resting, <span style="color: violet">vagus nerve</span> is more active than the <span style="color: violet">sympathetic nerve</span>.
	  During exercise or in stressful situations, <span style="color: violet">sympathetic nerve</span> will be more active.

**Control by cardiovascular centre**:
- When **more nerve impulses** is sent via the sympathetic nerve to stimulate the SA node and the cardiac muscle:
	- The <span style="color: skyblue">cardiac muscle</span> <span style="color: lightgreen">contracts more frequently and forcefully</span>.
	- The <span style="color: skyblue">heart rate and stroke volume</span> is <span style="color: lightgreen">increased</span>.
	- Cardiac output is increased.
- When **less nerve impulses** is sent via the sympathetic nerve to stimulate the SA node and the cardiac muscle:
	- The <span style="color: skyblue">cardiac muscle</span> <span style="color: lightgreen">contracts less frequently and forcefully</span>.
	- The <span style="color: skyblue">heart rate and stroke volume</span> is <span style="color: lightgreen">decreased</span>.
	- Cardiac output is decreased.

> [!note]
> When more nerve impulses are sent through the vagus nerve, fewer nerve impulses (<span style="color: lightgreen">but not none</span>) are sent through the sympathetic nerve.

##### Hormonal control
During <u>exercise or in stressful situations</u>, the <span style="color: skyblue">cardiovascular centre</span> sends nerve impulses via the <span style="color: aqua">sympathetic nerve</span> to the [[Endocrine system|adrenal glands]], causing them to secrete more <span style="color: violet">adrenaline</span> into the blood.

**Action of adrenaline**:
- Stimulates <span style="color: skyblue">SA node and cardiac muscles</span>;
- Causes cardiac muscles to contract more frequently and forcefully;
- The heart rate and stroke volume is increased;
- Cardiac output is increased.
