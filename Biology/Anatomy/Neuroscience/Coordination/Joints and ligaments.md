A **joint** is the junction where two or more bones meet. There are two types of joints:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Movable joints (synovial joints)</span> allows movement.
  (e.g. joints of shoulder, hips, knees, elbows, fingers and toes)
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Immovable joints</span> (e.g. joints between the bones of the cranium)

#### Structure of a movable joint
![[movable_joint.webp|500]]

A **movable joint** is held together by tough and elastic ligaments that forms the fibrous capsule enclosing the joint.
- The end surfaces of the bone are covered with cartilage.
- The inner surface of the fibrous capsule is lined by a synovial membrane that secretes synovial fluid into the synovial cavity.

**Functions of ligaments**:
- Allow the bones to move (→ Elastic)
- Hold the bones in position (→ Tough)
- Prevent dislocation of the joint during movement (→ Tough)

**Functions of cartilage**:
- Acts as a shock absorber.
- Reduces friction between the bones during movement.
- Prevents wearing of bones at the joints during movement.

**Functions of synovial fluid**:
- Serves as a lubricant to reduce friction between the bones during movement.
- Supplies oxygen and nutrients to the cartilage.

##### Types of movable joints
###### Hinge joint
| ![[hinge_joint.webp\|200]] | ![[hinge_joint_egs.webp\|400]] |
| :--: | :--: |
The convex surfaces of one bone fits into the concave surface of another bone. This allows movement in one plane only.

###### Ball-and-socket joint
| ![[ball_and_socket_joint.webp\|180]] | ![[ball_and_socket_joint_egs.webp\|300]] |
| :--: | :--: |
One of the bones has a rounded head (ball) and the other bone has a cup-like depression (socket). This allows movement in many plants (almost all directions).
