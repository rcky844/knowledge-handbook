The **endocrine system** is responsible for <span style="color: lightgreen">hormonal coordination</span>. It consists of a number of endocrine glands secreting hormones to coordinate many physiological processes in the body.

![[endocrine_glands.webp|400]]

**Endocrine glands** are ductless glands and secrete hormones directly into blood vessels. Inside of these glands, hormone-secreting cells release hormones. After it diffuses into the bloodstream, <u>it travels throughout the body to target organs</u>.

Below lists some examples of endocrine glands:

| Hormone | Endocrine gland | Functions of the hormone |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Growth hormone (GH) <td style="text-align: center" rowspan="4">Pituitary gland</td> | Stimulates growth of skeletal muscles and bones |
| Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) | Regulates the water content of the blood |
| Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) | Stimulates ovum development and oestrogen secretion in females |
| Luteinising hormone (LH) | Stimulates ovulation in females |
| Thyroxin | Thyroid gland | Regulates the metabolic rate |
| Insulin <td style="text-align: center" rowspan="2">Pancreas</td> | Lowers blood glucose |
| Glucagon | Raises blood glucose |
| Adrenaline | Adrenal gland | Prepares the body for physical activity or emergency |
| Oestrogen <td style="text-align: center" rowspan="2">Ovaries</td> | Stimulates the development of the female reproductive system and female secondary sexual characteristics |
| Progesterone | Regulates the menstrual cycle |
| Testosterone | Testes | Stimulates the development of the male reproductive system and male secondary sexual characteristics |

#### Nature
**Hormones** are chemical messengers that travel throughout the body in the bloodstream. They have the following properties:
- They are <span style="color: lightgreen">very specific</span> and will <u>only act on target organs</u> with cells that have specific receptor sites.
	- The hormone binds to the receptor sites of the target cells to produce specific responses.
	- Cells that lack receptor sites do not respond to the hormone.
- They are <span style="color: lightgreen">effective in very low concentrations</span>, but can have <u>widespread and long-lasting effects</u>.
	- The hormone may affect multiple organs situated far away from the gland that produce it.
