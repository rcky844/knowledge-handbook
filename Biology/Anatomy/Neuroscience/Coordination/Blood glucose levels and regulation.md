**Blood glucose levels** are regulated by a negative feedback mechanism through the actions of protein hormones insulin and glucagon, secreted by the pancreas.

The pancreas detect changes in blood glucose levels and control the secretion of these hormones. Glucose level is regulated at a set point of around 90 mg / 100 cm<sup>3</sup> of blood.

#### Insulin
**Insulin** is a protein hormone that has the following functions:
- Stimulates liver cells to convert more glucose to glycogen
- Stimulates body cells to take up more glucose from the blood
- Inhibits the secretion of glucagon.

Overall, insulin causes blood glucose level to decrease.

#### Glucagon
**Glucagon** is a protein hormone that stimulates liver cells to convert more glycogen to glucose.

Overall, glucagon causes blood glucose level to increase.
