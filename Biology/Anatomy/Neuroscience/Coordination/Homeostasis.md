**Homeostasis** is a self-regulating process by which body systems in an organism maintains a stable internal environment.

> **Note**:
> While the internal environment is maintained to be stable, it is not identical to being maintained to constant levels.

Changes in the internal environment are influenced by the external environment (e.g. air temperature) and body activities (e.g. feeding).

In humans, homeostasis refers to the immediate environment of cells (blood & tissue fluid). As cells are sensitive to changes in the environment surrounding them, homeostasis ensures that the cells may function properly.

#### Negative feedback mechanism
![[neg_fdback_sys.webp]]

In a **negative feedback system**, any changes in a parameter triggers a corrective response that has the opposed effect to bring the parameter back to normal (set point).

In humans, it operates with interactions of three components:
- **Receptors**: Detect changes in the internal environment
- **Control centre (nervous system / endocrine system)**:
  Receive information from the receptors and coordinates a response with reference to a set point.
- **Effectors**: Produce a response to reverse any changes in the internal environment

#### Parameters of the internal environment
##### Body temperature
![[homeo_body_temp.webp|500]]

- **Importance for keeping the parameter stable**:
  Maintains a stable optimal temperature for enzymes to work in metabolic reactions.

- **Effects of extreme conditions**:
  Enzymes become inactive at low temperatures, and they are denatured at high temperatures. Body metabolism will be affected, which may lead to death.

- **Organ(s) involved in homeostatic control**:
  [[Physical barriers#Skin|Skin]] — Helps regulate the body temperature at around 37°C

##### Water and salt content in the blood
![[homeo_water_salt.webp|350]]

- **Importance for keeping the parameter stable**:
  Maintains a stable water potential for blood and tissue fluid so that cells can function properly.

- **Effects of extreme conditions**:
  Differences in water potential of blood or tissue fluid surrounding the cells determine the net movement of water into and out of the cell by [[osmosis]].

- **Organ(s) involved in homeostatic control**:
  [[Kidneys]] — Filters the blood and removes excess water and salts from the body

##### Gas content in the blood
- **Importance** **for keeping the parameter stable**:
  Provides a sufficient supply of oxygen for cells to carry out respiration in order to obtain energy.
  Maintains a stable content of carbonic acid (carbon dioxide) in blood and tissue fluid for a stable pH.

- **Effects of extreme conditions**:
  Insufficient oxygen supply affects respiration and can damage nerve cells and the heart over time.
  A build-up of carbon dioxide would lower the pH (increase the acidity) of blood and tissue fluid, affecting enzyme activity in cells.

- **Organ involved in homeostatic control**:
  [[Lungs and associated structures|Lungs]] — Helps take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide
  [[Heart]] — Ensures adequate blood flow carrying oxygenated blood to all parts of the body

> **Note**:
> The lungs and the heart receive signals from the brain to change the breathing rate and heart rate when necessary.

##### Glucose level in the blood
Main article: [[Blood glucose levels and regulation]]

- **Importance** **for keeping the parameter stable**:
  Provides a sufficient supply of glucose for cells to carry out respiration in order to obtain energy.
  Maintains a stable water potential of blood and tissue fluid.

- **Effects of extreme conditions**:
  Glucose is the main respiratory substrate, inadequate supply affects respiration of cells and can damage nerve cells and the heart over time.
  Glucose is soluble in water and affects the water potential of the blood. Differences in water potential of blood or tissue fluid surrounding determine the net movement of water into and out of the cell by osmosis.

- **Organ involved in homeostatic control**:
	- Pancreas
	- Liver
