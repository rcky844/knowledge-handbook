A **neurone** consists of a cell body and two types of nerve fibres (dendrons and axons).

![[neurone.webp]]

The <span style="color: lightgreen">cell body</span> contains the nucleus and a variety of [[Sub-cellular structures in cells|organelles]].

The <span style="color: lightgreen">nerve fibres</span> are cytoplasmic processes (extensions) extending from the cell body.
- <span style="color: violet">Dendons</span> transmit nerve impulses <u>towards the cell body</u>.
  They can form branches called <span style="color: violet">dendrites</span> to receive information from a number of neurones.
- <span style="color: violet">Axons</span> transmit nerve impulses <u>away from the cell body</u>.

#### Adaptations for transmitting nerve impulses

- **A neurone has long nerve fibres.**
  This is to transmit nerve impulses over a long distance.

- **A dendron has many branches (dendrites).**
  This is to receive information from other neurones so that each neurone can communicate with many others.

- **Most nerve fibres are surrounded by a lipid covering called the myelin sheath.**
  This is to protect the nerve fibres, insulate the nerve fibres and prevent the loss of nerve impulses to the surroundings. It can also speed up the transmission of nerve impulses.

> **Note**:
> Nerve fibres surrounded by the myelin sheath is referred to as myelinated.

#### Types of neurones
![[neurones_type.webp]]

- **Sensory neurones**
  They transmit nerve impulses <u>from receptors to the CNS</u>.
  They have an <u>oval-shaped cell body lying outside the CNS</u>, with a <u>long dendron</u> and a <u>short axon</u>.

- **Motor neurones**
  They transmit nerve impulses <u>from the CNS to effectors</u> (e.g. muscles and glands).
  They have an <u>irregularly shaped cell body lying outside the CNS</u>, with a number of <u>very short dendrons</u> and <u>long axons</u>.

- **Interneurones**
  They transmit nerve impulses <u>within the CNS</u>.
  They have an <u>irregularly shaped cell body lying inside the CNS</u>, with <u>short dendrons</u> and <u>short axons</u>.
  
#### Structure of a nerve

![[nerve_photomicrograph.webp|200]]

- A nerve is made up of bundles of nerve fibres wrapped in tough connective tissue.
- Some nerves consists of nerve fibres of either sensory or motor neurones only.
  (e.g. <span style="color: violet">optic nerve</span> is a cranial nerve consisting of nerve fibres of sensory neurones only)
- However, spinal nerves consist of nerve fibres of both sensory and motor neurones.

#### Transmission of nerve impulses
A **synapse** is the junction between two neurones. Transmission of nerve impulses from one neurone to another is done by means of neurotransmitters.

![[synapse_transmission.webp]]

The <span style="color: lightgreen">synaptic knob</span> is a swollen structure located at the end of an axon. It has numerous mitochondria for energy production and contains <span style="color: violet">synaptic vesicles</span> which store chemicals called neurotransmitters.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">synaptic cleft</span> is a tiny gap that separates the neurones. There is no physical contact between neurones, nerve impulses cannot travel directly to the next neurone. There are also enzymes present at the synaptic cleft.

> **Note**:
> The enzymes at the synaptic cleft is specific in action and breaks down neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft.
> 
> This prevents repeated nerve impulses from being generated when the dendron is continuously stimulated.

##### Importance of synapses
- They ensure that nerve impulses are transmitted in one direction only (from the axon of one neurone to the dendron of the next neurone).
  Only synaptic knobs can secrete neurotransmitters and only dendrons passes the receptor sites for binding with neurotransmitters.

- They allow only one neurone to communicated with many other neurones to form neural networks. This allows complex coordination between receptors and effectors.
