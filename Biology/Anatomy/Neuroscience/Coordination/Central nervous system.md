#### Protective structures
![[cns.webp]]

**Bones**:
Bony structures offer <u>mechanical protection</u> to the CNS.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Cranium</span>: The brain is enclosed in the cranium of the skull.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Vertebral column</span>: The spinal cord is enclosed in the vertebral column.

**Membranes**:
The <span style="color: lightgreen">meninges</span> are protective membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord.

**Cerebrospinal fluid**:
- It is formed in cavities in the brain and fills the space between the inner and middle meninges, as well as the internal cavities of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord.
- It acts as a <u>shock absorber</u> and offers <u>mechanical support</u> to the brain and the spinal cord, and <u>supplies oxygen and nutrients</u> to the neurones and <u>removes wastes</u> from them.

#### Brain
![[brain.webp|400]]

##### Cerebrum
![[cerebrum.webp]]

The **cerebrum** is the site of <u>consciousness</u>, controlling <u>voluntary actions</u> (e.g. speaking and walking) and associated with intelligence, reasoning, memory, emotions and personality.

**Cerebral hemispheres**:
- Each hemisphere is responsible for the <u>opposite side of the body</u>.
- The two hemispheres are connected by nerve fibres for communication.

**Distribution of grey matter and white matter**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Grey matter (Cerebral cortex)</span>: Thin (< 5 mm) outer later of each hemisphere.
  It contains mainly <span style="color: violet">cell bodies</span> of neurones which <u>appear grey</u>.
  It is also <u>highly folded</u> to increase the surface area so that more neurones can be packed into it.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">White matter</span>: Inner layer beneath the cerebral cortex.
  It appears white due to the <span style="color: violet">white myelin sheaths</span> on the myelinated nerve fibres.

**Functional areas**:
![[cerebrum_funarea.webp|500]]

- **Sensory areas**
	- Receive and interpret nerve impulses from sensory receptors to produce sensations. (e.g. vision, hearing, taste, smell, touch, pain)

- **Association areas**
	- Integrate information from different sensory areas and make decisions in relation to the stored information from the past (i.e. memory).
	- Nerve impulses are generated there and sent to different motor areas to initiate responses.

- **Motor areas**
	- Generate and send nerve impulses to effectors (e.g. skeletal muscles) to produce voluntary responses.

##### Cerebellum
![[cerebellum.webp|450]]
The **cerebellum** is located at the back of the brain under the cerebrum. It coordinates <u>contractions of skeletal muscles</u> for smooth movements and <u>maintains body posture and balance</u>.

As the cerebellum is responsible for precision and fine control of voluntary movements, damaging this region of the brain may result in jerky and uncoordinated movements.

**Distribution of grey matter and white matter**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Grey matter</span>: <u>Highly folded</u> and makes up the outer layer.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">White matter</span>: Makes up the inner layer.

##### Medulla oblongata (Medulla)
The **medulla oblongata** is located at the base of the brain. It controls <u>involuntary actions</u> not under conscious control (e.g. vital processes â€” heart rate, breathing), and also serves as the reflex centre coordinating many reflex actions in the head (e.g. sneezing, coughing, saliva secretion, swallowing)

**Distribution of grey matter and white matter**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Grey matter</span>: Makes up the inner layer.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">White matter</span>: Makes up the relatively smooth outer layer.

#### Spinal cord
![[spinal_cord.webp|600]]

The **spinal cord** is a long cylindrical structure running from <span style="color: violet">medulla oblongata</span> down through vertebral column. It transmits nerve impulses between the brain and other parts of the body, and serves as the <u>reflex centre</u> for reflex actions involving the trunk and the limbs.

**Distribution of grey matter and white matter**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">White matter</span> makes up the <span style="color: violet">outer region</span> which consists of nerve fibres.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Grey matter</span> makes up the <span style="color: violet">inner H-shaped region</span> containing the cell bodies of neurones.
	- It has a <span style="color: lightgreen">central canal</span> filled with <span style="color: violet">cerebrospinal fluid</span> running through the entire length of the spinal cord. It is continuous with the cavities in the brain.

##### Spinal nerves
![[spinal_nerves.webp]]

The <span style="color: lightgreen">dorsal root</span> contains <span style="color: violet">sensory neurones</span> whose cell bodies are located in the <u>dorsal root ganglion</u>, transmitting nerve impulses from receptors to the spinal cord.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">ventral root</span> contains <span style="color: violet">motor neurones</span> whose cell bodies are located in the <u>grey matter</u> of the spinal cord, transmitting nerve impulses from the spinal cord to effectors.
