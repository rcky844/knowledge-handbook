**Homeostasis** is a self-regulating process by which body systems in an organism maintains a stable internal environment.

> **Note**:
> Homeostasis does not maintain a **constant** environment.

Changes in the internal environment are influenced by the external environment (e.g. air temperature) and body activities (e.g. feeding).

In humans, the internal environment refers to the immediate environment of cells (blood & tissue fluid). As cells are sensitive to changes in the environment surrounding them, homeostasis ensures that the cells may function properly.
