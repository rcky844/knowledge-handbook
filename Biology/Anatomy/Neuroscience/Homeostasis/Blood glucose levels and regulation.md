**Blood glucose levels** are regulated by a negative feedback mechanism through the actions of protein hormones insulin and glucagon, <u>secreted by the pancreas</u>.

The pancreas detect changes in blood glucose levels and control the secretion of these hormones. Glucose level is regulated at a set point of around $\pu{90 mg / 100 cm3}$ of blood.

#### Insulin
**Insulin** is a protein hormone that has the following functions:
- Stimulates <span style="color: skyblue">liver cells</span> to <span style="color: lightgreen">convert <u>more</u> glucose to glycogen</span>
- Stimulates <span style="color: skyblue">body cells</span> to <span style="color: lightgreen">take up <u>more</u> glucose from the blood</span>
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Inhibits the secretion of glucagon</span>

Overall, <u>insulin causes blood glucose level to decrease.</u>

#### Glucagon
**Glucagon** is a protein hormone that stimulates <span style="color: skyblue">liver cells</span> to <span style="color: lightgreen">convert <u>more</u> glycogen to glucose</span>.

Overall, <u>glucagon causes blood glucose level to increase.</u>
