**Eye accommodation** refers to the changing of the curvature (shape) of the lens in order to allow light rays from objects at different distances to be focused on the retina. This works because of the elastic nature of the lens of the eye.

> **Note**:
> - Light rays from nearby objects are more divergent (spread out) and require more refraction.
> - Light rays from distant objects are nearly parallel and require less refraction.
