**Irritability** is the ability of organisms to detect stimuli and produce appropriate responses accordingly. It is important to survival as it enables organisms to escape from danger, and look for food and mates.

#### Stimuli and receptors
**Stimuli** are changes in our internal and external environment. They are detected by sensory cells called **receptors**.

Different types of receptors detect different stimuli, some are grouped with other tissues to form a sense organ. Below lists a few main types of receptors:

| Type of receptor |             Stimulus detected             |                     Sense organ(s)                     |
| :--------------: | :---------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
|  Photoreceptor   |                   Light                   |                   [[Human eye\|Eye]]                   |
| Mechanoreceptor  | Sound (pressure wave)<br>Touch (pressure) | [[Human ear\|Ear]]<br>[[Physical barriers#Skin\|Skin]] |
|  Chemoreceptor   | Chemicals in the air<br>Chemicals in food |                     Nose<br>Tongue                     |
|  Thermoreceptor  |          Changes in temperature           |                          Skin                          |

Receptors convert stimuli into <u>nerve impulses</u> that travel along a nerve to the control centre (usually the brain), where they are interpreted as a sensation. The control centre can send nerve impulses to effectors (e.g. muscles or glands) to produce responses.

#### Coordination

- **Nervous coordination**: The nervous system coordinates the receptors and effectors, with the brain serving as the control centre.
- **Hormonal coordination**: Coordination is brought about by the endocrine system.
