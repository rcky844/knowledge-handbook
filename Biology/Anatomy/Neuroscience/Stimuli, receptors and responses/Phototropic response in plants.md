| **Growth response** |                            Towards light<br>(positive phototropism)                             |           Away from light<br>(negative phototropism)            |
|  **Significance**   | Brings the leaves to face the light source to obtain maximum amount of light for photosynthesis | Enables the roots to grow downwards into the soil for anchorage |
