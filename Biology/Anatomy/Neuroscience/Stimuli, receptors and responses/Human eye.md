The **human eye** is a photoreceptor for detecting light. The brain receives the nerve impulses from the eyes and interpret them to produce vision.

#### Structure
![[eye_surroundings_structure.webp]]

##### Surrounding the eye
The eye is a spherical organ situated in an <span style="color: lightgreen">orbit</span>, a bony socket in the skull, which encloses and protects all but the front of the eye.

There are three pairs of <span style="color: lightgreen">eye muscles</span> that attach the eyeball to the wall of the orbit. They contract and relax to allow the eyeball to rotate.

##### Structures protecting the front of the eye
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Eyebrows</span> prevent sweat from entering the eye.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Eyelashes</span> trap dirt before it can enter the eye.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Eyelids</span> can close to protect the eye from foreign objects and strong light.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Tear glands</span> is located above the eyeball and <u>secretes tears</u>.
	- When we blink, the eyelids spread tears over the eye surface, keeping it moist and clean.
	- Tears contain an enzyme called lysozyme to kill bacteria.

##### Internal structures of the eye

###### Outer layer
The <span style="color: lightgreen">sclera</span> is the white of the eye.
- It is a white, opaque, fibrous coat of the eye, which is very tough so that it gives shape to the eyeball and protects the structures inside.
- It is the surface where the eye muscles attach to the eyeball.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">cornea</span> is located in the front part of the eye and is continuous with the sclera.
- It is transparent so that light can enter the eye.
- It has a curved surface that refracts (bends) light.

###### Middle layer
The <span style="color: lightgreen">choroid</span> contains many blood vessels to supply cells of the retina with nutrients and oxygen, and removes carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes produced.
- It is dark in colour because it contains a black pigment to absorb light. This is to prevent reflection of light in the eye and contributes to sharp vision.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">ciliary body</span> is a forward continuation of the choroid.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Ciliary muscles</span>: Ring of circular muscular tissues that surrounds the edge of the lens.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Suspensory ligaments</span>: Connects the ciliary body with the lens and holds it in place.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">lens</span> is a transparent, elastic and biconvex structure that helps refract and focus light onto the retina.
- It consists of living cells that have lost their nuclei. This makes them transparent and allows light to pass through without onbstruction.
- Its elasticity allow the shape of the lens to be changed when looking at objects from different distances.

> **Note**:
> Ciliary muscles in the ciliary body contract or relax to change the tension of suspensory ligaments, and hence the shape of the lens (thickness, curvature) in order to focus light from objects at different distances onto the retina.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">iris</span> lies in front of the lens and is connected to the ciliary body.
- It contains the pigment which gives the eye its colour.
- It consists of circular muscles and radial muscles with a central hole called the <span style="color: lightgreen">pupil</span>.
- The pair of muscles change the size of the pupil, [[controlling the amount of light that enters the eye]].

###### Inner layer
The <span style="color: lightgreen">retina</span> contains two types of photoreceptors (light-sensitive cells), which generate nerve impulses when stimulated by light.
![[rod_cone.webp|400]]

<span style="color: lightgreen">Rod cells</span> are rod-shaped cells that contain the photosensitive pigment <span style="color: red">visual purple</span>, which is very sensitive to light and stimulated by lower light intensities, allowing it to work well in dim light.
- However, it cannot detect colours, they are responsible for black-and-white vision.
- They are evenly distributed across the retina, except for their absence from the yellow spot and the blind spot.

<span style="color: lightgreen">Cone cells</span> are cone-shaped cells that are stimulated by higher light intensities and are used mainly in bright light for [[colour vision]].
- They are less numerous than rod cells â€” most are concentrated at the yellow spot, but few are found in the periphery of the retina. This is why objects appear most clearly when their image fall on the yellow spot.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">yellow spot</span> is located at the central region of the retina and contains cone cells only. Vision in the centre mainly relies on the detection of light falling on the yellow spot.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">blind spot</span> contains no photoreceptors. It is where the optic nerve leaves the eye.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">optic nerve</span> is a bundle of nerve fibres with neurones that are connected with photoreceptors on the retina.
- When the photoreceptos are stimulated by light, nerve impulses are generated to stimulate the visual centre of the brain. They are transmitted via the optic nerve.
- The region where the optic nerve leave the brain is called the <u>blind spot</u>.
