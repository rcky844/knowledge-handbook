The **human eye** is a photoreceptor for detecting light. The brain receives the nerve impulses from the eyes and interpret them to produce vision.

![[eye_surroundings_structure.webp|550]]

#### External structures of the eye
The eye is a spherical organ situated in an <span style="color: lightgreen">orbit</span>, a bony socket in the skull, which encloses and protects all but the front of the eye.

There are three pairs of <span style="color: lightgreen">eye muscles</span> that attach the eyeball to the wall of the orbit. They contract and relax to allow the eyeball to rotate.

##### Structures protecting the front of the eye
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Eyebrows</span> prevent sweat from entering the eye.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Eyelashes</span> trap dirt before it can enter the eye.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Eyelids</span> can close to protect the eye from foreign objects and strong light.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Tear glands</span> is located above the eyeball and <u>secretes tears</u>.
	- When we blink, the eyelids spread tears over the eye surface, keeping it moist and clean.
	- Tears contain an enzyme called lysozyme to kill bacteria.

#### Internal structures of the eye
![[eyeball_structure.webp|550]]

##### Outer layer
The <span style="color: lightgreen">sclera</span> is the white of the eye.
- It is a white, opaque, fibrous coat of the eye, which is very tough so that it gives shape to the eyeball and protects the structures inside.
- It is the surface where the eye muscles attach to the eyeball.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">cornea</span> is located in the front part of the eye and is continuous with the sclera.
- It is transparent so that light can enter the eye.
- It has a curved surface that refracts (bends) light.

##### Middle layer
The <span style="color: lightgreen">choroid</span> contains many blood vessels to supply cells of the retina with nutrients and oxygen, and removes carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes produced.
- It is dark in colour because it contains a black pigment to absorb light. This is to prevent reflection of light in the eye and contributes to sharp vision.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">ciliary body</span> is a forward continuation of the choroid.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Ciliary muscles</span>: Ring of circular muscular tissues that surrounds the edge of the lens.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Suspensory ligaments</span>: Connects the ciliary body with the lens and holds it in place.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">lens</span> is a transparent, elastic and biconvex structure that helps refract and focus light onto the retina.
- It consists of living cells that have lost their nuclei. This makes them transparent and allows light to pass through without onbstruction.
- Its elasticity allow the shape of the lens to be changed when looking at objects from different distances.

> **Note**:
> Ciliary muscles in the ciliary body contract or relax to change the tension of suspensory ligaments, and hence the shape of the lens (thickness, curvature) in order to focus light from objects at different distances onto the retina.
> 
> *See also: [[Eye accommodation]]*

The <span style="color: lightgreen">iris</span> lies in front of the lens and is connected to the ciliary body.
- It contains the pigment which gives the eye its colour.
- It consists of circular muscles and radial muscles with a central hole called the <span style="color: lightgreen">pupil</span>.
- The pair of muscles change the size of the pupil, [[controlling the amount of light that enters the eye]].
	![[iris_pupil.webp|360]]

##### Inner layer
The <span style="color: lightgreen">retina</span> contains two types of photoreceptors (light-sensitive cells), which generate nerve impulses when stimulated by light.
![[rod_cone.webp|400]]

<span style="color: lightgreen">Rod cells</span> are rod-shaped cells that contain the photosensitive pigment <span style="color: red">visual purple</span>, which is very sensitive to light and stimulated by lower light intensities, allowing it to work well in dim light.
- However, it cannot detect colours, they are responsible for black-and-white vision.
- They are evenly distributed across the retina, except for their absence from the yellow spot and the blind spot.

<span style="color: lightgreen">Cone cells</span> are cone-shaped cells that are stimulated by higher light intensities and are used mainly in bright light for [[colour vision]].
- They are less numerous than rod cells â€” most are concentrated at the yellow spot, but few are found in the periphery of the retina. This is why objects appear most clearly when their image fall on the yellow spot.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">yellow spot</span> is located at the central region of the retina and contains cone cells only. Vision in the centre mainly relies on the detection of light falling on the yellow spot.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">blind spot</span> contains no photoreceptors. It is where the optic nerve leaves the eye.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">optic nerve</span> is a bundle of nerve fibres with neurones that are connected with photoreceptors on the retina.
- When the photoreceptos are stimulated by light, nerve impulses are generated to stimulate the visual centre of the brain. They are transmitted via the optic nerve.
- The region where the optic nerve leave the brain is called the <u>blind spot</u>.

![[eye_scopes.webp|500]]

> **Note**:
> Each type of cone cells (red, green and blue cone cells) have a dedicated neurone connected to it.

##### Inside the eyeball
The eyeball is divided into two chambers by the lens internally.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">anterior chamber</span> is the space between the cornea and the lens. It is filled with <span style="color: red">aqueous humour</span>, a clear and watery solution secreted by the ciliary body. It supplies nutrients and oxygen to the cornea and the lens, which have no blood vessels.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">posterior chamber</span> is the space between the lens and the retina. It is filled with <span style="color: red">vitreous humour</span>, a clear and jelly-like fluid secreted by the ciliary body.

These chambers help keep the shape of the eyeball by maintaining the intraocular pressure and inflates the globe of the eye, and refract and focus light onto the retina.

#### Optics of the eye
![[eye_optics.webp|450]]
Light rays from the object enter one's eyes through the cornea and are <u>refracted by the cornea, the aqueous humour, the lens and the vitreous humour</u> to be focused on the retina to form <u>a real, vertically and laterally inverted image that is smaller than the object</u>.

When photoreceptors on the retina are stimulated by light falling on them, they generate and send nerve impulses along the optic nerve to the visual centre of the brain. The brain interprets the nerve impulses to produce vision, allowing us to see an upright image of the object.

Image formed on the blind spot is not visible because it has no photoreceptors to detect light, no nerve impulses are generated to send to the brain.

#### Eye defects
##### Short sight
![[short_sight.webp|150]]
**Short sight** is a defect that causes a person see near objects more clearly than distant objects. It occurs when either the <u>eyeball is too long</u> or that the <u>lens is too thick</u>, or a combination of both.

> **Note**:
> - People with severe short sight have a higher risk for retinal detachment. This happens as the eyeball continues to lengthen, pulling the retina away from the choroid.
> - Since retina contains light sensitive cells and obtains nutrients / oxygen from choroid, light sensitive cells will die and light falling on retina cannot be detected, no nerve impulse can be produced. Therefore, vision is impaired.

**Effects**:
- Light rays from nearby objects focus correctly.
  ![[short_sight_nearby.webp|280]]

- Light rays from distant objects are focused in front of the retina, resulting in a blurred image on the retina.
  ![[short_sight_distant.webp|280]]

**Correction method**:
- By wearing glasses containing concave (diverging) lenses.
- Light rays from distant objects are diverged before entering the eyes, allowing the image to be bright back into focus on the retina.
  ![[short_sight_corr.webp|280]]

##### Long sight
![[long_sight.webp|150]]
**Long sight** is a defect that causes a person see distant objects more clearly than near objects. It occurs when either the <u>eyeball is too short</u> or that the <u>lens is too thin</u>, or a combination of both.

**Effects**:
- Light rays from near objects are focused behind the retina, resulting in a blurred image on the retina.
  ![[long_sight_near.webp|280]]

- Light rays from distant objects focus correctly.
  ![[long_sight_distant.webp|280]]

**Correction method**:
- By wearing glasses containing convex (converging) lenses.
- Light rays from near objects are converged before entering the eyes, a sharp image is formed on the retina.
  ![[long_sight_corr.webp|280]]

##### Colour blindness
![[color_blindness.webp|400]]
**Colour blindness** is an inability to distinguish some or all colours. It is caused by the poor functioning or a deficiency of one or more types of cone cells. Colour blindness is an inherited eye defect. In rare cases, it can be caused by damage to the retina or the brain.

Red-green colour blindness is the most common type of colour blindness in humans, the person would not be able to distinguish red and green because of poor functioning or deficiency of red or green cone cells. Total colour blindness is rare in humans.

There is currently no cure for colour blindness, but colour-blind people generally live a normal life. Mild forms of colour blindness are often not recognized by the person concerned.

Colour blindness can be detected using test cards:
![[color_blind_test.webp]]

Although there are no correction methods, there are aids available to improve the vision. Below lists some examples:
- Wear glasses with special filter lenses to help one see more accurately.
- Mobile phone applications that help colour-blind people see colours using the camera of their smartphones.
