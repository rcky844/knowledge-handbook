**Ventilation** refers to an <span style="color: lightgreen">active</span> movement of air into and out of the lungs to help <u>maintain a steep concentration gradient of gases</u> so that gas exchange can occur efficiently. It is brought about by the <span style="color: lightgreen">movements of intercostal muscles</span> ([[Human skeleton#Rib cage|rib cage]]) <span style="color: lightgreen">and the diaphragm</span>.

> **Note**:
> The change in the volume of the lungs is the result of the change in volume of the thoracic cavity. Therefore, the change in the volume of the thoracic cavity is more relevant in the context of breathing actions.

#### Inhalation
![[inhalation.webp|200]]

- **Intercostal muscles**: Contract
- **Rib cage**: Moves upwards and outwards
- **Diaphragm muscles**: Contract
- **Diaphragm**: Becomes flattened
- **Volume of the thoracic cavity**: Increases
  ↪️ Causes the lungs to expand, increasing the lung volume.
- **Air pressure in the lungs**: Becomes lower than atmospheric pressure
- **Air flow**: Drawn into the lungs

#### Exhalation
![[exhalation.webp|200]]

- **Intercostal muscles**: Relax
- **Rib cage**: Moves downwards and inwards
- **Diaphragm muscles**: Relax
- **Diaphragm**: Returns to its original dome shape
- **Volume of the thoracic cavity**: Decreases
  ↪️ Causes the lungs to deflate, decreasing the lung volume.
- **Air pressure in the lungs**: Becomes higher than atmospheric pressure
- **Air flow**: Forced out of the lungs

#### Describing ventilation patterns
By changing the volume of the lungs, the lung pressure is also changed. When the patterns of ventilation is plotted on a graph:
