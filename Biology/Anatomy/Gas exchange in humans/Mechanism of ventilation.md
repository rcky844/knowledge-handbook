**Ventilation** refers to the movement of air into and out of the lungs to help maintain a steep concentration gradient of gases so that gas exchange can occur effectively. It is brought about by the movements of intercostal muscles (rib cage) and the diaphragm, which includes inhalation and exhalation.

#### Inhalation
![[inhalation.webp|200]]

- **Intercostal muscles**: Contract
- **Rib cage**: Moves upwards and outwards
- **Diaphragm muscles**: Contract
- **Diaphragm**: Becomes flattened
- **Volume of the thoracic cavity**: Increases
- **Lungs**: Expands and its volume increases
- **Air pressure in the lungs**: Becomes lower than atmospheric pressure
- **Air flow**: Drawn into the lungs

#### Exhalation

- **Intercostal muscles**: Relax
- **Rib cage**: Moves downwards and inwards
- **Diaphragm muscles**: Relax
- **Diaphragm**: Returns to its original dome shape
- **Volume of the thoracic cavity**: Decreases
- **Lungs**: Deflates and its volume decreases
- **Air pressure in the lungs**: Becomes higher than atmospheric pressure
- **Air flow**: Forced out of the lungs

By changing the volume of the lungs, the lung pressure is also changed.

> **Note**:
> The outer walls of air sacs contain elastic protein fibres.
> These fibres make the air sacs elastic, allowing them to expand and shrink.
> Once the intercostal and diaphragm muscles relax, the air sacs can shrink (recoil) and return to their original size. Hence, exhalation can occur even without muscles contractions of the lungs or air sacs themselves.
