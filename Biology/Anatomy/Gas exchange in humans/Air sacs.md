#### Structural adaptation of air sacs for gas exchange
*See also: [[Gas exchange in the air sacs]]*

- **Air sacs are very numerous in number.**
  This provides a large surface area for diffusion of gases.

- **The inner surfaces of the air sacs are covered with a moist film of watery mucus.**
  This allows oxygen to diffuse in it and diffuse across the air sacs.

- **The walls of air sacs are one-cell thick and made up of only one layer of epithelial cells.**
  This provides a short distance for diffusion of gases.

- **Air sacs are surrounded by a dense network of blood capillaries.**
  This provides a rich blood supply to readily transport the gases to and from the air sacs, maintaining a steep concentration gradient of gases.

- **The walls of air sacs (also one-cell thick) lie close to the walls of the blood capillaries.**
  This reduces the distance for diffusion of gases.
