> **Note**:
> The outer walls of air sacs contain elastic protein fibres.
> These fibres make the air sacs elastic, allowing them to expand and shrink.
> Once the intercostal and diaphragm muscles relax, the air sacs can shrink (recoil) and return to their original size. Hence, exhalation can occur even without muscles contractions of the lungs or air sacs themselves.

#### Structural adaptation for gas exchange
*See also: [[Gas exchange in the air sacs]]*

- **Air sacs are very numerous in number.**
  This provides a <u>large surface area</u> for diffusion of gases.

- **The inner surfaces of the air sacs are covered with a moist water film.**
  The water film is moistened with watery mucus. This allows <span style="color: skyblue">oxygen</span> to dissolve in it and diffuse across the wall of the air sacs more readily.

- **The walls of air sacs is one-cell thick and made up of only one layer of epithelial cell.**
  This provides a <u>short distance for diffusion of gases</u>.

- **Air sacs are surrounded by a dense network of blood capillaries.**
  This provides a <u>rich blood supply</u> to <u>readily transport the gases to and from the air sacs</u>, <u>maintaining a steep concentration gradient of gases</u>.

- **The walls of air sacs lie close to the walls of the blood capillaries.**
  There is a shorter distance for gas exchange between internal and external environments, <u>reducing the distance for diffusion of gases</u>.

#### Complications reducing ability for gas exchange
##### Accumulation of fluids
Patients with lung inflammation may have fluid accumulated in the air sacs.
- It <u>increases the distance for diffusion</u> of gases.
- It <u>reduces the surface area of the water film</u> for dissolving gases.

##### Dust deposition
When breathing in dusty air, and when the mechanisms that come before the lung fail to filter out the dust, dust may deposit on the surfaces of the air sacs.
- It forms a barrier and <u>increases the diffusion distance</u>.
- Significant portions of the inner surface of the air sacs can be blocked by dust, <u>reducing the surface area for diffusion</u> of gases.
- Hardened layer of dust can <u>reduce the elasticity of lungs</u>, this reduces the volume of the lungs when it inflates.
