#### Pharynx
**Pharynx** is a passage for food and respiratory gases.
- Food and drinks enter the oesophagus from the pharynx.
- <u>Respiratory gases continue down the larynx.</u>

#### Larynx
**Larynx** is a passage for air only.
- During swallowing, the larynx rises.

#### Epiglottis
The **epiglottis** is a flap that <u>covers the trachea</u> (glottis) during swallowing.
It ensures <u>food does not enter the lungs</u> and <u>prevents choking</u>.

#### Vocal cords
The **vocal cords** are two thin elastic membranes <span style="color: lightgreen">within the larynx</span> that <u>vibrate to produce sound</u> when air is forced through them.
