#### Pharynx
**Pharynx** is a passage for food and respiratory gases. Food and drinks enter the oesophagus from the pharynx, where as respiratory gases continue down the larynx.

#### Larynx
**Larynx** is a passage for air only. During swallowing, the larynx rises.

#### Epiglottis
The **epiglottis** is a flap that covers the trachea (glottis) during swallowing so that food does not enter the lungs and prevents choking.

#### Vocal cords
The **vocal cords** are two thin elastic membranes within the larynx that vibrate to produce sound when air is forced through them.
