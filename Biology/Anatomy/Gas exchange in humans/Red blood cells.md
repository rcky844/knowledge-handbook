#### Structural adaptations of red blood cells for carrying oxygen

- **Red blood cells are packed with haemoglobin.**
  Haemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that can bind with oxygen to serve as an oxygen carrier.

- **Red blood cells have a biconcave disc shape.**
  This provides a larger surface area to volume ratio to facilitate the diffusion of oxygen into and out of the cells; and shortens the distance for oxygen to reach and leave haemoglobin in the cells.

- **Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus.**
  This enables them to hold more haemoglobin and thus carry more oxygen.
