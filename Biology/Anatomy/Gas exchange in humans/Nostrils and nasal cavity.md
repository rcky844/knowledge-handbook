#### Nostrils
The **nostrils** are the entry for air. They are lined with <span style="color: skyblue">nasal hairs</span> and forms a [[Physical barriers|physical barrier]] to filter out dust and other particles from the air.

#### Nasal cavity
The **nasal cavity** is the space inside the nose. It has a few distinctive features:
- The wall is lined with <span style="color: skyblue">mucus-secreting cells</span> secreting mucus, which <u>traps dust particles and bacteria</u> and also <u>moistens the incoming air</u> to a saturated level.
- The wall is also lined with <span style="color: skyblue">ciliated epithelial cells</span>. The cilia extending out of these cells <u>beat in a wave-like manner</u>. This beating action <u>sweeps the mucus towards the pharynx</u> (throat) where it is either swallowed or coughed out.
- It is well supplied with <span style="color: skyblue">blood capillaries</span> which helps <u>warm the incoming air</u>.

The cells of the nasal cavity are <span style="color: lightgreen">closely-packed</span>. This forms a [[Physical barriers|physical barrier]] to prevent pathogens from entering body tissues.
