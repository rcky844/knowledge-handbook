#### Nostrils
The **nostrils** are the entry for air. They are lined with nasal hairs and forms a [[Physical barriers|physical barrier]] to filter out dust and other particles from the air.


#### Nasal cavity
The **nasal cavity** is the space inside the nose. It has a few distinctive features:
- The wall is lined with <u>mucus-secreting cells</u> secreting mucus, which traps dust particles and bacteria and also moistens the incoming air to a saturated level.
- The wall is also lined with <u>ciliated epithelial cells</u>. The cilia extending out of these cells beat in a wave-like manner. This beating action sweeps the mucus towards the pharynx (throat) where it is either swallowed or coughed out.
- It is well supplied with <u>blood capillaries</u> which helps warm the incoming air.
