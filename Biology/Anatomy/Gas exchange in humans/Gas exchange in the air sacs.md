The pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the capillaries surrounding the air sacs. After gas exchange, blood is oxygenated and returns to the heart by the pulmonary veins.

##### Before gas exchange
- Pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the capillaries surrounding the air sacs.

##### Oxygen diffuses into the blood
- Oxygen in breathed in fresh air dissolves in the water film on the inner surface of the air sacs.
- As the oxygen concentration of the water film is higher than that of blood in the capillaries, oxygen diffuses across the walls of the air sacs and the capillaries into the blood to combine with haemoglobin in the red blood cells.

##### Carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood
- As the carbon dioxide concentration of the blood is higher than the air in the air sacs, carbon dioxide diffuses across the walls of the capillaries and the air sacs into the air in the air sacs.
- Carbon dioxide is then removed in exhaled air when we breathe out.

##### After gas exchange
- Blood is oxygenated and returns to the heart by the pulmonary veins.

#### Composition of inhaled and exhaled air

- **Oxygen**: inhaled air > exhaled air
  Oxygen in inhaled air diffuses into the blood in the air sacs and are then taken up by body cells for respiration.

- **Carbon dioxide**: inhaled air < exhaled air
  Carbon dioxide is produced by body cells during respiration and diffuses from blood into the air sacs to be exhaled.

> **Note**:
> Exhaled air does not contain more carbon dioxide than oxygen.

- **Nitrogen & other gases**: unchanged
  These gases are not used or produced by body cells

- **Water vapour**: variable → saturated
  Exhaled air is moistened by the water film in the air sacs and the mucus in the respiratory tract.

- **Temperature**: variable → ~34°C
  Exhaled air is warmed by the blood capillaries surrounding the air sacs and lining the respiratory tract.
