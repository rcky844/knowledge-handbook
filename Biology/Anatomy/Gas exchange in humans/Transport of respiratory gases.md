#### Oxygen
##### Methods
- Transported in the blood and carried by [[red blood cells]] (>98%)
- Transported as dissolved oxygen in blood plasma. (<2%)

##### Processes
![[oxygen_transport.webp|500]]

1. **In the lungs**
	- The oxygen concentration in the air sacs is high. This is because fresh air enters the air sacs when breathing in.
	- Oxygen dissolves in a thin water film on the inner wall of the air sac.
	- Oxygen diffuses across the wall of air sac into the plasma. This happens as oxygen concentration is lower in blood.
	- Oxygen diffuses from plasma into red blood cells to combine with haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin, which gives the blood its bright red colour.
	- Oxygenated blood is transported to tissues by the circulatory system.

2. **In body tissues**
	- The oxygen content of tissue fluid is lower than that of blood, as body cells continuously take up oxygen from the blood for respiration.
	- Oxyhaemoglobin dissociates to become oxygen and haemoglobin, and oxygen leaves the blood and diffuses into the tissue fluid.
	- After releasing most of its oxygen, the blood becomes deoxygenated and is dark purplish red in colour.

#### Carbon dioxide
##### Methods
- Transported as hydrogencarbonate ions in the plasma. (~70%)
- Transported by binding to haemoglobin in the red blood cells as carbaminohaemoglobin. (~23%)
- Transported as dissolved carbon dioxide in blood plasma. (small amount)

##### Processes
![[carbon_dioxide_transport.webp|500]]

1. **In the lungs**
	- The carbon dioxide concentration in body tissues is high, as carbon dioxide is continuously produced by cells during respiration.
	- Carbon dioxide enters the tissue fluid from the cells and diffuses into the blood.
	- Carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells, in which carbon dioxide chemically react with water to form bicarbonate ions. It then diffuses from red blood cells to plasma, and are transported to air sacs of the lungs in this form.

2. **In body tissues**
	- The carbon dioxide concentration in the air sacs is low. This is because air in the air sacs is removed when we breathe out.
	- Bicarbonate ions diffuses into red blood cells and undergo a chemical reaction with water to re-form carbon dioxide.
	- Carbon dioxide moves into plasma from red blood cells and finally diffuses into the air sacs and exhaled.
