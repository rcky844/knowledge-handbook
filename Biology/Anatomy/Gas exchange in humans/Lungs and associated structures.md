The **lungs** are two spongy, pinkish organs close to the heart in the thoracic cavity. The [[Trachea, bronchi and bronchioles#Bronchioles|bronchioles]] end in clusters of air sacs inside of the lungs.

#### Structures to protect the lungs and aid breathing

As the lungs contain no muscles and are not able to expand or contract on their own. Instead, breathing is brought about by the movements of intercostal muscles (rib cage) and the diaphragm.

The lungs are surrounded and protected by the rib cage, which is formed by 12 pairs of ribs, the sternum and the vertebral column. The intercostal muscles lie between them.

The diaphragm is a dome-shaped sheet of muscle below the lungs that separate the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity.

Each lung is enclosed by two pleural membrane. The inner membrane is attached to the lungs, while the outer membrane lines the thoracic cavity. A narrow space between the two membranes called pleural cavity is formed.

Pleural membranes secrete pleural into the cavity to reduce friction between the lungs and the rib cage during breathing movements.
