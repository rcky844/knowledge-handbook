The **lungs** are two spongy, pinkish organs close to the heart in the thoracic cavity. The [[Trachea, bronchi and bronchioles#Bronchioles|bronchioles]] end in clusters of air sacs inside of the lungs.

> **Note**:
> There is always a slightly negative pressure within the thoracic cavity, which <u>aids in keeping the airways of the lungs open</u>.

#### Structures to protect the lungs and aid breathing

The <u>lungs contain no muscles</u> and are not able to expand or contract on their own. Instead, breathing is brought about by the <span style="color: lightgreen">movements of intercostal muscles</span> ([[Human skeleton#Rib cage|rib cage]]) <span style="color: lightgreen">and the diaphragm</span>.

The <span style="color: skyblue">lungs</span> are <u>surrounded and protected by the rib cage</u>, which is formed by 12 pairs of ribs, the sternum and the vertebral column. The <span style="color: skyblue">intercostal muscles</span> lie between them.

The <span style="color: skyblue">diaphragm</span> is a <u>dome-shaped sheet of muscle</u> below the lungs that separate the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity.

> **Note**:
> The lung is an elastic structure that tends to decrease its size at all volumes. If there is a leakage of air, the lungs would collapse as a result.

Each lung is enclosed by two <span style="color: skyblue">pleural membrane</span>. The inner membrane is attached to the lungs, while the outer membrane lines the thoracic cavity.

The <span style="color: skyblue">pleural cavity</span> is a narrow space between the two membranes. <span style="color: lightgreen">Pleural membranes secrete pleural fluid</span> into the cavity to <u>reduce friction between the lungs and the rib cage</u> during breathing movements.

> **Note**:
> The pleural cavity always maintains a negative pressure.
