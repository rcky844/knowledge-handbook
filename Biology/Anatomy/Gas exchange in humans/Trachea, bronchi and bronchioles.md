#### Trachea
The **trachea** is a passage for air that runs next to the oesophagus. It has C-shaped rings of cartilage in its walls to keep the trachea open for air to pass through freely, while allowing the oesophagus next to it to expand when food passes down it.

If there is no cartilage to support the trachea, it would collapse due to the negative pressure created during inhalation.

The inner wall of trachea are also lined with ciliated epithelial cells and mucus-secreting cells.

#### Bronchus
The **bronchus**, unlike the trachea, is supported by complete rings of cartilage. Its inner walls are also lined with ciliated epithelial cells and mucus-secreting cells.

#### Bronchioles
The **bronchioles** does not have cartilage. Note that the larger bronchioles are also lined with ciliated epithelial cells and mucus-secreting cells.
