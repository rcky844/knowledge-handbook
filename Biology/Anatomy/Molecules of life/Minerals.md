**Minerals** in organisms occur as inorganic ions dissolved in [[Cytoplasm]] and body fluids. They are essential for regulating [[Metabolism]], but only needed in small amounts, as too much of it may affect water potential or disrupt neural signalling.

#### Nitrates ($\ce{NO3-}$)
- For making [[Proteins]], [[Nucleic acids]] and [[Chlorophyll]].

#### Magnesium ($\ce{Mg^2+}$)
- For making [[Chlorophyll]] in plants.
- A minor component of bones and teeth.

#### Calcium ($\ce{Ca^2+}$)
- For muscle contractions and blood clotting.
- A major component of bones, teeth and shells.

#### Iron ($\ce{Fe^3+}$)
- For making [[Chlorophyll]] in plants.
- For making haemoglobin in [[red blood cells]].

#### Phosphorous / Phosphate ($\ce{PO4^3-}$)
- For making [[Nucleic acids]], [[Cell membrane]] and ATP.

#### Potassium ($\ce{K+}$)
- Important for nerve impulse transmission and muscle contractions.

#### Sodium ($\ce{Na+}$)
- Important for maintaining water balance and nerve impulse transmission.

#### Chloride ($\ce{Cl-}$)
- Important for maintaining water balance and nerve impulse transmission.
- For making hydrochloric acid in gastric juice.
