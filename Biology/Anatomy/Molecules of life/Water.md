### Importance of water

##### As a good solvent
- As the medium in which chemical reactions involving dissolved substances take place within organisms.
- As a good transport medium for transporting nutrients, gases and metabolic wastes (e.g. circulatory system)

#### As a reactant in some metabolic reactions
- [[Condensation & Hydrolysis|Hydrolysis]]
  Breakdown of complex food molecules into simple molecules with water.
- [[Photosynthesis]]
  Plants use light energy to convert water and carbon dioxide to carbohydrates (e.g. glucose) and oxygen.

#### Takes away heat during evaporation (a cooling agent)
- [[Evaporation of sweat]]
  Takes away heat from the skin and helps cool the body.
- [[Transpiration]]
  Prevents plants from overheating.

#### As a temperature buffer
Absorbs a large amount of heat (-4.2 J g<sup>-1</sup>) to raise its temperature by 1Â°C.
- Organisms contain a large proportion of water. This helps to maintain a fairly stable body temperature.
- Temperature of large bodies of water remains relatively stable. This provides a favourable habitat for aquatic organisms.

#### Provides support to organisms / Aid movement
Water is incompressible.
- [[Hydrostatic skeleton]]
  Support and allow movement in animals with body cavities filled with fluid (e.g. earthworm, jellyfish)
- [[Turgidity]]
  Plant cells become turgid when they contain sufficient water. This provides support to young seedlings and non-woody plants.
- [[Buoyancy]]
  For aquatic organisms.
- [[Lubrication]]
  Reduce friction between bones during movement.
