- **Components**: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus
- **Basic units**: nucleotides
- **Functions**:
	- Carry genetic information
	- Play important roles in heredity and protein synthesis

### Structure
- The sugar-phosphate backbone links nucleotides to form a polynucleotide chain by [[Condensation & Hydrolysis|condensation]].
	- The two strands of DNA have an anti-parallel relationship.
- In DNA, complementary chains of polynucleotides are joined together at the nitrogenous bases with hydrogen bonds. The differences in the hydrogen bonds formed allow for base pairing:
	- A-T: 2 bonds
	- G-C: 3 bonds
