**Blood** is a lipid tissue consisting of blood cells suspended in plasma. A human adult has about five litres of blood.

> [!tip] Analysis of blood
> When blood is spun at high speed in a centrifuge, the blood cells go to the bottom part of the tube, and a pale yellow layer on top is plasma.

> This process allows for separation of components in blood, allowing for further analysis.

# Composition of blood
## Plasma
**Plasma** is the liquid part of blood made up of mostly water (90%) with a variety of dissolved substances.
- **Plasma proteins** ([[Blood clotting|fibrinogen]], [[antibodies]]) for blood clotting and body defence.
- **Inorganic ions** for regulating blood pH and [[osmosis]].
- **Nutrients** act as <span class="hi-green">energy sources</span> or for the <span class="hi-green">synthesis</span> of other biomolecules.
- **Respiratory gases** are transported within blood. Oxygen is used in [[respiration]] to release energy, while carbon dioxide is a waste product of respiration.
- **Urea** is a waste product of protein Metabolism.
- **Hormones** serve as chemical messengers that regulate metabolic processes.

> Carbon dioxide is slightly soluble in water, it dissolves to form an acid $\ce{H2CO3}$.

# Functions of blood
1. **Transport of substances**
	- *Oxygen* <u>(lungs → body cells)</u> is carried by <span class="hi-blue">haemoglobin</span> in red blood cells, while some are dissolved in plasma to be used in [[respiration]].
	- *Carbon dioxide* <u>(body cells → lungs)</u> are mostly transported in plasma as <span class="hi-blue">hydrogencarbonate ions</span> for removal in exhaled gases.
	- *Nutrients* are transported in plasma from the small intestine to the liver, and then to other parts of the body.
	- *Urea* <u>(liver → kidneys)</u> is the <span class="hi-green">waste product</span> formed from [[deamination]], which is transported to the kidneys to be excreted in urine.
	- *Hormones* are secreted by <span class="hi-blue">endocrine glands</span> into the bloodstream and transported in plasma to their target organs to regulate metabolic processes.
	- *Antibodies* are produced by <span class="hi-blue">lymphocytes</span> and are transported in plasma for body defence.

2. **Body defence**
	- [[Blood clotting]]: <span class="hi-blue">Blood platelets</span> play a role in blood clotting; the formation of blood clots at wounds prevents entry of pathogens and further loss of blood.
	- [[Phagocytosis (body defence)|Phagocytosis]]: <span class="hi-blue">Phagocytes</span> engulf and digest invading pathogens.
	- Production of [[antibodies]]: Lymphocytes produce <span class="hi-blue">antibodies</span> which destroy pathogens or neutralize the toxins produced by pathogens.

3. **Distribution of heat**
   Blood <span class="hi-green">absorbs heat from metabolically active organs</span> (e.g. liver and muscles), and distributes it throughout the body, which helps maintain a constant body temperature.
