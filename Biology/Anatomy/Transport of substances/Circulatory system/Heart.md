![[heart.webp|450]]

The **heart** is an organ made up mainly of cardiac muscles lying in the thoracic cavity, protected by the [[Human skeleton#Rib cage|rib cage]].
- It contracts and relaxes rhythmically <span class="hi-green">without fatigue throughout life to pump blood</span> around the body continuously to ensure a continuous blood flow.
- It is surrounded by a tough protective sac called the pericardium.

# Components

## Atria
Both **atria** receive blood from the <span class="hi-blue">veins</span>, and have <span class="hi-green">thinner walls than ventricles</span> as they only need to pump blood into the ventricle through a small distance.
- The <span class="hi-blue">left atrium</span> receives <span class="hi-blue">deoxygenated blood</span> from all parts of the body (except the lungs) through the <u>superior vena cava</u> and <u>inferior vena cava</u>.
- The <span class="hi-blue">right atrium</span> receives <span class="hi-blue">oxygenated blood</span> from the lungs through the <u>pulmonary veins</u>.

## Ventricles
Both **ventricles** receive blood from the <span class="hi-blue">atria</span>, and have <span class="hi-green">thicker and more muscular wall than atria</span> as they need to create greater muscular contractions to produce high blood pressure for transporting blood through a long distance.
- The <span class="hi-blue">left ventricle</span> receives <span class="hi-blue">oxygenated blood</span> from the left atrium and pumps the blood to all parts of the body (except the lungs) through the <u>aorta</u>.
- The <span class="hi-blue">right ventricle</span> receives <span class="hi-blue">deoxygenated blood</span> from the right atrium and pumps the blood to the lungs through the <u>pulmonary arteries</u>.

## Septum
The (atrial / ventricular) **septum** is a muscular wall that separates the right and left sides of the heart to <span class="hi-green">prevent the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood</span>.

## Heart valves
**Heart valves** are present to <span class="hi-green">prevent the backflow of blood</span> and ensure blood flows through the heart in one direction only.

*Bicuspid valve and tricuspid valve*:
They separate atrium from ventricle, and are closed by the high pressure of blood in each ventricle when ventricles contract to <span class="hi-green">prevent backflow of blood into the atria</span>.

![[bicuspid_tricuspid_valve.webp|160]]
- The <span class="hi-blue">bicuspid valve</span> has two flaps, separates the <u>left atrium and left ventricle</u>.
- The <span class="hi-blue">tricuspid valve</span> has three flaps, separates the <u>right atrium and right ventricle</u>.

*Semilunar valves*:
Semilunar valves are pocket-shaped structures found at the <u>base of the aorta and the pulmonary artery</u>. They close to <span class="hi-green">prevent backflow of blood into the ventricles</span>.

## Cardiac muscles
**Cardiac muscles** are muscles that makes up the heart.
- Located in the walls of the heart to give a driving force for maintaining blood flow.
- Their cells contain many [[mitochondria]] which <u>provide a lot of ATP</u> for <span class="hi-green">continuous contraction</span>, and is highly resistant to fatigue.
- Receives oxygen and nutrients from the <span class="hi-blue">coronary arteries</span> branched off from the aorta. Carbon dioxide and other metabolic wastes are carried away through the <span class="hi-blue">coronary veins</span>.
