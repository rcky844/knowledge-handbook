In a **double circulation** system, <span class="hi-green">blood flows through the heart twice</span>. This is the most efficient way of circulation found in all mammals.

([[Major blood vessels and organs]])

*Parts of circulation*:
- **Pulmonary circulation**: Connects the heart and the lungs
- **Systemic circulation**: Connects the heart and all parts of the body
  (except the lungs)

*Advantages*:
- **Separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood**
  The pulmonary circulation is separated from the systemic circulation so that only oxygenated blood is carried to the body tissues.

- **Blood pressures of each circulation can be kept different**
  (compared to single circulation)
	- Strong contractions of the left ventricle <span class="hi-green">create high blood pressure</span> to <u>move blood quickly</u> through the systemic circulation to all parts of the body.
	- Weaker contraction of the right ventricle <span class="hi-green">protects the delicate capillaries in the lungs from damage by high pressure</span>.
