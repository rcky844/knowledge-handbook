**Tissue fluid** fills small spaces in between body cells, and <span class="hi-green">maintains a relatively stable environment</span> for the cells and serves as the <span class="hi-green">medium across which exchange of materials</span> between the blood and body cells takes place.

# Formation of tissue fluid
*Process*:
- Tissue fluid is formed from blood in a <span class="hi-blue">capillary bed</span>.
- The <span class="hi-blue">hydrostatic pressure</span> of the blood is <u>higher</u> than the tissue fluid at the arterial end of the capillary bed.
- Some components of the plasma are forced out through the <span class="hi-blue">differentially permeable</span> capillary walls to become tissue fluid.

*Composition*:
- Tissue fluid contains <span class="hi-green">water, mineral, glucose, amino acids, lipids and hormones</span>.
- Tissue fluid does not contain <span class="hi-blue">plasma proteins, red blood cells and blood platelets</span> as they are too large to pass through the walls of capillaries.
- Some types of <span class="hi-blue">white blood cells</span> (e.g. [[Phagocytosis (body defence)|phagocytes]]) can squeeze through the capillary walls and enter the tissue fluid to <u>fight against invading pathogens</u>. The tissue fluid also plays a role in [[Lymphocytes#B cells|humoral immunity]].

# Exchange of materials in capillary beds
Exchange of materials between the tissue fluid and body cells takes place by [[diffusion]] and only at capillary beds.

Body cells constantly take up oxygen and nutrients from the surrounding tissue fluid for [[respiration]] and [[metabolism]], while producing carbon dioxide and other metabolic wastes.

# Returning of tissue fluid to the blood
At the venous end of the capillary bed, excessive loss of water and the presence of plasma proteins cause the blood to have <span class="hi-blue">low hydrostatic pressure</span> and <span class="hi-green">lower water potential than tissue fluid</span>. Water is drawn into the capillaries by [[osmosis]].

About 90% of the tissue fluid returns to the blood at the <span class="hi-blue">venous end</span>. The remaining 10% drains into lymph capillaries, which are part of the [[lymphatic system]].
