# Arteries
![[arteries.webp|600]]

## Structural features
- *Direction of blood flow*: Away from the heart (heart â†’ body tissues)
- *Blood pressure*: High (pumping action of the heart)
- *Oxygenation of blood*: Oxygenated
  (except pulmonary artery and umbilical artery of an unborn baby)
- *Location*: Most are located deep in the body
- *Wall*: Thicker muscular wall with lots of elastic fibres
- *Lumen*: Relatively small
- *Valves*: Absent (except at the base of pulmonary artery and aorta)
- *Rate of blood flow*: Faster

## Structural adaptations
- Arteries have <span class="hi-blue">very thick walls</span> to <span class="hi-green">withstand the high pressure of the blood</span>.
- The walls of the arteries contain <span class="hi-blue">large number of elastic fibres</span> that <u>stretches and recoils</u> when the heart contracts and relaxes respectively. This helps <span class="hi-green">maintain blood pressure</span> and <span class="hi-green">continuous blood flow</span>.
- The walls of arteries have a <span class="hi-blue">thick muscle layer</span>, which <span class="hi-green">regulate blood flow</span> to certain organs or tissues by contracting or relaxing to change the diameter of the vessels to .

# Veins
![[veins.webp|600]]

## Structural features
- *Direction of blood flow*: Towards the heart
- *Blood pressure*: Low
  (blood has overcome resistance from the walls of blood vessels after travelling through many vessels over a long distance)
- *Oxygenation of blood*: Deoxygenated
  (except pulmonary vein and umbilical vein of an unborn baby)
- *Location*: Most are located closer to the body surface (for <span class="hi-green">heat dissipation</span>)
- *Wall*: Thinner wall with fewer elastic fibres
- *Lumen*: Relatively large
- *Valves*: Present
- *Rate of blood flow*: Slower

**Force to move the blood**:
- *Contraction of skeletal muscles* adjacent to the veins aids blood flow. When these skeletal muscles contract, the <span class="hi-green">veins are squeezed</span> and the blood inside is forced towards the heart.
- *Inhalation* creates <span class="hi-blue">negative pressure</span> in the <span class="hi-blue">thoracic cavity</span> that facilitates the flow of blood in veins back to the heart.

## Structural adaptations
- Veins have a <span class="hi-blue">larger lumen than arteries</span>, which <span class="hi-green">reduces resistance</span> so that blood can continue to flow in the veins at low pressure.
- <span class="hi-blue">Valves</span> are present to <span class="hi-green">prevent the backflow of blood</span> to ensure that blood flows in <u>one direction only</u> (towards the heart).

# Capillaries
![[capillaries.webp|600]]

## Structural features
- *Direction of blood flow*: Connect arteries and veins
- *Blood pressure*: Falls when the blood travels from arterial end to venous end
- *Oxygenation of blood*: Oxygenated at arterial end, deoxygenated at venous end
- *Location*: In body tissues (for exchange of materials between blood and body cells, forms networks called capillary beds)
- *Wall*: One-cell thick
- *Lumen*: Very small
- *Valves*: Absent
- *Rate of blood flow*: Very slow

## Structural adaptations
- The capillaries are <span class="hi-blue">highly branched</span> to reduce resistance so that blood can continue to <span class="hi-green">flow in the veins at low pressure</span>.
- The capillaries are <span class="hi-blue">very close to tissue cells</span> to <u>prevent the backflow of blood</u>, ensuring that <span class="hi-green">blood flows in one direction only</span> (towards the heart).
- The capillary network has a <span class="hi-blue">very large cross-sectional area</span> so that <u>blood flows slowly</u>, which <span class="hi-green">allows more time for the exchange</span> of materials.
- The capillary wall is <span class="hi-blue">one-cell thick</span> to provide a <span class="hi-green">short diffusion distance</span> for the exchange of materials.
- The <span class="hi-blue">lumen size of capillaries is very small</span>, which brings red blood cells in close contact with the capillary wall, which <span class="hi-green">reduces the distance for oxygen to diffuse</span> from red blood cells to the body tissues.
- The capillary wall is <span class="hi-blue">differentially permeable</span>, <span class="hi-green">allowing small and soluble substances to be exchanged</span>, while retaining large molecules (e.g. plasma protein) in the blood.
