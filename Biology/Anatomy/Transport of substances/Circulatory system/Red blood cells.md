**Function**: Contain haemoglobin to carry oxygen
**Structural features**:
- Biconcave disc shape
- Red in colour (due to the presence of haemoglobin)
- Mature cells have <u>no nucleus and organelles</u>.
**Size**: About 8 μm in diameter and 2 μm in thickness
**Site of production**: Bone marrow
**No. of cells per mm<sup>3</sup>**: 4.2 - 6.2 million
**Life span**: About 120 days
**Destruction**:
- Occurs in liver and spleen
- Haemoglobin is broken down into iron (to produce new red blood cells) and bile pigment (excreted in [[Small intestines#Bile|bile]])

# Structural adaptations of red blood cells for carrying oxygen

- **Red blood cells are packed with haemoglobin.**
  Haemoglobin is an <u>iron-containing protein</u> that can bind with oxygen to serve as an <span class="hi-green">oxygen carrier</span>.

- **Red blood cells have a biconcave disc shape.**
  This provides a <u>larger surface area</u> to volume ratio to facilitate the [[Diffusion]] of oxygen into and out of the cells; and <u>shortens the diffusion distance for oxygen</u> to reach and leave haemoglobin in the cells.

- **Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus.**
  This enables them to <u>hold more haemoglobin</u> and thus <u>carry more oxygen</u>.
