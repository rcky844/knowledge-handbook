# Structures
## Lymph
The **lymph** is formed when tissue fluid flows into lymph capillaries.

*Composition*: (similar to tissue fluid and blood)
- No [[red blood cells]], [[blood platelets]] or plasma proteins (cannot enter tissue fluid)
- Less oxygen and nutrients (as they have been absorbed by the body cells)
- More carbon dioxide and wastes that have been released from the body cells
- More lipids and fat-soluble vitamins that have been absorbed from the small intestine through [[Small intestines#Adaptations|lacteals]]

## Lymph capillaries
![[lymph_capilaries.webp|400]]

**Lymph capillaries** are tiny, blind-ended vessels found in many tissues of the body. Their walls are <span class="hi-green">one-cell thick</span>.

Tissue fluid can pass through the spaces between their cells and enter into the lymph capillaries by <span class="hi-blue">hydrostatic pressure</span>.

## Lymph vessels
![[lymph_vessels.webp|350]]

**Lymph vessels** are large vessels joined by smaller lymph capillaries from different parts of the body, which then join two large veins at the base of the neck, returning lymph to the blood.

*Flow of lymph in lymph vessels*:
- **Contractions of skeletal muscles adjacent to lymph vessels**
  When the skeletal muscles contract, they <span class="hi-green">press against lymph vessels</span>, pushing the lymph along.

- **Valves are present in lymph vessels** (similar to those in veins)
  They <span class="hi-green">prevent the backflow of lymph</span> and ensure that the lymph flows only towards the heart.

## Lymph nodes
![[lymph_nodes.webp]]

**Lymph nodes** are small swellings at intervals along the lymph vessels.
- They store [[white blood cells]]. When lymph flows through lymph nodes, the pathogens contained within will be destroyed by the white blood cells.
- Lymph is effectively filtered by the lymph node before returning the the bloodstream. It helps in <u>body defence</u>.

# Functions
- It <span class="hi-green">collects excess tissue fluid</span> and returns the fluid to the blood.
- It <span class="hi-green">transports lipids and fat-soluble vitamins</span> from the lacteals of intestinal villi to the blood.
- Lymph nodes remove pathogens from the lymph, it is <span class="hi-green">important for body defence</span>.
