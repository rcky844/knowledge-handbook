# Saliva
**Saliva** is a digestive juice produced by <span class="hi-blue">salivary glands</span> in the mouth.
- It mixes with food during [[ingestion]] as food is cut into smaller pieces by teeth, and they are rolled into a mass called <span class="hi-blue">bolus</span> by the tongue.

*Composition*:
- **Water**: <span class="hi-green">Moistens and softens food</span> (99.5% of saliva is water)
- **Salivary amylase**: Catalyses the <span class="hi-green">breakdown of starch into maltose</span>
- **Mineral salts**: Maintains a <u>slightly alkaline pH</u> (~7.5) for the <span class="hi-green">optimum action of salivary amylase</span>
- **Mucus**: <span class="hi-green">Sticks food pieces together</span> and <span class="hi-green">lubricates the food</span> to make it easier to swallow

# Swallowing of food
The bolus is swallowed through the pharynx into oesophagus by a series of actions that ensures the food enters the oesophagus but not the trachea or nasal cavity.

*Series of actions*:
1. Tongue rises to force the bolus to the back of the mouth cavity.
2. Soft palate is pushed upward to close the nasal cavity at the back.
3. Larynx moves upward and forward. Epiglottis covers the entrance to the trachea, preventing the bolus from entering the trachea.

The beginning of the swallowing process is <span class="hi-blue">voluntary</span>. It becomes an <span class="hi-blue">automatic reflex action</span> once the bolus reaches the back of the mouth.

# Peristalsis
**Peristalsis** is a physical digestion process where <u>waves of alternative muscle contractions</u> that <span class="hi-green">push the bolus</span> along the entire canal and helps <span class="hi-green">mix food with digestive juices</span> to speed up digestion.

*Smooth muscles in the wall of the alimentary canal*:
- **Outer longitudinal muscles**: Run along the canal
- **Inner circular muscles**: Run along the canal
