In humans, teeth are embedded in the upper jaw and lower jaw. They are responsible for <span style="color: violet">mastication</span> during [[ingestion]].

# Structure
![[teeth_structure.avif]]
## Enamel
- <span class="hi-blue">Non-living part</span> that forms the majority of the crown.
- Made of mostly <span class="hi-blue">calcium salts</span>, the hardest substance in the human body.
- <span class="hi-green">Protects the teeth from wear</span> during biting and chewing.

## Cementum
- A thin layer that <u>replaces the enamel at the root of the teeth</u>.
- <u>Fixes the teeth into the jawbone</u> through the periodontal membrane.
- <span class="hi-green">Allows the teeth to move slightly and acts as a shock-absorber.</span>

## Dentine
- A <span class="hi-blue">bone-like, living layer</span> slightly harder than the cementum, but not as hard as the enamel.
- Contains numerous <span class="hi-green">small canals with extensions of the cells in the pulp cavity</span>.

## Pulp cavity
The structure contains:
- <span class="hi-blue">Living cells</span> that <span class="hi-green">produce dentine</span>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Blood vessels</span> to <span class="hi-green">supply oxygen and nutrients</span> to the living tissues and remove waste products (e.g. carbon dioxide).
- <span class="hi-blue">Nerve endings</span> for <span class="hi-green">sensing</span> (hot and cold) to achieve protection.

# Types
## Incisor
- **Location**: At the front of the jaw
- **Features**:
	- Chisel-shaped
	- With flat sharp edges
	- <span class="hi-green">With one root</span>
- **Functions**: Biting and cutting food

## Canine
- **Location**: Next to the incisors
- **Features**:
	- Pointed
	- <span class="hi-green">With one root</span>
- **Functions**: Tearing food (especially flesh)

## Premolar
- **Location**: At the sides of each jaw, behind the canine
- **Features**:
	- Broad top with <span class="hi-green">two cusps</span>
	- <span class="hi-green">With one or two roots</span>
- **Functions**: Crushing and grinding food

## Molar
- **Location**: At the back of each jaw, behind the premolars
- **Features**:
	- Larger than premolars
	- Broad top with <span class="hi-green">four cusps</span>
	- <span class="hi-green">With two or three roots</span>
- **Functions**: Crushing and grinding food

# Dentition and dental formula
**Dentition** describes the number and arrangement of different types of teeth in a mammal. It can be expressed as a <span class="hi-blue">dental formula</span> showing the types and numbers of teeth on one side of the upper and lower jaws.

![[dentition1.avif|360]]

*Example of a dental formula of a human adult*:
$\text{i}{2\over1}, \text{c}{1\over1}, \text{pm}{2\over2}, \text{m}{3\over3}$  (or $2123\over2123$)

> [!tip] Calculating number of teeth
> The total number of teeth is calculated by multiplying the sum of the denominator and numerator by 2. â†’ *(denominator + numerator) x 2 = total number of teeth*

## Milk teeth and permanent teeth
- **Milk teeth**: Appear between the ages of 6 months and 2.5 years.
  Gradually fall out and are replaced by permanent teeth between ages 6 and 12.

- **Permanent teeth**: Function for most of our lifetime.
  Cannot be replaced by new teeth if damaged or lost.

|                     | Incisors | Canines | Premolars | Molars | Total number |
| :-----------------: | :------: | :-----: | :-------: | :----: | :----------: |
|   **Milk teeth**    |    8     |    4    |   **0**   |   8    |      20      |
| **Permanent teeth** |    8     |    4    |     8     |   12   |      32      |
- There are <span class="hi-green">no premolars</span> in milk teeth, and <span class="hi-green">less molars</span>.

## Wisdom teeth
Wisdom teeth are the <span class="hi-green">third molars and the last teeth to erupt</span>, between the ages 16 and 25. Humans have four wisdom teeth (two on each side of the upper and lower jaws). <u>They may not erupt properly and become impacted, so they are commonly surgically removed.</u>
