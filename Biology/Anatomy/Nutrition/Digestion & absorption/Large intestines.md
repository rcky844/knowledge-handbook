- <u>Undigested materials</u> from the small intestine reaches the <span class="color: hi-blue">caecum</span>.
- <span class="color: hi-blue">Colon</span> absorbs more water, minerals and some vitamins from the remaining undigested materials.

# Egestion
**Egestion**, or **defecation**, occurs at the rectum and anus to expel <span class="color: hi-blue">faeces</span>.
- Rectum acts as temporary storage before it is expelled.

*Contents of faeces*:
- Contains mainly dietary fibres, bile pigments, mucus, dead cells from linings and large numbers of bacteria.
- All of the digested food and most of the water have been absorbed.

*Process*:
- Rings of muscles called <span class="color: hi-blue">anal sphincters</span> control the removal of faeces.
- When the anal sphincters relax, muscles of the rectum contract.

> [!warning]
> Egestion should not be confused with [[Characteristics of Life#Excretion|excretion]]. Undigested materials that are <u>not metabolic wastes</u>.
