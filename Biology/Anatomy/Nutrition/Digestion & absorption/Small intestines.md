# Digestion
The duodenum secretes <span class="hi-blue">intestine juice</span> and receives <span class="hi-blue">bile and pancreatic juice</span>.

[[Mouth cavity and oesophagus#Peristalsis|Peristalsis]] of the small intestine helps to mix food with digestive juice and increase the chance of contact with enzymes on epithelial cells with food molecules. The result is a <span class="hi-green">watery emulsion</span> called <span class="hi-blue">chyle</span>.

## Bile
*Contents*:
- **Bile salts**: <span class="hi-blue">Emulsify lipids</span> (breaking down fat into very small oil droplets)
	- <span class="hi-green">Increases the surface area</span> of lipids for the <u>action of the enzyme lipase</u>.
- **Sodium hydrogencarbonate**: Makes the bile alkaline
	- <span class="hi-green"Neutralizes the acidic chyme</span> from the stomach.
	- <span class="hi-green">Provides alkaline pH</span> (7.6 ~ 8.6) for <u>intestine enzymes</u>.
- **Bile pigments**: Green, break down products of haemoglobin from <span class="hi-blue">red blood cells</span>

> [!warning]
> - The bile contains <span class="hi-green">no digestive enzymes</span>.
> - Emulsification of lipids is caused by bile salts, and is a physical process.

*Secretion*:
- After bile is produced in the liver, it is temporarily stored in the <span class="hi-blue">gall bladder</span>.
- When fatty food is present in the duodenum, the <span class="hi-green">gall bladder contracts to release a large quantity</span> of it into the duodenum.

> [!tip]
> When the gall bladder is removed surgically, <u>bile flows directly into the duodenum</u>, <span class="hi-green">small amounts of bile may not be sufficient for effective digestion of lipids</span>. This may result in malabsorption and fatty faeces (steatorrhea).

## Pancreatic juice
*Contents*:
- **Sodium hydrogencarbonate**
- **Pancreatic amylase**: Catalyses the <span class="hi-green">breakdown of starch</span> in chyme into <span class="hi-blue">maltose</span>
- **Lipase**: Catalyses the <span class="hi-green">breakdown of lipids</span> into <span class="hi-blue">fatty acids and glycogen</span>
- **Proteases**: Catalyses the <span class="hi-green">breakdown of proteins</span> into <span class="hi-blue">peptides and amino acids</span>

## Intestinal juice
*Contents*:
- **Water, mucus, sodium hydrogencarbonate**
- **Carbohydrase**: Catalyses the <span class="hi-green">breakdown of disaccharides</span> into <span class="hi-blue">monosaccharides</span>
- **Proteases**: Catalyses the <span class="hi-green">breakdown of peptides</span> into <span class="hi-blue">amino acids</span>

*Secretion*:
![[intestinal_juice_secretion.avif|180]]
- Present on the <u>cell membrane of the epithelial cells of duodenum and the first part of the ileum</u>.
- Secreted by <span class="hi-green">glands in the wall of the small intestine</span>.

# Absorption
The small intestine is also <span class="hi-green">responsible for most of the absorption</span> process. It <u>absorbs the most amount of water, monosaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol</u>.

## Adaptations
1. **The small intestine is very long.**
   This <span class="hi-green">allows sufficient time for the complete digestion and absorption of food</span> as it passed along the small intestine.

2. **There are many projections on intestinal wall and surface of epithelial cells.**
	- Finger-like projections called <span class="hi-blue">villi</span> are present on intestinal walls. They are <span class="hi-green">formed by the higher folded inner surface</span> of the small intestine.
	- Numerous projections (<span class="hi-blue">microvilli</span>) also exists on the surface of epithelial cells of the villi.
	- They <span class="hi-green">increases the surface area for absorption</span>.
****
3. **Epithelium of each villus is one-cell thick.**
   This <span class="hi-green">shortens the distance for transport of food molecules</span>.

4. **Epithelium cells of each villi contains many mitochondria.**
   This provides energy for the [[active transport]] of certain food molecules.

5. **Each villus has a lymph vessel called lacteal, which is surrounded by a dense network of blood capillaries.**
	- The lacteal carries away <span class="hi-blue">lipids</span>, while blood capillaries carry away <span class="hi-blue">sugars and amino acids</span>.
	- This <span class="hi-green">maintains a steep concentration gradient</span> for rapid absorption.

6. **Villi are in constant motion due to peristalsis of the muscular wall.**
   This brings the digested <u>food molecules into close contact with villi</u> and <span class="hi-green">reduces the distance for diffusion for rapid absorption</span>.

## Transport of food molecules
*Into the blood*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Small, water-soluble molecules</span> (e.g. monosaccharides, amino acids, minerals and certain vitamins) are absorbed through the epithelium of villi into blood capillaries by [[diffusion]] and [[active transport]].
- <span class="hi-green">Absorption of digested food into the blood decreases the water potential of the blood.</span>, resulting in 80% of the <span class="hi-blue">water</span> from chyme being absorbed in the small intestine into the blood by [[osmosis]].

*Into the lymph*: Diffusion
- <span class="hi-blue">Fatty acids and glycerol</span> first pass into the <span class="hi-blue">epithelial cells of villi</span>.
- They are then <span class="hi-green">recombined inside the cells to form small oil droplets</span>, and then passed out of the cell to enter the lacteal.
- Oil droplets are then carried by the <span class="hi-blue">lymph</span> in the lymphatic system and eventually enter the bloodstream.
