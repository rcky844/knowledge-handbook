The **alimentary canal** is the pathway by which the food we eat passes from mouth to anus for further process of digestion. It starts at the mouth and ends at the anus, receiving <span class="hi-blue">digestive juices</span> secreted by <span class="hi-green">salivary glands, gastric glands, the liver, the pancreas and intestinal glands</span>.

*Path taken for digestion of food*:
mouth cavity → oesophagus → stomach → duodenum → ileum → caecum → colon → rectum → anus
