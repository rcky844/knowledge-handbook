# Transport of food substances
![[assimilation_route.avif|450]]

*Routes for transport from small intestine*:
- Monosaccharides, amino acids and other water-soluble food substances are transported to the liver by blood through the hepatic portal vein.
- Lipids are transported by the lymph in the [[lymphatic system]] and empties into blood vessels near the heart.

*Usage of food substances*:
- The liver may store or process food molecules, it returns to the bloodstream through the hepatic vein when released from the liver.
- All absorbed food molecules finally enter the bloodstream and are transported to different parts of the body for [[respiration]] to release energy or storage.

# Functions of the liver
1. **Regulation of blood glucose level**
   The liver removes excess glucose from the blood and converts it into glycogen. Glycogen can be converted back to glucose when blood glucose level falls below a normal range.

2. **Deamination of excess amino acids**
   ![[Deamination]]

3. **Production of bile**
   Produces bile from breaking down red blood cells to help speed up the digestion of lipids.

4. **Storage of glycogen, iron and fat-soluble vitamins**
	- Store excess carbohydrates as glycogen as 'short-term' energy reserve.
	- Store iron from broken down old red blood cells and can be used to make new red blood cells.
	- Store fat-soluble vitamins (e.g. vitamins A and D) and carotene (can be converted to vitamin A).

5. **Detoxification**
   Converts certain toxic substances (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, drugs) in the blood into harmless substances. Wastes formed are excreted in urine or bile.
