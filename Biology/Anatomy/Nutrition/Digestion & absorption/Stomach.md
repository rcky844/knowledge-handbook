## Sphincters
- **Cardiac sphincter** is a <u>circular sphincter muscle</u> located at the entrance of the stomach to control the <span class="hi-green">entry of food</span> and <span class="hi-green">prevent food from flowing back up the oesophagus</span>.
- **Pyloric sphincter** is a <u>circular sphincter muscle</u> located at the exit of the stomach to control the <span class="hi-green">exit of food</span> to the duodenum.

## Stomach wall
*Features*:
- It is <span class="hi-blue">folded and elastic</span>. The folds can <span class="hi-green">spread out to increase the volume of the stomach</span> when it fills with food.

*Secretions*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Gastric glands</span> in the inner wall secretes <span class="hi-blue">gastric juice</span>.
- <span class="hi-green">Secretes mucus</span> which covers its inner surface, forming a <u>physical barrier</u> to prevent the acid and digestive enzymes from damaging itself.

*Composition of gastric juice*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Enzyme pepsin</span>, a type of protease that catalyses the <span class="hi-green">breakdown of proteins into peptides</span>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Hydrochloric acid</span>.
	- <span class="hi-green">Provides an acidic medium</span> (pH ~2) for proteases to work optimally.
	- <span class="hi-green">Denatures proteins</span> in foods by unfolding the three-dimensional shapes of protein molecules, making it easier to digest.
	- <span class="hi-green">Kills most of the bacteria</span> taken in with food.

# Churning
**Churning** are <u>rhythmic contractions</u> of the stomach wall stimulated by the arrival of the bolus.
- The bolus is <span class="hi-green">churned and mixed with gastric juice</span>.
- Results in a semi-liquid paste of <span class="hi-green">partially digested food</span> called <span class="hi-blue">chyme</span>.
- A <span class="hi-green">small amount</span> of chyme is released into the duodenum through the pyloric sphincter at a time.
