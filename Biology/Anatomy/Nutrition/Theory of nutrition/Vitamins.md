- <span class="hi-blue">Osteoporosis</span> (weakens bones in adults)

# Vitamin E
*Food sources*:
nuts, cereals

*Functions*:
- Protects cells against damage by <span class="hi-blue">free radicals</span>

*Deficiency symptoms / diseases*:
- Anaemia due to excessive breakdown of red blood cells
- Damage to nerve cells

# Vitamin K
