*Pre-context: [[Carbohydrates]]*

**Carbohydrates** can be used by the human body as a <u>source of energy</u> (1 g â†’ 17.1 kJ). When it is in excess, they are <span class="hi-green">stored as glycogen or lipids in the body</span>.

<span class="hi-green">Monosaccharides are readily absorbed</span> in the [[small intestines]], while <span class="hi-green">disaccharides and polysaccharides must be broken down</span> into monosaccharides before absorption as they are <span class="hi-blue">too large to be absorbed directly</span>.

# Types of carbohydrates

> For example, consider the word fructose & maltose:

> subgraph English
> 	E[-ose];
> end
> 
> W[fructose];
> L --> W;
> E --> W;

> 	L[malt<br>germinating barley];

## Monosaccharides
*Food sources*:
- **Glucose & fructose**: fruit and honey
- **Galactose**: diary products

*Functions*:
- **Glucose** acts as a [[Respiration|respiratory]] substrate.

## Disaccharides
*Food sources*:
- **Maltose**: germinating barley
- **Sucrose**: sugar cane, sugar beet, table sugar
- **Lactose**: milk, dairy products

## Polysaccharides
*Food sources*:
- **Starch**: cereals (e.g. rice, wheat, barley and oats), maize, potatoes, taros

*Functions*:
- **Glycogen** is for energy storage in animals.
- **Cellulose** from vegetables is a source of [[Dietary fibres]].
