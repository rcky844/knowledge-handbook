**Balanced diet** provides us with enough energy and nutrients for maintaining [[metabolism]] (including growth), <span class="hi-green">muscle contractions</span> when performing physical activities, and <span class="hi-green">generating heat</span> to keep the body temperature constant.

The **food pyramid** is a guide containing a variety of food substances in the <span class="hi-green">right amounts and proportions</span> to help achieve a balanced diet.

# Factors influencing dietary requirements
1. **Age and growth**
	- <span class="hi-green">Children and teenagers</span> require a <span class="hi-blue">higher proportion of proteins</span>, as they are in a [[Growth and development in humans|stage of rapid development]] with higher metabolic rate.
	- They also <span class="hi-blue">lose heat faster</span>, as they have a larger surface area to volume ratio than adults.
	- They have <u>higher energy requirement per unit body mass</u>, diet should include relative large amounts of energy-rich food.

2. **Activity levels**
	- Individuals who perform <span class="hi-green">heavy physical activities</span> require more energy for movement as <u>muscles are contracting more and respiring faster</u>.
	- They need a diet rich in <span class="hi-blue">carbohydrates and proteins</span>.

3. **Body status**
	- *Pregnancy*: Extra <span class="hi-blue">carbohydrates, proteins, minerals (e.g. calcium) and vitamins</span> are needed to support the <span class="hi-green">growth and development of the fetus</span> and the larger mass of the mother.
	- *Breastfeeding*: Extra energy and calcium is needed to produce high-quality <span class="hi-green">breast milk</span>.
	- *Higher muscle mass*: <span class="hi-green">Larger body size and more muscle mass</span> results in a higher metabolic rate in males than females and requires more energy and proteins.

# Malnutrition and health issues
*See also: [[Body mass index]]*

## Undernutrition
**Undernutrition** (starvation) is when the <span class="hi-green">energy intake</span> (from food) <span class="hi-green">is lower than energy expenditure</span> (over a long period). It may occur during <span class="hi-blue">fasting</span>.

*Effects*:
- The body first mobilise <span class="hi-blue">glycogen</span> in <span class="hi-orange">liver and skeletal muscles</span> as energy source.
- Then, <span class="hi-blue">subcutaneous fat</span> is broken down, which results in severe weight loss.
- Eventually, <span class="hi-blue">muscle proteins</span> are broken down, which can result in <span class="hi-green">damage to the heart and immune system</span>, increasing the risk of diseases.

> [!tip] Carbohydrates malnutrition
> A **low carbohydrate diet** reduces the <span class="hi-blue">glycogen store</span> of the body, which forces the body to <span class="hi-green">increase usage of fat and proteins</span> for metabolism, while people may feel tired easily as fat and protein breakdown is a slow process.

> [!tip] Protein malnutrition
> **Kwashiorkor** is a disease caused by <u>severe protein deficiency</u> in the diet. This is common in children under two, and they are always underweight and often have a <span class="hi-green">swollen abdomen</span>.

## Overnutrition
**Overnutrition** is when the <span class="hi-green">energy intake</span> (from food) <span class="hi-green">is higher than energy expenditure</span>. Common causes are when people ear too much or <span class="hi-orange">lack sufficient physical activity</span>.

*Effects*:
- Extra energy is <span class="hi-green">stored as fat</span>, resulting in <span class="hi-blue">weight gain and obesity</span>.
- Obesity contributes to the development of diseases such as [[Cardiovascular diseases|heart disease]] and [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].

## Constipation
**Constipation** is caused by the lack of [[dietary fibres]] in the diet.

*Effects*:
- Food lacks bulk for muscles to push it through the alimentary canal, the person develops <span class="hi-green">uncomfortable or infrequent bowel movements</span>.
- The chance for developing diseases like <span class="hi-blue">bowel cancer</span> are increased.
