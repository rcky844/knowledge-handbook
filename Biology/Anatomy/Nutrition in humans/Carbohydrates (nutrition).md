**Carbohydrates** can be used by the human body as a source of energy. (1 g â†’ 17.1 kJ). When it is in excess, they are stored as glycogen or lipids in the body.

Monosaccharides are readily absorbed in the small intestines, while disaccharides and polysaccharides must be broken down into monosaccharides before absorption as they are too large to be absorbed directly.

##### Monosaccharides
**Food sources**:
- Glucose & fructose: fruit and honey
- Galactose: diary products

**Functions**:
- Glucose acts as a [[Respiration|respiratory]] substrate.

##### Disaccharides

- Lactose: milk, dairy products

##### Polysaccharides
**Food sources**:
- Starch: cereals (e.g. rice, wheat, barley and oats), maize, potatoes, taros

**Functions**:
- Glycogen is for energy storage in animals.
