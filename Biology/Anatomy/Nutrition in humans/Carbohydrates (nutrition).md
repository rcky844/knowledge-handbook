**Carbohydrates** can be used by the human body as a <span style="color: lightgreen">source of energy</span> <u>(1 g â†’ 17.1 kJ)</u>. When it is in excess, they are <span style="color: lightgreen">stored as glycogen or lipids in the body</span>.

<span style="color: lightgreen">Monosaccharides are readily absorbed</span> in the small intestines, while <span style="color: lightgreen">disaccharides and polysaccharides must be broken down</span> into monosaccharides before absorption as they are <span style="color: aqua">too large to be absorbed directly</span>.

#### Types of carbohydrates

> [!tip] Naming of sugars and their functions
> For example, consider the word fructose & maltose:
> ```mermaid

> subgraph Latin
> 	L[fructus<br>fruit'];
> end
> 
> subgraph English
> 	E[-ose];
> end
> 
> W[fructose];
> L --> W;
> E --> W;
> ```
> ```mermaid
> flowchart LR
> subgraph English
> 	L[malt<br>germinating barley];
> 	E[-ose];
> end
> 
> W[maltose];
> L --> W;
> E --> W;
> ```

##### Monosaccharides
**Food sources**:
- Glucose & fructose: fruit and honey
- Galactose: diary products

**Functions**:
- Glucose acts as a [[Respiration|respiratory]] substrate.

##### Disaccharides
**Food sources**:
- Maltose: germinating barley
- Sucrose: sugar cane, sugar beet, table sugar
- Lactose: milk, dairy products

##### Polysaccharides
**Food sources**:
- Starch: cereals (e.g. rice, wheat, barley and oats), maize, potatoes, taros

**Functions**:
- Glycogen is for energy storage in animals.
- Cellulose from vegetables is a source of [[Dietary fibres]].
