The food pyramid is a guide containing a variety of food substances in the right amounts and proportions to help achieve a balanced diet.

**Balanced diet** provides us with enough energy and nutrients for maintaining metabolism (including growth), muscle contractions when performing physical activities, and generating heat to keep the body temperature constant.

#### Factors influencing dietary requirements
Dietary requirements (energy and nutrients) varies from person to person.

1. **Age**
   Children have a <u>higher metabolic rate</u> (stage of rapid development) and <u>lose heat faster</u> (larger surface area to volume ratio than adults). As they have higher energy requirement per unit body mass, diet should include relative large amounts of energy-rich food.

2. **Gender and body size**
	- Males have larger body size and more muscle mass, resulting in a higher metabolic rate than females and requires more energy and proteins.
	- Females need more iron to compensate for the iron lost each month in menstrual blood.

3. **Level of physical activity**
   People who perform heavy physical activities (e.g. construction worker, professional athlete) need a diet rich in carbohydrates and proteins.

4. **Body status**
	- Pregnant women need more carbohydrates, proteins and a range of vitamins and minerals to support the growth and development of the fetus.
	- Breast-feeding mothers need nutrients for milk production.

#### Malnutrition and health issues

##### Undernutrition
Undernutrition occurs when energy intake from food is lower than energy output. It may occur during <u>fasting</u>.

During this condition, our bodies will use (1) <u>glycogen in liver and skeletal muscles</u> and (2) <u>subcutaneous fat</u>, causing weight loss. Prolonged starvation and the absence of fat reserves will cause our bodies to use (3) <u>muscle proteins</u> as a source of energy.

Severe protein deficiency can lead to kwashiorkor, symptoms include stunted growth, anaemia, hair loss, swollen belly (tissue fluid accumulates in the abdomen).

##### Overnutrition
Overnutrition occurs when energy intake from food is higher than energy output. It may occur when the person heat too much or lack sufficient physical activity.

During this condition, out bodies will store the excess as fat and cause weight gain. Serious condition of overweight is obesity which leads to high blood pressure, heart diseases, diabetes, gallstones or serious damage to the joints.
