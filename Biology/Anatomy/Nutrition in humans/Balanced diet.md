**Balanced diet** provides us with enough energy and nutrients for maintaining metabolism (including growth), muscle contractions when performing physical activities, and generating heat to keep the body temperature constant.

The **food pyramid** is a guide containing a variety of food substances in the right amounts and proportions to help achieve a balanced diet.

#### Factors influencing dietary requirements
1. **Age**
   <span style="color: lightgreen">Children have a higher metabolic rate</span> (stage of rapid development) and <span style="color: lightgreen">lose heat faster</span> (larger surface area to volume ratio than adults). As they have higher energy requirement per unit body mass, diet should include relative large amounts of energy-rich food.

2. **Gender and body size**
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">Males have larger body size and more muscle mass</span>, resulting in a higher metabolic rate than females and requires more energy and proteins.
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">Females need more iron</span> to compensate for the iron lost each month in <span style="color: violet">menstrual blood</span>.

3. **Level of physical activity**
   People who perform heavy physical activities (e.g. construction worker, professional athlete) need a diet rich in carbohydrates and proteins.

4. **Body status**
	- Pregnant women need more carbohydrates, proteins and a range of vitamins and minerals to support the growth and development of the fetus.
	- Breast-feeding mothers need nutrients for milk production.

#### Malnutrition and health issues

##### Undernutrition
**Undernutrition** occurs when energy intake from food is lower than energy output. It may occur during <span style="color: aqua">fasting</span>.

During this condition, our bodies will use (1) <span style="color: lightgreen">glycogen in liver and skeletal muscles</span> and (2) <span style="color: lightgreen">subcutaneous fat</span>, causing weight loss. Prolonged starvation and the absence of fat reserves will cause our bodies to use (3) <span style="color: lightgreen">muscle proteins</span> as a source of energy.

Severe protein deficiency can lead to <span style="color: violet">kwashiorkor</span>, symptoms include stunted growth, anaemia, hair loss, <u>swollen belly</u> (tissue fluid accumulates in the abdomen).

##### Overnutrition
**Overnutrition** occurs when energy intake from food is higher than energy output. It may occur when the person <span style="color: aqua">eat too much or lack sufficient physical activity</span>.

During this condition, out bodies will <span style="color: lightgreen">store the excess as fat and cause weight gain</span>. Serious condition of overweight is obesity which leads to high blood pressure, heart diseases, diabetes, gallstones or serious damage to the joints.
