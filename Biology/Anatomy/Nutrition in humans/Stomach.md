##### Cardiac sphincter
- <span style="color: violet">Circular sphincter muscle</span>
- Controls the <span style="color: lightgreen">entry of food</span> (located at the entrance)
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Prevents food from going back to the oesophagus</span>

##### Pyloric sphincter
- <span style="color: violet">Circular sphincter muscle</span>
- Controls the <span style="color: lightgreen">exit of food</span> to the duodenum (located at the exit)

##### Stomach wall
- <span style="color: aqua">Folded and elastic</span>
	- When the stomach fills with food, <span style="color: lightgreen">the folds can spread out to increase the volume of the stomach</span>.
- Gastric glands in the inner wall secretes gastric juice, containing:
	- <span style="color: violet">Enzyme pepsin</span>, a type of <span style="color: lightgreen">protease that catalyses the breakdown of proteins into peptides</span>.
	- <span style="color: violet">Hydrochloric acid</span>
		- <span style="color: lightgreen">Provides an acidic medium</span> (pH ~2) for proteases to work optimally.
		- <span style="color: lightgreen">Denatures proteins</span> in foods by unfolding the three-dimensional shapes of protein molecules, making it easier to digest.
		- <span style="color: lightgreen">Kills most of the bacteria</span> taken in with food.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Secretes mucus</span> which covers its inner surface, forming a <u>physical barrier</u> to prevent the acid and digestive enzymes from damaging itself.

#### Churning
Arrival of the bolus stimulates the wall to begin <span style="color: aqua">rhythmic contractions</span> called **churning**.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">The bolus is churned and mixed with gastric juice.</span>
- Results in a <span style="color: lightgreen">semi-liquid paste of partially digested food</span> called <span style="color: violet">chyme</span>.
- A <span style="color: lightgreen">small amount</span> of chyme is released into the duodenum through the pyloric sphincter at a time.
