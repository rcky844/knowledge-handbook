##### Cardiac sphincter
- Circular sphincter muscle
- Controls the entry of food (located at the entrance)
- Prevents food from going back to the oesophagus

##### Pyloric sphincter
- Circular sphincter muscle
- Controls the exit to the duodenum (located at the exit)

##### Stomach wall
- Folded and elastic
- When the stomach fills with food, the folds spread out so that the volume of the stomach increases.
- Gastric glands in the inner wall secretes gastric juice, containing:
	- Enzyme pepsin, a type of protease that catalyses the breakdown of proteins into peptides.
	- Hydrochloric acid
		- Provides an acidic medium (pH ~2) for proteases to work optimally.
		- Denatures proteins in foods by unfolding the three-dimensional shapes of protein molecules, making it easier to digest.
		- Kills most of the bacteria taken in with food.
- Secretes mucus which covers its inner surface, forming a physical barrier to prevent the acid and digestive enzymes from damaging itself.

#### Churning
Arrival of the bolus stimulates the wall to begin rhythmic contractions called **churning**.
- The bolus is churned and mixed with gastric juice.
- Results in a semi-liquid paste of partially digested food called chyme.
- A small amount of chyme is released into the duodenum through the pyloric sphincter at a time.
