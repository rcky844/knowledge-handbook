#### Digestion
The duodenum secretes intestine juice and receives bile and pancreatic juice.

##### Bile
**Contents**:
- **Bile salts**: <span style="color: lightgreen">Emulsify lipids</span> (breaking down fat into very small oil droplets)
	- <span style="color: aqua">Increases the surface area</span> of lipids for the <u>action of the enzyme lipase</u>.
- **Sodium hydrogencarbonate**: <span style="color: lightgreen">Makes the bile alkaline</span>
	- <span style="color: aqua">Neutralizes the acidic chyme</span> from the stomach.
	- <span style="color: aqua">Provides alkaline pH</span> (7.6 ~ 8.6) for <u>intestine enzymes</u>.
- **Bile pigments**: Green, break down products of haemoglobin from <span style="color: violet">red blood cells</span>

> [!warning]
> - The bile contains <u>no digestive enzymes</u>.
> - Emulsification of lipids is caused by bile salts, and is a physical process.

**Secretion**:
After bile is produced in the liver, it is <span style="color: aqua">temporarily stored in the gall bladder</span>. When fatty food is present in the duodenum, the <span style="color: lightgreen">gall bladder contracts to release a large quantity</span> of it into the duodenum.

> [!tip]
> When the gall bladder is removed surgically, <u>bile flows directly into the duodenum</u>, <span style="color: lightgreen">small amounts of bile may not be sufficient for effective digestion of lipids</span>. This may result in malabsorption and fatty faeces (steatorrhea).

##### Pancreatic juice
**Contents**:
- **Sodium hydrogencarbonate**
- **Pancreatic amylase**: Catalyses the <span style="color: lightgreen">breakdown of starch</span> in chyme into <span style="color: violet">maltose</span>
- **Lipase**: Catalyses the <span style="color: lightgreen">breakdown of lipids</span> into <span style="color: violet">fatty acids and glycogen</span>
- **Proteases**: Catalyses the <span style="color: lightgreen">breakdown of proteins</span> into <span style="color: violet">peptides and amino acids</span>

##### Intestinal juice
**Contents**:
- **Water, mucus, sodium hydrogencarbonate**
- **Carbohydrase**: Catalyses the <span style="color: lightgreen">breakdown of disaccharides</span> into <span style="color: violet">monosaccharides</span>
- **Proteases**: Catalyses the <span style="color: lightgreen">breakdown of peptides</span> into <span style="color: violet">amino acids</span>

**Secretion**:
![[intestinal_juice_secretion.avif|180]]
- Present on the <span style="color: aqua">cell membrane of the epithelial cells of duodenum</span>.
- Secreted by <span style="color: aqua">glands in the wall of the small intestine</span>, especially in the <u>duodenum and the first part of the ileum</u>.

[[Mouth cavity and oesophagus#Peristalsis|Peristalsis]] of the small intestine helps to mix food with digestive juice and increase the chance of contact with enzymes on epithelial cells with food molecules. This results in a <span style="color: lightgreen">watery emulsion</span> called <span style="color: violet">chyle</span>.

#### Absorption
The small intestine is also <span style="color: lightgreen">responsible for most of the absorption</span> process. It <u>absorbs the most amount of water, monosaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol</u>.

##### Adaptations
1. **The small intestine is very long.**
   This <span style="color: lightgreen">allows sufficient time for the complete digestion and absorption of food</span> as it passed along the small intestine.

2. **There are many projections on intestinal wall and surface of epithelial cells.**
	- Finger-like projections called <span style="color: violet">villi</span> are present on intestinal walls. They are <span style="color: aqua">formed by the higher folded inner surface</span> of the small intestine.
	- Numerous projections (<span style="color: violet">microvilli</span>) also exists on the surface of epithelial cells of the villi.
	- They <span style="color: lightgreen">increases the surface area for absorption</span>.

3. **Epithelium of each villus is one-cell thick.**
   This <span style="color: lightgreen">shortens the distance for transport of food molecules</span>.

4. **Epithelium cells of each villi contains many mitochondria.**
   This <span style="color: lightgreen">provides energy</span> for the [[active transport]] of certain food molecules.

5. **Each villus has a lymph vessel called lacteal, which is surrounded by a dense network of blood capillaries.**
	- <span style="color: aqua">The lacteal carries away lipids, while blood capillaries carry away sugars and amino acids.</span>
	- This <span style="color: lightgreen">maintains a steep concentration gradient for rapid absorption</span>.

6. **Villi are in constant motion due to peristalsis of the muscular wall.**
   This brings the digested <u>food molecules into close contact with villi</u> and <span style="color: lightgreen">reduces the distance for diffusion for rapid absorption</span>.

##### Transport of food molecules
Food molecules are transported by [[diffusion]], [[osmosis]] and [[active transport]].

**Into the blood**:
- **Diffusion and active transport**
  <span style="color: violet">Small, water-soluble molecules</span> (e.g. monosaccharides, amino acids, minerals and certain vitamins) are absorbed through the <span style="color: aqua">epithelium of villi into blood capillaries</span>.
- **Osmosis**
  <span style="color: lightgreen">Absorption of digested food into the blood decreases the water potential of the blood.</span> About 80% of the <span style="color: violet">water</span> from chyme is absorbed in the small intestine into the blood.

**Into the lymph**:
- **Diffusion**
	- <span style="color: violet">Fatty acids and glycerol</span> first pass into the <span style="color: skyblue">epithelial cells of villi</span>.
	- They are then <span style="color: lightgreen">recombined inside the cells to form small oil droplets</span>, and then passed out of the cell to enter the lacteal.
	- Oil droplets are then carried by the lymph in the lymphatic system and eventually enter the bloodstream.
