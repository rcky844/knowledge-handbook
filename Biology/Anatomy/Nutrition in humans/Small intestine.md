#### Digestion
The duodenum secretes intestine juice and receives bile and pancreatic juice.

##### Bile
**Contents**:
- **Bile salts**: Emulsify lipids (breaking down fat into very small oil droplets)
	- Increases the surface area of lipids for the action of the enzyme lipase.
- **Sodium hydrogencarbonate**: Makes the bile alkaline
	- Neutralizes the acidic chyme from the stomach.
	- Provides alkaline pH (7.6 ~ 8.6) for intestine enzymes.
- **Bile pigments**: Green, break down products of haemoglobin from red blood cells
Note that bile contains <u>no digestive enzymes</u>!

**Secretion**:
After bile is produced in the liver, it is temporarily stored in the gall bladder. When fatty food is present in the duodenum, the gall bladder contracts to release a large quantity of it into the duodenum.

In cases where the gall bladder is removed surgically, bile flows directly into the duodenum, the small amounts of bile may not be sufficient for effective digestion of lipids.

##### Pancreatic juice
**Contents**:
- **Sodium hydrogencarbonate**
- **Pancreatic amylase**: Catalyses the breakdown of starch in chyme into maltose
- **Lipase**: Catalyses the breakdown of lipids into fatty acids and glycogen
- **Proteases**: Catalyses the breakdown of proteins into peptides and amino acids

##### Intestinal juice
**Contents**:
- **Water, mucus, sodium hydrogencarbonate**
- **Carbohydrase**: Catalyses the breakdown of disaccharides into monosaccharides
- **Proteases**: Catalyses the breakdown of peptides into amino acids.

**Secretion**:
![[intestinal_juice_secretion.avif|180]]
- Present on the cell membrane of the epithelial cells of duodenum.
- Secreted by glands in the wall of the small intestine, especially in the duodenum and the first part of the ileum.

Monosaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol are readily absorbed from the small intestine.

[[Mouth cavity and oesophagus#Peristalsis|Peristalsis]] of the small intestine helps to mix food with digestive juice and increase the chance of contact with enzymes on epithelial cells with food molecules. This results in a watery emulsion called chyle.

#### Absorption
The small intestine is also responsible for most of the absorption process. It absorbs the most amount of water and products of digestion.

##### Adaptations
1. The small intestine is very long.
   → Allows sufficient time for the complete digestion and absorption of food as it passed along the small intestine.

2. Numerous finger-like projections (villi) are present. They are formed by the higher folded inner surface of the small intestine. Numerous projections (microvilli) also exists on the surface of epithelial cells of the villi.
   → Increases the surface area for absorption.

3. Epithelium of each villus is one-cell thick.
   → Shortens the distance for transport of food molecules.

4. Epithelium cells of each villi contains many mitochondria.
   → Provides energy for the active transport of certain food molecules.

5. Each villus has a lymph vessel called lacteal, which is surrounded by a dense network of blood capillaries.
   → Maintains a steep concentration gradient for rapid absorption.
   → The lacteal carries away lipids, while blood capillaries carry away sugars and amino acids.

6. Villi are in constant motion due to peristalsis of the muscular wall.
   → Brings the digested food molecules into close contact with villi for rapid absorption.

##### Transport of food molecules
Via [[diffusion]], [[osmosis]] and [[active transport]].

**Into the blood**:
- **Diffusion and active transport**
  Small, water-soluble molecules (e.g. monosaccharides, amino acids, minerals and certain vitamins) are absorbed through the epithelium of villi into blood capillaries.
- **Osmosis**
  Absorption of digested food into the blood decreases the water potential of the blood. About 80% of the water from chyme is absorbed in the small intestine into the blood.

**Into the lymph**:
- **Diffusion**
  Fatty acids and glycerol pass into the epithelial cells of villi. They are recombined inside the cells to form small oil droplets, then passed out of the cell to enter the lacteal. Oil droplets are then carried by the lymph in the lymphatic system and eventually enter the bloodstream.
