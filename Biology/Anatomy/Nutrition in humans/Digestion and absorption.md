**Digestion** is a process by which large food molecules are broken down into smaller, soluble molecules. It begins in the mouth cavity, and continues in the stomach and the small intestine.

**Absorption** occurs in the small intestine and the large intestine.

#### Methods of digestion
##### Physical digestion
Breaking up of food into smaller pieces by physical means, without changing the chemical structure of food (and does not form new food substances). This increases the surface area of the food for the action of digestive [[Enzymes]].

**Examples**:
- **Chewing**: Teeth mechanically cuts food into smaller pieces and mix food with saliva during [[ingestion]].
- **[[Mouth cavity and oesophagus#Peristalsis|Peristalsis]]**: Waves of muscular contractions along the alimentary canal.
- **[[Stomach#Churning|Churning]]**: Rhythmic, muscular contractions of the stomach
- **Emulsification of lipids**: By [[Small intestine#Bile|bile salts]] in the small intestine

##### Chemical digestion
Breakdown of large, complex food molecules into small, simple molecules through chemical reactions (e.g. hydrolysis). Reactions are catalysed by digestive enzymes.
