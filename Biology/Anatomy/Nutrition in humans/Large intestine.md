The remaining <u>undigested materials</u> (not metabolic waste!) from the small intestine reaches the caecum. It passes along the colon where more water, minerals and some vitamins are absorbed from the remaining undigested materials.

#### Egestion
*Not to be confused with [[Characteristics of Life#Excretion|Excretion]].*

By the time food materials reach the rectum, all of the digested food and most of the water have been absorbed. The remaining undigested materials form **faeces**.

**Faeces** are semi-solid, greenish-brown mass that contains mainly dietary fibres, bile pigments, mucus, dead cells from the lining of the alimentary canal and a large number of bacteria. It is temporarily stored in the rectum before they are expelled through the anus.

**Egestion**, or **defecation**, occurs at the rectum and anus. Rings of muscles called anal sphincters control the removal of faeces. When the anal sphincters relax, muscles of the rectum contract. Faeces is expelled through the anus.
