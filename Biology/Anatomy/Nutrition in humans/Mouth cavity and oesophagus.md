#### Saliva
During [[ingestion]], food is cut into smaller pieces by teeth. **Saliva** then mixes with food and they are rolled into a mass called bolus by the tongue, where chemical digestion by the enzymes in the contents of saliva begins.

**Saliva** is a digestive juice produced by salivary glands in the mouth. It consists of:
- **Water**: Moistens and softens food (99.5% of saliva is water)
- **Salivary amylase**: Catalyses the breakdown of starch into maltose
- **Mineral salts**: Maintains a slightly alkaline pH (~7.5) for the optimum action of salivary amylase
- **Mucus**: Sticks food pieces together and lubricates the food to make it easier to swallow

#### Swallowing of food
After food is rolled into a mass called bolus, it is then swallow through the pharynx into the oesophagus. Food then pass over the entrance of the trachea by a series of actions that ensure the food enters the oesophagus and not the trachea or the nasal cavity.

Below describes the series of actions:
1. Tongue rises to force the bolus to the back of the mouth cavity.
2. Soft palate is pushed upward to close the nasal cavity at the back.
3. Larynx moves upward and forward. Epiglottis covers the entrance to the trachea, preventing the bolus from entering the trachea.

The beginning of the swallowing process is voluntary. It becomes an automatic reflex action once the bolus reaches the back of the mouth.

#### Peristalsis
**Peristalsis** are waves of alternative muscle contractions that push the bolus along the entire canal and part of physical digestion. It also helps mix food with digestive juices to speed up digestion.

Cross-section of the alimentary canal ⤴

There are two layers of smooth muscles in the wall of the alimentary canal:
- **Outer longitudinal muscles**: Run along the canal
- **Inner circular muscles**: Run along the canal
