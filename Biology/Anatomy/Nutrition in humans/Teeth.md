In humans, teeth are embedded in the upper jaw and lower jaw. They are responsible for mastication during [[ingestion]].

#### Structure
![[teeth_structure.avif]]
##### Enamel
- Non-living part that forms the majority of the crown.
- Made of mostly calcium salts, the hardest substance in the human body.
- Protects the teeth from wear during biting and chewing.

##### Cementum
- A thin layer that replaces the enamel at the root of the teeth.
- Fixes the teeth into the jawbone through the periodontal membrane.
- Allows the teeth to move slightly and acts as a shock-absorber.

##### Dentine
- A bone-like, living layer slightly harder than the cementum, but not as hard as the enamel.
- Contains numerous small canals with extensions of the cells in the pulp cavity.

##### Pulp cavity
The structure contains:
- **Living cells** that produce dentine.
- **Blood vessels** to supply oxygen and nutrients to the living tissues and remove waste products (e.g. carbon dioxide).
- **Nerve endings** for sensing (hot and cold) to achieve protection.

#### Types
##### Incisor
- **Location**: At the front of the jaw
- **Features**:
	- Chisel-shaped
	- With flat sharp edges
	- With one root
- **Functions**: Biting and cutting food

##### Canine
- **Location**: Next to the incisors
- **Features**:
	- Pointed
	- With one root
- **Functions**: Tearing food (especially flesh)

##### Premolar
- **Location**: At the sides of each jaw, behind the canine
- **Features**:
	- Broad top with two cusps
	- With one or two roots
- **Functions**: Crushing and grinding food

##### Molar
- **Location**: At the back of each jaw, behind the premolars
- **Features**:
	- Larger than premolars
	- Broad top with four cusps
	- With two or three roots
- **Functions**: Crushing and grinding food

#### Dentition and dental formula
**Dentition** describes the number and arrangement of different types of teeth in a mammal. It can be expressed as a **dental formula** showing the types and numbers of teeth on one side of the upper and lower jaws.

![[dentition1.avif|360]]

Below is an example of a dental formula of a human adult:
$\text{i}{2\over1}, \text{c}{1\over1}, \text{pm}{2\over2}, \text{m}{3\over3}$  (or $2123\over2123$)

The total number of teeth is calculated by multiplying the sum of the denominator and numerator by 2. â€” *(denominator + numerator) x 2 = total number of teeth*

##### Milk teeth and permanent teeth

- **Milk teeth**: Appear between the ages of 6 months and 2.5 years.
  Gradually fall out and are replaced by permanent teeth between the ages 6 and 12.
- **Permanent teeth**: Function for most of our lifetime.
  Cannot be replaced by new teeth if damaged or lost.

|                     | Incisors | Canines | Premolars | Molars | Total number |
| :-----------------: | :------: | :-----: | :-------: | :----: | :----------: |
|   **Milk teeth**    |    8     |    4    |   **0**   |   8    |      20      |
| **Permanent teeth** |    8     |    4    |     8     |   12   |      32      |

##### Wisdom teeth
Wisdom teeth are the third molars and the last teeth to erupt, between the ages
16 and 25. Humans have four wisdom teeth (two on each side of the upper and lower jaws). They may not erupt properly and become impacted, so they are commonly surgically removed.
