In humans, teeth are embedded in the upper jaw and lower jaw. They are responsible for <span style="color: violet">mastication</span> during [[ingestion]].

#### Structure
![[teeth_structure.avif]]
##### Enamel
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Non-living part</span> that forms the majority of the crown.
- Made of mostly <span style="color: lightgreen">calcium salts</span>, the hardest substance in the human body.
- <span style="color: aqua">Protects the teeth from wear</span> during biting and chewing.

##### Cementum
- A thin layer that <span style="color: lightgreen">replaces the enamel at the root of the teeth</span>.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Fixes the teeth into the jawbone</span> through the periodontal membrane.
- <span style="color: aqua">Allows the teeth to move slightly and acts as a shock-absorber.</span>

##### Dentine
- A <span style="color: lightgreen">bone-like, living layer</span> slightly harder than the cementum, but not as hard as the enamel.
- Contains numerous <span style="color: aqua">small canals with extensions of the cells in the pulp cavity</span>.

##### Pulp cavity
The structure contains:
- **Living cells** that <span style="color: lightgreen">produce dentine</span>.
- **Blood vessels** to <span style="color: lightgreen">supply oxygen and nutrients</span> to the living tissues and remove waste products (e.g. carbon dioxide).
- **Nerve endings** for <span style="color: lightgreen">sensing</span> (hot and cold) to achieve protection.

#### Types
##### Incisor
- **Location**: At the front of the jaw
- **Features**:
	- Chisel-shaped
	- With flat sharp edges
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">With one root</span>
- **Functions**: Biting and cutting food

##### Canine
- **Location**: Next to the incisors
- **Features**:
	- Pointed
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">With one root</span>
- **Functions**: Tearing food (especially flesh)

##### Premolar
- **Location**: At the sides of each jaw, behind the canine
- **Features**:
	- Broad top with <span style="color: lightgreen">two cusps</span>
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">With one or two roots</span>
- **Functions**: Crushing and grinding food

##### Molar
- **Location**: At the back of each jaw, behind the premolars
- **Features**:
	- Larger than premolars
	- Broad top with <span style="color: lightgreen">four cusps</span>
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">With two or three roots</span>
- **Functions**: Crushing and grinding food

#### Dentition and dental formula
**Dentition** describes the number and arrangement of different types of teeth in a mammal. It can be expressed as a **dental formula** showing the types and numbers of teeth on one side of the upper and lower jaws.

![[dentition1.avif|360]]

Below is an example of a dental formula of a human adult:
$\text{i}{2\over1}, \text{c}{1\over1}, \text{pm}{2\over2}, \text{m}{3\over3}$  (or $2123\over2123$)

The total number of teeth is calculated by multiplying the sum of the denominator and numerator by 2. â†’ *(denominator + numerator) x 2 = total number of teeth*

##### Milk teeth and permanent teeth
- **Milk teeth**: Appear between the ages of 6 months and 2.5 years.
  Gradually fall out and are replaced by permanent teeth between ages 6 and 12.

- **Permanent teeth**: Function for most of our lifetime.
  Cannot be replaced by new teeth if damaged or lost.

|                     | Incisors | Canines | Premolars | Molars | Total number |
| :-----------------: | :------: | :-----: | :-------: | :----: | :----------: |
|   **Milk teeth**    |    8     |    4    |   **0**   |   8    |      20      |
| **Permanent teeth** |    8     |    4    |     8     |   12   |      32      |
- There are <span style="color: lightgreen">no premolars</span> in milk teeth, and <span style="color: lightgreen">less molars</span>.

##### Wisdom teeth
Wisdom teeth are the <span style="color: lightgreen">third molars and the last teeth to erupt</span>, between the ages 16 and 25. Humans have four wisdom teeth (two on each side of the upper and lower jaws). <u>They may not erupt properly and become impacted, so they are commonly surgically removed.</u>
