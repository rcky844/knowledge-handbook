#### Routes absorbed food substances reach body tissue
![[assimilation_route.avif|450]]
After entering the bloodstream in the small intestine, monosaccharides, amino acids and other water-soluble food substances are transported to the liver by blood through the hepatic portal vein.

The liver may store or process food molecules, it returns to the bloodstream through the hepatic vein when released from the liver. Lipids absorbed from the small intestine are transported by the lymph in the [[Lymphatic system]] and empties into blood vessels near the heart.

All absorbed food molecules finally enter the bloodstream and are transported to different parts of the body for [[Respiration]] to release energy or storage.

#### Functions of the liver

1. **Regulation of blood glucose level**
   Liver removes excess glucose from the blood and converts it into glycogen. Glycogen can be converted back to glucose when blood glucose level falls below a normal range.

2. **Deamination of excess amino acids**
   *Main article: [[Deamination]]*

3. **Production of bile**
   Produces bile from breaking down red blood cells to help speed up the digestion of lipids.

4. **Storage of glycogen, iron and fat-soluble vitamins**
	- Store excess carbohydrates as glycogen as 'short-term' energy reserve.
	- Store iron from broken down old red blood cells and can be used to make new red blood cells.
	- Store fat-soluble vitamins (e.g. vitamins A and D) and carotene (can be converted to vitamin A).

5. **Detoxification**
   Converts certain toxic substances (e.g. hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, drugs) in the blood into harmless substances. Wastes formed are excreted in urine or bile.
