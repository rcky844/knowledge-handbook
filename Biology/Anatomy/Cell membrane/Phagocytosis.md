|   Process of phagocytosis and [[exocytosis]]   |

**Phagocytosis** is a process in cells to take in large solid particles or other cells that requires energy from respiration.

During the process, the cell membrane folds in to form a pit and extends out to form extensions called pseudopodia to enclose the particles in a vacuole. It is possible due to the flexible, fluid nature of the cell membrane.

#### Importance
- Helps with body defence against diseases in white blood cells (phagocytes).
  See "[[Phagocytosis (body defence)]]"

- As a means of feeding used by some unicellular organisms (e.g. *Amoeba*).
