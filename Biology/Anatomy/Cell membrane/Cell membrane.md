When in water or aqueous solution, the **cell membrane** is a [[Lipids#Phospholipids|phospholipid]] bilayer surrounding all cells. The bilayer consists mainly of phospholipid molecules and interspersed protein molecules. It is also differentially permeable, allowing control of the movement of substance into and out of the cell.

The fluid mosaic model is a scientific model proposed by S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson to explain the structure of the cell membrane.
- The bilayer is fluid in nature, phospholipid molecules and some protein molecules can move laterally.
- Proteins are interspersed within the bilayer and distributed in a mosaic pattern / asymmetric manner.

1. [[Phospholipid (Cell membrane)|Phospholipid]]\
2. [[Membrane proteins]]

#### Properties & functions

1. **Flexible and strong**
	- The fluid nature of the cell membrane allows it to break and fuse. This allows cells to change shape during cell growth, [[cell division]] and [[Phagocytosis]].
		- Phospholipid molecules are not chemically bonded, but only held by weak [[intermolecular forces]], which allows it to move slightly. (Fluid in nature)

	- The cell membrane is thin but strong enough to hold the cell contents. This is because:
		- [[Intermolecular forces]] between large numbers of molecules are collectively strong.
		- Protein molecules among the phospholipid bilayer provide strength.
		- Cholesterol plays pivotal roles in maintaining the structural integrity and regulating the fluidity of cell membranes.

2. **Differentially permeable**
   ![[cell_membrane_permeability.webp|500]]
	- Cell membrane is permeable to small, non-polar molecules (e.g. oxygen, carbon dioxide) and lipid-soluble substances (e.g. alcohol, lipid soluble vitamins and lipid hormones), as they can dissolve in the bilayer.
	- Cell membrane is impermeable to ions and polar molecules (e.g. water, water-soluble substances), as they are repelled by the bilayer. Instead, they move across the cell membrane through [[Membrane proteins|channel proteins or carrier proteins]].
