**Membrane proteins** occur on the surfaces of the bilayer. Some extend into or span completely through the bilayer.

##### Channel proteins
- Span the entire phospholipid bilayer.
- Form pores through which water, ions and water-soluble molecules may pass through.
- Each type of channel protein has a specific internal diameter and distribution of charges, allowing only particular types of ions or molecules to pass through. This give rise to the [[Cell membrane#Properties & functions|differentially permeable]] property of cell membranes.

##### Carrier proteins
- Span the entire phospholipid bilayer.
- Involved in active transport and facilitated diffusion.
- Each type of carrier protein has a specific shape, only complementary molecules may pass through. This give rise to the [[Cell membrane#Properties & functions|differentially permeable]] property of cell membranes.

##### [[Enzymes]]
- Located either on the outer or inner surface of the membrane.
- Helps to speed up chemical reactions (e.g. in small intestine, mitochondria).

##### Receptor proteins
- Located on the outer surface of the cell membrane.
- Binds with chemicals (e.g. [[hormones]]) that triggers or inhibit cellular activities.

##### Glycoproteins
- Attached to the surface.
- Act as recognition markers for white blood cells to recognise (especially on bacterial cells and other pathogens), allowing it to trigger immune responses to destroy invading pathogens or "foreign" bodies.
- The variations in number and pattern gives each cell type a unique identity label.

### Examples of functions
- **Glycoproteins**: Serve as [[antigens]] for cell recognition / recognition of pathogens
- **Enzymes**: For cellular [[metabolism]]
- **Carrier proteins**: Act as carriers which transport some substances across the membrane
	- Absorption of glucose in the [[small intestine]]
- **Receptor proteins**: Transmission of nerve impulses across a [[synapse]]
