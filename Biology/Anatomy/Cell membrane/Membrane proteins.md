**Membrane proteins** occur on the surfaces of the bilayer. Some extend into or span completely through the bilayer.

##### Channel proteins
- Span the <u>entire</u> phospholipid bilayer.
- Form pores through which <u>water, ions and water-soluble molecules</u> may pass through.
- Each type of channel protein has a specific internal diameter and distribution of charges, allowing only particular types of ions or molecules to pass through. This give rise to the [[Cell membrane#Properties & functions|differentially permeable]] property of cell membranes.

##### Carrier proteins
- Span the <u>entire</u> phospholipid bilayer.
- Involved in [[active transport]] and facilitated [[diffusion]].
- Each type of carrier protein has a specific shape, only complementary molecules may pass through. This give rise to the [[Cell membrane#Properties & functions|differentially permeable]] property of cell membranes.

##### [[Enzymes]]
- Located either on the <u>outer or inner surface</u> of the membrane.
- Helps to <u>speed up chemical reactions</u> (e.g. in small intestine, mitochondria).

##### Receptor proteins
- Located on the <u>outer surface</u> of the cell membrane.
- Binds with chemicals (e.g. [[hormones]]) that <u>triggers or inhibit cellular activities</u>.

##### Glycoproteins
- Attached to the <u>surface</u>.
- Act as <span style="color: violet">recognition markers</span> for [[Lymphocytes|white blood cells]] to recognise (especially on bacterial cells and other pathogens), allowing it to <u>trigger immune responses to destroy invading pathogens or "foreign" bodies</u>.
- The variations in number and pattern gives each cell type a <u>unique identity label</u>.

### Examples of functions
- **Glycoproteins**: Serve as [[antigens]] for cell recognition / recognition of pathogens
- **Enzymes**: For cellular [[metabolism]]
- **Carrier proteins**: Act as carriers which transport some substances across the membrane
	- Absorption of glucose in the [[small intestine]]
- **Receptor proteins**: Transmission of nerve impulses across a [[synapse]]
