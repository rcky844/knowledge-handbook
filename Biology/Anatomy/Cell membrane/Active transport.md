**Active transport** is an active process of transporting substances across the cell membrane against the conc. gradient with the use of energy from [[respiration]]. It involves specific [[Membrane proteins#Carrier proteins|carrier proteins]] on the cell membrane and occurs only in living cells.

Factors influencing the rate of respiration (e.g. temperature, oxygen concentration) affect the rate of active transport.

#### Importance
- Facilitates the active uptake of minerals from the soil into the roots of plants.
- Involved in the reabsorption of useful substances (e.g. glucose, amino acids) in the kidney tubules in humans.
- Speeds up the absorption of small water-soluble molecules (e.g. monosaccharides, amino acids, minerals, certain vitamins) into blood in the [[small intestine]].
