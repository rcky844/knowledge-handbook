In **diffusion**, molecules will move down a conc. gradient from a region of higher conc. to a region of lower conc. until they are evenly distributed (achieved [[equilibrium]]). The process takes place passively and depends on kinetic energy. The rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the concentration gradient.

Diffusion is used mostly for the movement of gases in biology (e.g. [[gas exchange]] in [[lungs]]).
It doesn't require energy from respiration, nor does it require a membrane.

#### Across a membrane
- Small and non-polar molecules (e.g. oxygen, carbon dioxide) diffuse directly through the bilayer down a conc. gradient without using ATP from respiration in the cell.
- Polar molecules (e.g. [[amino acids]], [[Carbohydrates#Monosaccharides|glucose]]) diffuse through [[Membrane proteins|channel proteins or carrier proteins]] without using energy from respiration in the cell in a process called facilitated diffusion.

#### Importance to organisms
- Useful substances (e.g. oxygen, nutrients in extracellular fluid) can diffuse into the cells.
- Metabolic wastes (e.g. carbon dioxide) can diffuse out of the cells.
This helps distribute substances within the cytoplasm.

#### Factors that increase the rate of diffusion
1. Steeper concentration gradient
2. Shorter distance
	- Diffusion is only effective over very short distances, because the further the distance between the two concentrations, the rate of diffusion decreases.
3. Higher surface area
4. Higher temperature
	- Particles possess higher kinetic energy at higher temperatures.
5. Small and soluble particles
	- Non-polar, lipid-soluble molecules diffuses through cell membranes more rapidly than polar, water-soluble particles.
	- Non-polar molecules can diffuse directly through the bilayer down a conc. gradient. However, polar molecules are prevented from directly diffusing through the bilayer, it has to diffuse through polar channel proteins or carrier proteins.
