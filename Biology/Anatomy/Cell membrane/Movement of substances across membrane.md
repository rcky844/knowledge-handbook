1. [[Diffusion]]
   Net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration (i.e. down a concentration gradient). No membrane needed.

2. [[Osmosis]]
   Net movement of water molecules across a <u>differentially permeable membrane</u> from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential.

3. [[Active transport]]
   Movement of substances across the cell membrane from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration (i.e. against a concentration gradient), requires [[ATP]] from [[respiration]] (i.e. requires living membrane).

4. [[Phagocytosis]]
   Uptake of large particles into the cells by the formation of a pit or pseudopodia at the cell membrane, requires [[ATP]] from respiration (i.e. requires living membrane).
