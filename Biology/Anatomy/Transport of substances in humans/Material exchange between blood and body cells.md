**Tissue fluid** is a watery fluid that fills the very small spaces in between body cells. It provides a relatively stable environment for the cells and serves as the medium across which exchange of materials between the blood and body cells takes place.

#### Formation of tissue fluid
Tissue fluid is formed from blood in a capillary bed.

##### Process
At the arterial end of the capillary bed, the hydrostatic pressure of the blood is higher than the tissue fluid. Some components of the plasma (e.g. water, minerals, glucose, amino acids, lipids and hormones) are forced out through the differentially permeable capillary walls to become tissue fluid.

##### Details
Tissue fluid does not contain plasma proteins, red blood cells and blood platelets as they are too large to pass through the walls of capillaries.

Some types of white blood cells (e.g. [[Phagocytosis (body defence)|phagocytes]]) can squeeze through the capillary walls and enter the tissue fluid to fight against invading pathogens. The tissue fluid also plays a role in [[Lymphocytes#B cells|humoral immunity]].

#### Exchange of materials in capillary beds
Exchange of materials between the tissue fluid and body cells takes place by diffusion and only at capillaries.

Body cells constantly take up oxygen and nutrients from the surrounding tissue fluid for respiration and metabolism, while producing carbon dioxide and other metabolic wastes.

#### Returning of tissue fluid to the blood
At the venous end of the capillary bed, excessive loss of water and the presence of plasma proteins cause the blood to have low hydrostatic pressure and lower water potential than that of tissue fluid. Water is drawn into the capillaries by osmosis.

About 90% of the tissue fluid returns to the blood at the venous end. The remaining 10% drains into lymph capillaries, which are part of the lymphatic system.
