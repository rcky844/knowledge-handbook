#### Arteries
![[arteries.webp|600]]

##### Structural features
- **Direction of blood flow**: Away from the heart (from the heart to body tissues)
- **Blood pressure**: High, due to the pumping action of the heart
- **Oxygenation of blood**: Oxygenated (except the pulmonary artery and the umbilical artery of an unborn baby)
- **Location**: Most arteries are located deep in the body
- **Wall**: Thicker muscular wall with more elastic fibres
- **Lumen**: Relatively small
- **Valves**: Absent (except at the base of the pulmonary artery and the aorta)
- **Rate of blood flow**: Faster

##### Structural adaptations
- **Arteries have very thick walls.**
  This is to withstand the high pressure of the blood.

- **The walls of the arteries contain large number of elastic fibres.**
  The walls can stretch when the heart contracts to pump blood into arteries and recoil when the heart relaxes. This helps maintain blood pressure and ensure a continuous blood flow.

- **The walls of arteries have a thick muscle layer.**
  The muscles contract and relax to change the diameter of the vessels in order to regulate the blood flow to certain organs or tissues.

#### Veins
![[veins.webp|600]]

##### Structural features
- **Direction of blood flow**: Towards the heart
- **Blood pressure**: Low, as blood has overcome resistance from the walls of blood vessels after travelling through many vessels over a long distance.

**Force to move the blood**:
- Contraction of skeletal muscles adjacent to the veins aids blood flow. When these skeletal muscles contract, the veins are squeezed and the blood inside is forced towards the heart.
- Inhalation creates negative pressure in the thoracic cavity that facilitates the flow of blood in veins back to the heart.

- **Oxygenation of blood**: Deoxygenated (except the pulmonary vein and the umbilical vein of an unborn baby)
- **Location**: Most veins are located closer to the body surface (for heat dissipation)
- **Wall**: Thinner wall with fewer elastic fibres
- **Lumen**: Relatively large
- **Valves**: Present
- **Rate of blood flow**: Slower

##### Structural adaptations
- **Veins have a larger lumen than arteries.**
  This reduces resistance so that blood can continue to flow in the veins at low pressure.

- **Valves are present.**
  This prevents the backflow of blood, which help ensure that blood flows in one direction only (towards the heart).

#### Capillaries
![[capillaries.webp|600]]

##### Structural features
- **Direction of blood flow**: Connect arteries and veins
- **Blood pressure**: Falls when the blood travels from the arterial end to the venous end
- **Oxygenation of blood**: Oxygenated at the arterial end, deoxygenated at the venous end
- **Location**: In body tissues (for exchange of materials between the blood and body cells, form networks called capillary beds)
- **Wall**: One-cell thick
- **Lumen**: Very small
- **Valves**: Absent
- **Rate of blood flow**: Very slow

##### Structural adaptations
- **The capillaries are highly branched.**
  This reduces resistance so that blood can continue to flow in the veins at low pressure.

- **The capillaries are very close to tissue cells.**
  This prevents the backflow of blood, ensuring that blood flows in one direction only (towards the heart).

- **The capillary network has a very large cross-sectional area.**
  Blood flows slowly, which allows more time for the exchange of materials.

- **The capillary wall is one-cell thick.**
  This provides a short diffusion distance for the exchange of materials.

- **The lumen size of capillaries is very small.**
  This brings red blood cells in close contact with the capillary wall, which reduces the distance for oxygen to diffuse from red blood cells to the body tissues.

- **The capillary wall is differentially permeable.**
  This allows small and soluble substances to be exchange, while retaining large molecules (e.g. plasma protein) in the blood.
