![[heart.webp|500]]

The **heart** is an organ that pumps blood around the body continuously to ensure a continuous blood flow. It is mainly made up of cardiac muscles, which contract and relax rhythmically without fatigue throughout life.

The **heart** lies in the thoracic cavity between the lungs and is protected by the rib cage. It is surrounded by a tough protective sac called the pericadium.

#### Atria
Both **atria** receive blood from the veins. They have thinner walls than the ventricles as they only need to pump blood into the ventricle through a small distance.
- The **left atrium** receives deoxygenated blood from all parts of the body (except the lungs) through the <u>superior vena cava</u> and <u>inferior vena cava</u>.
- The **right atrium** receives oxygenated blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins.

#### Ventricles
Both **ventricles** receive blood from the atria. They have thicker and more muscular wall than the atria, as they need to create greater muscular contractions to produce high blood pressure for transporting blood through a long distance.
- The **left ventricle** receives oxygenated blood from the left atrium and pumps the blood to all parts of the body (except the lungs) through the aorta.
- The **right ventricle** receives deoxygenated blood from the right atrium and pumps the blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries.

> [!note]
> The left ventricle has a thicker and more muscular wall than the right ventricle, as the left ventricle has to transport blood to all parts of the body (except the lungs).

#### (Atrial / ventricular) septum
The **septum** is a muscular wall that separates the right and left sides of the heart. It prevents the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.

#### Heart valves
Heart valves are present to prevent the backflow of blood and ensure blood flows through the heart in one direction only.

##### Bicuspid valve and tricuspid valve

- **Bicuspid valve**: Has two flaps, separates the left atrium and left ventricle.
- **Tricuspid valve**: Has three flaps, separates the right atrium and right ventricle.

They separate the atrium from the ventricle, and are closed by the high pressure of blood in each ventricle when the ventricles contract to prevent the backflow of blood into the atria.

##### Semilunar valves
![[semilunar_valves.webp|120]]

Semilunar valves are pocket-shaped structures found at the base of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. They close to prevent the backflow of blood into the ventricles.

#### Cardiac muscles
**Cardiac muscles** are muscles that makes up the heart. They are located in the walls of the heart to give a driving force for maintaining blood flow. Their cells contain many mitochondria which provide a lot of ATP for continuous contraction. Therefore, it is highly resistant to fatigue.

They receive oxygen and nutrients from the coronary arteries, which branch off the aorta. Carbon dioxide and other metabolic wastes are carried away through the coronary veins.
