Blood is a lipid tissue consisting of blood cells suspended in plasma. A human adult has about five litres of blood.

When blood is spun at high speed in a centrifuge, the blood cells go to the bottom part of the tube, and a pale yellow layer on top is plasma.

#### Composition of blood
##### Plasma
Plasma is the liquid part of blood. It is made up of mostly water (90%) with a variety of substances dissolved in it.

- **Plasma proteins ([[Blood clotting|fibrinogen]], [[antibodies]])**
  For blood clotting and body defence.

- **Inorganic ions**
  For regulating blood pH and osmosis.

- **Nutrients (e.g. [[Human nutrition|glucose, amino acids, lipids, vitamins]])**
  As energy sources or for the synthesis of other biomolcules.

- **Respiratory gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide)**
  Oxygen is used in respiration to release energy, while carbon dioxide is a waste product of respiration.

- **Urea**
  A waste product of protein metabolism.

- **Hormones**
  Serve as chemical messengers that regulate metabolic processes in the body.

##### Blood cells
1. [[Red blood cells]]
2. [[White blood cells]]
3. [[Blood platelets]]

#### Functions of blood
1. **Transport of substances**
	- **Oxygen (lungs → body cells)**
	  Most are carried by haemoglobin in red blood cells and some are dissolved in plasma to be used in respiration.
	- **Carbon dioxide (body cells → lungs)**
	  Most are transported in plasma as hydrogencarbonate ions for removal.
	- **Nutrients**
	  Transported in plasma from the small intestine to the liver, and then to other parts of the body.
	- **Urea (liver → kidneys)**
	  Waste product formed from the breakdown of excess amino acids in the liver, transported to the kidneys to be excreted in urine.
	- **Hormones**
	  Secreted by endocrine glands into the bloodstream and transported in plasma to their target organs to regulate metabolic processes.
	- **Antibodies**
	  Produced by lymphocytes and are transported in plasma for body defence.

2. **Body defence**
	- [[Blood clotting]]: Blood platelets play a role in blood clotting; the formation of blood clots at wounds prevents entry of pathogens and further loss of blood.
	- [[Phagocytosis (body defence)|Phagocytosis]]: Phagocytes engulf and digest invading pathogens.
	- Production of [[antibodies]]: Lymphocytes produce antibodies which destroy pathogens or neutralize the toxins produced by pathogens.

3. **Distribution of heat**
	- Absorbs hear from metabolically active organs (e.g. live and muscles), and distributes it throughout the body.
	- This helps maintain a constant body temperature.
