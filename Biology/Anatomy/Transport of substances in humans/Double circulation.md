In a **double circulation** system, blood flows through the heart twice. This is the most efficient way of circulation found in all mammals.

This system of circulation consists of two parts â€” **pulmonary circulation** and **systemic circulation**. The pulmonary circulation connects the heart and the lungs, while the systemic circulation connects the heart and all parts of the body (except the lungs).

#### Advantages
- The pulmonary circulation is separated from the systemic circulation.
  Only oxygenated blood is carried to the body tissues.

- Blood pressures in pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation are different. 
	- Strong contractions of the left ventricle <u>create high blood pressure</u> to <u>move blood quickly</u> through the systemic circulation to all parts of the body.
	- Weaker contraction of the right ventricle <u>protects the delicate capillaries in the lungs from damage by high pressure</u>.
  This ensures a higher hydrostatic blood pressure in the systemic circulation compared to a single circulatory system.
