#### Structures
##### Lymph
The **lymph** is formed when tissue fluid is inside the lymph capillaries. It has almost the same composition as the tissue fluid and blood.

However, unlike blood, it has:
- No red blood cells, blood platelets or plasma proteins (as they cannot enter the tissue fluid)
- Less oxygen and nutrients (as they have been absorbed by the body cells)
- More carbon dioxide and wastes that have been released from the body cells
- More lipids and fat-soluble vitamins that have been absorbed from the small intestine through [[Small intestine#Adaptations|lacteals]]

##### Lymph capillaries
![[lymph_capilaries.webp|400]]

**Lymph capillaries** are tiny, blind-ended vessels found in almost all tissues of the body. Their walls are one-cell thick.

Tissue fluid can pass through the spaces between their cells and enter into the lymph capillaries <u>by hydrostatic pressure</u>.

##### Lymph vessels
Lymph capillaries from different parts of the body join to form **lymph vessels**, which then join to form larger vessels. These lymph vessels join two large veins at the base of the neck, returning lymph to the blood.

###### Flow of lymph in lymph vessels
Flow of lymph is driven by the contraction of skeletal muscles adjacent to the lymph vessels. When the skeletal muscles contract, they press against the lymph vessels. pushing the lymph along.

Furthermore, there are valves in the lymph vessels (similar to those in veins). They prevent the backflow of lymph and ensure that the lymph flows only towards the heart.

##### Lymph nodes
![[lymph_nodes.webp]]

**Lymph nodes** are small swellings at intervals along the lymph vessels where [[White blood cells]] are stored. When lymph flows through lymph nodes, the pathogens contained within will be destroyed by the white blood cells.

Lymph is therefore effectively filtered by the lymph node before returning the the bloodstream. It helps in body defence.

#### Functions 
- It collects excess tissue fluid and returns the fluid to the blood.
- It transports lipids and fat-soluble vitamins from the lacteals of intestinal villi to the blood.
- It is important for body defence. (Lymph nodes remove pathogens from the lymph)
