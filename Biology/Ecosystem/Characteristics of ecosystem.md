#### Interactions between organisms and the environment
- [[Relationships between organisms|Between organisms (symbiosis)]]
- [[Abiotic factors|Between the environment]]

#### Energy flow
- Energy flows from one organism to another in the form of chemical energy in food.
- Energy cannot be recycled and is eventually lost from the ecosystem in the form of heat.
- A constant input of energy is needed. Most ecosystems obtain energy from sunlight through [[Photosynthesis]] by plants.

#### Material cycling
- Materials are cycled between the biotic and abiotic components.
- Elements that make up an organism will be returned to the environment when it dies. It will be taken up by organism in a cycle.

> **Note**:
> There is no cycling of energy in an ecosystem. Energy lost cannot be recycled by the ecosystem.
