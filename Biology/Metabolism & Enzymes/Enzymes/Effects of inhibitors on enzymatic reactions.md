**Inhibitors** (e.g. cyanide, heavy metals) decrease the rate of enzymatic reactions by binding to enzyme to change the shape or active sites, or blocking the entry of substrate into the active site.

#### Functioning of inhibitors
##### Competitive inhibitor
![[competitive_inhibitor_diagram.webp|300]]
- **Shape / Conformation**
  Similar to the substrate molecules, so they share the same active site.
- **Inhibitory action**
  Compete with substrates for the active sites on the enzyme molecules.
- **Conc. of substrates**
  When substrate concentration increases, the rate of enzymatic reaction increases to a level similar to before adding a competitive inhibitor.

##### Non-competitive inhibitor
![[non_competitive_inhibitor_diagram.webp|300]]
- **Shape / Conformation**
  Not similar to the substrate molecules.
- **Inhibitory action**
  Bind with enzyme in a way that it reduces the catalytic properties of the enzyme.
- **Conc. of substrate**
  The inhibitory activity cannot be overcame by increasing the substrate concentration.
