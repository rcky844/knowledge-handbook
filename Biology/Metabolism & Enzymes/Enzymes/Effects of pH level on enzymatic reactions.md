- Enzymes work within a narrow range of pH and work best at their optimum pH.
- Enzymes are <u>denatured</u> at pH values outside the optimum range.

<hr>

Enzymes are protein in nature, changes in pH affect the ionisation of the amino acids. This may cause a change in the conformation of the active site, in which enzymes will be denatured, thus affecting the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex.
