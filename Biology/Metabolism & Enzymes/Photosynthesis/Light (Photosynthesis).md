#### Experiment on its need in photosynthesis
![[photosynthesis_light_test.webp|360]]

- **Set-up**
  Covering a part of the leaf with black paper, so that this part does not receive light.

- **Exposed part (experimental setup)**
  Can carry out photosynthesis to produce starch, which is stained blue-black in iodine test.

- **Masked part (control setup)**
  Cannot carry out photosynthesis to produce starch, and is stained brown in iodine test.

#### Involved processes
- [[Photochemical reactions#Light absorption and electron transport]]
  Chlorophyll molecule in the thylakoid membrane absorbs light energy, causing electrons to be excited to higher energy levels.

- [[Photochemical reactions#Photolysis of water]]
  Some of the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

#### Rate of photosynthesis (light intensity)
##### Experiment
![[photosynthesis_light_rate_exp.webp|450]]

1. Cut a piece of *Hydrilla* plant (~10 cm long) under water. Place the plant, with the cut end upwards, in a boiling tube containing dilute sodium hydrogencarbonate solution.
2. Set up the apparatus. The beaker of water should remain at room temperature. Measure the temperature of the water at intervals throughout the investigation. Renew the water if its temperature becomes too high.
3. Place the lamp at 0.1 m from the *Hydrilla* plant and turn the lamp on. Wait for five minutes to allow the plant to equilibrate.
4. Suck up some solution from the boiling tube into the pipette. Tighten the clip and record the initial liquid level in the pipette.
5. After 10 minutes, record the liquid level in the pipette again.
6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 with the lamp placed at different distances (d) from the *Hydrilla* plant (e.g. 0.2 m, 0.3 m, 0.4 m, 0.5 m).
7. Calculate the rate of photosynthesis (volume of gas collected per unit time) in different light intensities (‚àù 1/d<sup>2</sup>).
8. Plot a graph of the rate of photosynthesis against light intensities (See the graph below).

This experimental procedure is also used in [[Carbon dioxide (Photosynthesis)#Experiment]].
Instead, the concentration of $\ce{NaHCO3}$ solution varies.

Note that:
- **Dependent variable**: Rate of photosynthesis *(volume of gas collected per unit time)*
- **Independent variable**: Light intensity *(distance of light from the Hydrilla plant)*
- **Control variables**: Temperature, $\ce{CO2}$ concentration *(concentration of $\ce{NaHCO3}$ solution)*

1. When there is no light, no photosynthesis takes place.

2. At low light intensities, the light intensity (a limiting factor) limits the rate of photosynthesis. As the light intensity increases, more energy is supplied to the [[Photochemical reactions]] and stomata open wider to allow carbon dioxide (a substrate for [[Carbon fixation]]) to diffuse into the leaves. Therefore, the rate of photosynthesis increases.

3. At a certain light intensity, photosynthesis reaches its maximum rate (saturation point).
   The light intensity at the saturation point is called optimum light intensity.

4. After the saturation point, further increases in light intensity have no effect on the rate of photosynthesis. Another factor (e.g. $\ce{CO2}$ concentration or temperature) now limits the rate of photosynthesis.

Note that:
- At low to moderate light intensities (before reaching the saturation point), the rate of photosynthesis increases with an increase in light intensity.
- When the light intensity has increased to the saturation point, the rate of photosynthesis levels off.
- At very high light intensities, chlorophyll molecules may be damaged, and thus reduce the rate of photosynthesis.
