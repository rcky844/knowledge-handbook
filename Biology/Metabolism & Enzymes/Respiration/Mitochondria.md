**Mitochondria** is a rod-shaped organelle <span style="color: lightgreen">surrounded by a double membrane</span>, where reactions of [[Aerobic respiration]] take place.

- <span style="color: skyblue">Outer membrane</span> is <span style="color: lightgreen">differentially permeable</span>.
  This allows it to <u>control the movement of molecules</u> into and out of the mitochondria.

- <span style="color: skyblue">Inner membrane</span> is <span style="color: lightgreen">highly folded</span>, and forms a large number of finger-like projections (<span style="color: skyblue">cristae</span>).
  This provides a <u>large surface area for the attachment of enzymes and carriers</u> involved in [[Aerobic respiration]].

- <span style="color: skyblue">Matrix</span> is the space <span style="color: lightgreen">enclosed by the inner membrane</span>.
  It is filled with a fluid and contains enzymes that catalyse the reactions of [[Aerobic respiration]].

- Outer and inner membranes are separated by a narrow <span style="color: skyblue">intermembrane space</span>.
  This allows molecules to <u>move quickly</u> between the cell cytoplasm and the mitochondrial matrix.

> **Note**:
> Mitochondria are the main sites for ATP production. The presence of this organelle depends on the cell's energy usage.
> <u>Large quantities of this organelle are present in cells that use a lot of energy (metabolically active cells)</u> (e.g. sperms, liver cells, muscle cells), as they need to synthesize more ATP to support cellular activities.
