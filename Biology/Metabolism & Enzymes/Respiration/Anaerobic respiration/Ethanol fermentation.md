Yeast can respire anaerobically when oxygen is insufficient. This process is called **alcoholic fermentation**.

![[ethanol_fermentation.avif|500]]

- After [[Glycolysis]], pyruvate loses a carbon dioxide molecule, and accepts hydrogen from NADH to form ethanol.
- NAD is regenerated and can be used in [[Glycolysis]] again.

$\ce{glucose ->[enzymes] energy (2ATP) + 2 ethanol + 2 carbon dioxide}$

> **Note**:
> Ethanol cannot be further metabolised, it is a waste product.

#### Examples and applications
##### In plants
Apart from yeasts, alcoholic fermentation also occurs in some bacteria and plants. Germinating seeds and root cells of plants can carry out alcoholic fermentation for a short time in oxygen-poor environments such as waterlogged soil.

##### Beer-making and wine-making
In beer-making, yeast is used to ferment the sugars in barley into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The ethanol makes the beer alcoholic and the carbon dioxide bubbles in the beer.

In wine-making, wild yeast naturally present on the skin of grapes ferments the sugars in grape juice under anaerobic conditions.

##### Bread-making
In bread-making, yeast is used to make the bread dough. The yeast carries out alcoholic fermentation, converting the sugars in the dough to ethanol and carbon dioxide.

The carbon dioxide causes the dough to rise. When the dough is baked in an oven, the carbon dioxide inside the dough expands and forms holes, making the bread spongy. The yeast is killed and the ethanol is evaporated by the heat of the oven.

##### Production of biofuels
Yeast is grown in anaerobic conditions to ferment sugars derived from crops (e.g. maize and sugar cane) to produce ethanol, which can be used as fuels for car engines.
