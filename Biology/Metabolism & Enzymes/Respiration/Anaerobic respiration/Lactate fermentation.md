Mammalian muscle cells can respire **anaerobically** when doing <span style="color: lightgreen">strenuous exercise</span> (high-intensity exercise of a short duration. e.g. sprinting and weight lifting), as <span style="color: aqua">oxygen may be used up more rapidly than it can be supplied to the muscles</span>. This process is called **lactate fermentation** or **lactic acid fermentation**.

![[lactate_fermentation.avif|500]]

- After [[glycolysis]], pyruvate accepts hydrogen from NADH to form lactic acid by reduction.
- NAD is regenerated and can be used in [[glycolysis]] again.

$\ce{glucose ->[enzymes] energy (2ATP) + 2 lactic acid}$

The additional energy can be provided to skeletal muscles quickly for powerful and rapid contractions.

Lactic acid formed in muscles is <u>transported to the liver in blood</u>. When oxygen is available, liver cells convert lactic acid back to pyruvate, which has one of the following fates:
- Pyruvate is broken down into carbon dioxide and water through [[Aerobic respiration|aerobic pathway]].
- Pyruvate is converted (oxidized) to glucose and then to glycogen in the liver for storage.

For a while after exercise, we <span style="color: lightgreen">continue to breathe deeply and rapidly</span>. The <span style="color: aqua">extra oxygen taken in during this period of time is to metabolize the lactic acid</span> formed in [[anaerobic respiration]], and is called <span style="color: skyblue">oxygen debt</span>.

#### Examples and applications
##### Production of diary products
During <u>yogurt and cheese production</u>, bacteria ferment lactose in milk and produce lactic acid in the absence of oxygen.
- Lactic acid helps <u>coagulate milk proteins</u>, and gives yogurt and cheese their <u>characteristics flavours</u>.

##### Making fermented vegetables
Lactic acid is formed when bacteria <u>ferment the carbohydrates in the cabbage</u>.
- The lactic acid helps <u>preserve</u> kimchi and gives kimchi its <u>sour flavour</u>.
