**Anaerobic respiration** takes place with there is little or no oxygen. However, some organisms or cell types can carry out anaerobic respiration and remain alive in low oxygen conditions.

**Anaerobic respiration** does not replace aerobic respiration, but both occur at the same time. 

> [!note]
> Without oxygen, the [[Link Reaction]], the [[Krebs cycle]] and [[Oxidative phosphorylation]] do not occur.

#### Anaerobic pathways
Some cells are able to oxidise the reduced NAD produced during [[Glycolysis]] so it can be used for further hydrogen transport. This means that <u>glycolysis can continue</u> and <u>small amounts of ATP are still produced</u>.

**Examples of anaerobic pathways**:
- Yeast and microorganisms use [[Ethanol fermentation]]
- Other microorganisms and mammalian muscle cells use [[Lactate fermentation]] (lactic acid)

#### Efficiency
Net ATP yield of anaerobic respiration is only 2 ATP from [[Glycolysis]], which is much less efficient than [[Aerobic respiration]]. However, the reactions are much simpler, the cells could obtain additional energy even under anaerobic conditions.
