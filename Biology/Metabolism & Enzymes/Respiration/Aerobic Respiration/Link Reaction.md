**Link Reaction** is the second stage of respiration. It links [[glycolysis]] and [[Krebs cycle]].

> [!note]
> The end product of [[Glycolysis]] is pyruvate, which still contains a substantial amount of chemical energy that can be further utilised in respiration to produce more ATP.

When <u>oxygen is available</u>, pyruvate will enter the <span style="color: skyblue">mitochondrial matrix</span> and <span style="color: skyblue">aerobic respiration</span> will continue.
- As pyruvate moves across the double membrane of the mitochondria via [[active transport]], it requires a transport protein and a small amount of ATP.

**Overall products** (per glucose molecule):
- 2 Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)
- 2 Carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$)
- 2 Reduced NAD ($\ce{NADH}$)

> [!note]
> - There are two pyruvate molecules produced per glucose molecule, everything needs to be multiplied by 2 when thinking about what happens to a single glucose molecule in aerobic respiration.

1. **Decarboxylation and dehydrogenation of pyruvate**
	- <u>Carbon atom is lost in the form of carbon dioxide.</u> It is removed as <u>metabolic waste</u> during gas exchange.
	- Hydrogen is removed and transferred to NAD to form NADH.
	- An acetyl group ($\ce{CH3C(O)-}$) is produced.

> [!note]
> - Decarboxylation and dehydrogenation involves reactions catalysed by enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix.
> - Coenzymes are not enzymes. They work with enzymes to catalyse reactions by transferring certain chemical groups.

2. **Combination with coenzyme A**
   The acetyl group combines with coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA. It acts as a carrier to transfer the acetyl group to the [[Krebs cycle]].
