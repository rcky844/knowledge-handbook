**Respiration** is the process by which the chemical energy stored in food is released. It is also called **cellular respiration** as it takes place within cells. **Glucose** is a common <span style="color: skyblue">substrate</span> used in respiration.

> [!note]
> Some cells (e.g. brain cells) use glucose as their respiratory substrates, while other cells can use fatty acids, glycerol and amino acids as well.

There are two types of respiration:
- [[Aerobic respiration]] - oxygen is required.
- [[Anaerobic respiration]] - oxygen is not required.

**Respiration** is an oxidative process. It occurs through a series of enzyme-controlled reactions, with some releasing energy or used to synthesize ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Most of the energy (60%) is lost as heat.

**Word equation for respiration**:
$\ce{glucose + oxygen ->[enzymes] carbon dioxide + water + energy (ATP and heat)}$

> **Respiration** is often compared with burning.
> - Burning is rapid and uncontrolled. The process is a one-step reaction and releases energy rapidly.
> - Respiration occurs in small steps and releases energy gradually.
