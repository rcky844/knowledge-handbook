**Plants** (scientifically *Plantae*) are <span class="hi-green">multicellular eukaryotes</span>. They belong in the domain *Eukarya*.

*Characteristics*:
- Have a rigid [[cell wall]] surrounding their cells.
- <span class="hi-green">Immovable and stationary</span>, but their body can move by growing and respond to stimulus ([[phototropic response]]).

> [!warning]
> Although the Telegraaf plant show movement at speeds visible to the naked eye, it is not a type of locomotion, as it is defined as the movement from one place to another.

*Nutrition*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Autotrophic</span>: Have chlorophyll for carrying out [[photosynthesis]], acts as producers.
- <span class="hi-blue">Heterotrophic</span>: Found in non-green plants (e.g. [[protists]]) that do not have chlorophyll for carrying out [[photosynthesis]], can be saprophytes or parasites.

Classification of plants ⤴️

> [!tip] Classification by flowering
> - <u>Only flowering plants produce flowers.</u>
> - Sometimes, plants are classified by whether they can produce flowers.

# Non-vascular plants
**Non-vascular plants** (e.g. <span class="hi-green">mosses</span>) are small plants with simple leaves and stems <u>lacking vascular tissues</u> to support its body against gravity.

*General characteristics*:
- <span class="hi-green">No true roots</span> - Have <span class="hi-blue">rhizoids</span> (root-like structures) to anchor them to substrates.
- Live in <span class="hi-green">damp, shady places</span>.
- Absorb water and minerals through the whole surface of the plant.
- Materials <u>move from cell to cell</u> within the plant by [[diffusion]] and [[osmosis]].
- Reproduce asexually by <span class="hi-blue">spores</span>.

# Vascular plants
**Vascular plants** have <span class="hi-blue">vascular tissues</span> for transport of materials and support.

*General characteristics*:
- Have <span class="hi-green">true roots, leaves and stems</span>.
- Larger and taller than non-vascular plants.
- Well adapted to dry habitats.

## Ferns
**Ferns** are <span class="hi-green">seedless</span> vascular plants.
- Most have large, <span class="hi-green">feathery leaves</span>, with <span class="hi-green">curled young leaves</span>.
- Reproduce asexually by <span class="hi-blue">spores</span>, usually found on the underside of the leaves.

## Conifers
**Conifers** (e.g. pines, firs, cypresses) are a group of tall trees.
- Most are <span class="hi-green">evergreen and have needle-shaped leaves</span>.
- <span class="hi-blue"><u>Gymnosperms</u></span> - have <span class="hi-blue">naked seeds</span> <u>enclosed in cones</u> for (sexual) reproduction, but <span class="hi-green">do not produce flowers</span>.
- Can reproduce asexually by spores.

## Flowering plants
**Flowering plants** are a diverse group of <u>vascular seed plants</u> that <span class="hi-green">produce flowers</span>. 
- <span class="hi-blue"><u>Angiosperms</u></span> - have <span class="hi-green">seeds enclosed in fruits formed from the ovary of flowers</span>.

|           Examples            | Grasses, sugar cane, orchids, lilies |  *Hibiscus*, roses, sunflowers, cacti   |

> [!note]
> Cotyledons are the first leaves that emerge during [[germination of seeds]].
