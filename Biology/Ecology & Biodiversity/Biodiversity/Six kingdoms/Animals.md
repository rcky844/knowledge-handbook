**Animals** (scientifically *Animalia*) are a diverse group of <span class="hi-green">multicellular eukaryotes</span>. They belong in the domain *Eukarya*. They can be classified by the living habitats and anatomical characteristics.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span class="hi-green">no cell walls</span>.
- Most can move from place to place
  (exceptions include primitive early organisms, like sponge)

*Nutrition*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Heterotrophic</span>: Depend on other organisms for food, acts as consumers.

Classification of animals ⤴️

# Invertebrates
**Invertebrates** are animals that <span class="hi-green">do not have a vertebral column</span>.

*General characteristics*:
- Generally <span class="hi-green">soft-bodied</span>, lacking a rigid internal skeleton for the attachment of muscles.
- Some have a <span class="hi-blue">hydroskeleton</span> (e.g. jellyfish, earthworms), an <span class="hi-green">enclosed, liquid-filled cavity</span> using <span class="hi-green">liquid pressure</span> to provide support.
- Some have an <span class="hi-blue">exoskeleton</span>. It is a <span class="hi-green">hard or tough outer shell</span>, providing a framework for support, protecting soft body tissues, and <span class="hi-green">preventing water loss</span>.

# Vertebrates
**Vertebrates** are animals that have a <span class="hi-blue">vertebral column</span>, which form part of their internal skeleton of <u>bones or cartilage</u>.

## Fish
**Fish** is a group of organisms living in water.

*Anatomical characteristics*:
- Have <span class="hi-blue">grills</span> for gas exchange.
- Have <span class="hi-blue">fins</span> for swimming and balancing in water.
- Have <span class="hi-blue">streamlined body</span> that reduces resistance while swimming.
- Have <span class="hi-blue">lateral lines</span> along each side of a fish's body, with <span class="hi-green">sense organ</span> that detects changes in surrounding water pressure caused by predators or prey.
- <span class="hi-blue">Ectotherms</span> - Mainly <span class="hi-green">gain heat from the environment</span>, body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings. ([[Water#As a temperature buffer]])
- Most have a <span class="hi-blue">swim bladder</span>, a sac-like organ <span class="hi-green">containing gas</span> that allow them to go up an down by the changes in gas pressure.
- Most are covered with <span class="hi-green">wet, slimy</span> <span class="hi-blue">scales</span>.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span class="hi-blue">external fertilization</span> (eggs fertilized outside the body).
- Gametes are released into the surrounding water, where fertilization takes place.

**Examples**: goldfish, eels, sharks, seahorses

## Amphibians
**Amphibians** are organisms that live part of their live in water and part of their life on land.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span class="hi-green">smooth / naked</span> <span class="hi-blue">skin</span>.
- Tadpoles use <span class="hi-blue">grills</span> for gas exchange, adult amphibians use <span class="hi-blue">lungs and skin surface</span> for gas exchange.
- Most adults amphibians have four limbs.
- <span class="hi-blue">Ectotherms</span> - Mainly <span class="hi-green">gain heat from the environment</span>, body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span class="hi-blue">external fertilization</span> (eggs fertilized outside the body).
- Gametes are released into the surrounding water, where fertilization takes place.

*Life cycle*:
- Fertilized eggs of amphibians hatch into <span class="hi-blue">larvae</span> (or <span class="hi-blue">tadpoles</span>), living in water.
- They undergo <span class="hi-blue">metamorphosis</span> to change into adult form, which can live on land.

*Examples*: frog, toad, salamander

## Reptiles
**Reptiles** are fully adapted to life on land.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span class="hi-blue">lungs</span> for gas exchange.
- Covered with <span class="hi-green">dry, hard</span> <span class="hi-blue">scales</span>, which <u>offer protection and prevent water loss</u>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Ectotherms</span> - Mainly <span class="hi-green">gain heat from the environment</span>, body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span class="hi-blue">internal fertilization</span> (eggs are fertilized inside the female's body).
- Most lay eggs with a leathery or hard shell, preventing the eggs from desiccation on land and protects the embryo inside.

*Examples*: lizards, snakes, crocodiles, turtles

## Birds
**Birds** are terrestrial and well-adapted for flight.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span class="hi-blue">lungs</span> for gas exchange.
- Have <span class="hi-blue">feathers</span> covering their bodies and have dry scales on their legs.
- Have <span class="hi-blue">fore limbs</span> modified into <span class="hi-blue">wings</span>.
- Have <span class="hi-blue">light-weight bones</span> <span class="hi-green">containing cavities</span>, and a <span class="hi-blue">beak</span> with <u>no teeth</u>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Endotherms</span> - <span class="hi-green">generate body heat internally by metabolism</span> to <span class="hi-green">maintain a stable body temperature</span>.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span class="hi-blue">internal fertilization</span> (eggs are fertilized inside the female's body).
- Lay eggs with a leathery or hard shell.

*Examples*: eagles, hummingbirds, ostriches, penguins

## Mammals
**Mammals** can be terrestrial or aquatic.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span class="hi-blue">lungs</span> for breathing.
- Have <span class="hi-blue">hair</span> <u>covering their bodies</u>.
- Many have <span class="hi-green">sweat glands</span> in their skin, producing sweat to help cool the body.
- Have limbs specialized for their way of locomotion.
- <span class="hi-blue">Endotherms</span> - <span class="hi-green">generate body heat internally</span> by [[metabolism]] to <span class="hi-green">maintain a stable body temperature</span>.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span class="hi-blue">internal fertilization</span> (eggs are fertilized inside the female's body).
- <span class="hi-green">Female carry the embryo</span> (later fetus) during the gestation period, and have <span class="hi-blue">placentas</span> for material exchange.
- Females have <span class="hi-blue">mammary glands</span>, which [[Birth process and parental care#Breast-feeding and its benefits|produce milk]] after the birth of offspring.

*Examples*: humans, rabbits, dogs, pigs, bats, whales, dolphins
