**Fungi** are <span style="color: lightgreen">unicellular or multicellular eukaryotes</span>. They belong in the domain *Eukarya*.

*Examples of fungi*:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Unicellular</span>: Yeasts
- <span style="color: skyblue">Multicellular</span>: Mushroom, bread mould

*Characteristics*:
- Found in <span style="color: lightgreen">wet areas</span>, and live in mesh of thread-like filaments collectively called a <span style="color: skyblue">mycelium</span>. Each filament is called a <span style="color: skyblue">hypha</span>.
- Have a cell wall made of <span style="color: skyblue">chitin</span> (nitrogen containing polysaccharide).
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Immovable and stationary</span> (but yeasts may show limited movement).
- Can be <span style="color: skyblue">parasites</span> that cause [[Types of pathogens#Fungi|diseases]] (in animals and plants).
- Some have <span style="color: lightgreen">antibacterial properties</span>, so they are used for the production of [[antibiotics]] (e.g. Penicillium moulds).

*Nutrition*:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Heterotrophic nutrition</span> only, as they do not have chlorophyll.
- Most are <span style="color: skyblue">saprophytes</span>, feeding on dead organisms or non-living organic matter.
- Their <span style="color: lightgreen">hyphae secrete enzymes</span> onto the food to carry out <span style="color: violet">external digestion</span>.
- Saprophytic fungi play a major role in the [[Source of energy#Classification of organisms|recycling of materials in an ecosystem]] as a decomposer.

*Reproduction*: [[Asexual reproduction|Asexually]]
- **Budding in yeast and *Hydra***
  The parent develops an outgrowth (bud), which grows larger and eventually breaks off as an offspring that is smaller than the parent, but is genetically identical to the parent.

- **Spore formation in fungi** (e.g. Bread mould)
  Reproduces by forming spores which can be carried over long distances by wind and will develop into a new fungus under suitable conditions.
