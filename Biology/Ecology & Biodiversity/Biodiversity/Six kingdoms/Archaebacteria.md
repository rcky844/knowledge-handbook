**Archaebacteria** are <span class="hi-green">unicellular prokaryotes</span>, with body size smaller than [[eubacteria]]. They are only observable with high magnification under a light microscope. They belong in the domain *Archaea*.

*Characteristics*:
- Live in <span class="hi-green">extreme environments</spanN> (e.g. hot springs, highly salty water, oxygen-free environments - marshes, digestive tracts)
- Most <span class="hi-green">have a cell wall</span>, with a <u>composition lacking peptidoglycan</u> and different from that of [[eubacteria]]. The composition of their [[cell membrane]] is unique compared to other organisms.
- Can be <span class="hi-green">beneficial or harmful</span> to animals.

*Locomotion*:
- Some have <span class="hi-blue">flagella</span> or cilia for movement.
- Some secrete a slime layer and ooze over surfaces like slugs.

*Nutrition & energy*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Autotrophic</span>: By [[photosynthesis]], acts as a producer.
- <span class="hi-blue">Heterotrophs</span>: Breaks down and absorb material in dead or decaying organisms, acts as decomposer.

*Reproduction*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Asexual</span>, by [[Asexual reproduction#Binary fission in bacteria|binary fission]]
- They can reproduce in a short amount of time.
