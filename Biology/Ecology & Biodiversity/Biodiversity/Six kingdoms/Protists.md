**Protists** (scientifically *Protista*) is a diverse kingdom made up of <span class="hi-green">unicellular or multicellular eukaryotes</span>. They belong in the domain *Eukarya*. They are classified based on their way of obtaining energy.

*Types of protists and nutrition*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Algae</span> <span class="hi-green">(<u>plant-like protists</u>)</span> (e.g. *Spirogyra*, kelps)
	- <span class="hi-blue">Autotrophic</span>: By [[Photosynthesis]], acts as a producer.

- <span class="hi-blue">Protozoans</span> <span class="hi-green">(<u>animal-like protists</u>)</span> (e.g. *Amoeba*, *Paramecium*)
	- <span class="hi-blue">Heterotrophs</span>: By eating other organisms, acts as a consumer.
	- <span class="hi-green">Movable</span> (so they can hunt organisms)

- <span class="hi-blue">Fungus-like protists</span> (e.g. slime moulds)
	- <span class="hi-blue">Heterotrophs</span>: Absorb nutrients from dead organisms or non-living organic matter, acts as a decomposer.

*Characteristics*:
- Live mainly in water or moist environments
- Have a <span class="hi-green">true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles</span>.
- Some are [[Types of pathogens#Protists|parasites]] living inside other organisms. 

*Locomotion*:
- Pseudopod (false foot)
- Flagella / cilia (hairs)
- Contractile vacuoles

*Reproduction*:
- Most <span class="hi-blue">asexually</span>, can be by spore formation in fungus-like protists.
- Some reproduce <span class="hi-blue">sexually</span>.
