# Human impact on ecosystems
## Overexploitation of wildlife
Wildlife is being overexploited by humans in the field of:
- **Food and culinary** — Overfishing of bluefin tuna
- **Medicines** — Hunting of rhino for their horns
- **Decorative products** — Hunting of elephants for their tusks for making ivory products

This may result in extinction of the species, and increase in the population of its prey.

## Destruction of habitats
### Deforestation
- Trees are being cut down on a massive scale to obtain timber, or to obtain land for agriculture or urban development. This is especially in tropical rainforests.
- It destroys the natural habitats of wildlife and leads to a reduction in biodiversity.

### Monoculture
- Refers to the cultivation of a single crop in a given area.
- Leads to a loss of species, an increase in pest population and destruction of natural habitats.

## Pollution
Pollutants are being released into the environment in harmful amounts as a result of human activities.

### Examples
- **Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels**
  When large amounts of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, it enhances the greenhouse effect and results in global warming.

- **Acid rain caused by sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides**
  Reaction of these gases with water vapour and oxygen in the air form acids, resulting in the formation of acid rain. Acid rain can harm both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

- **Toxic chemicals in industrial sewage (e.g. heavy metal ions – Hg & Pb)**
  Untreated sewage being discharged into rivers or the sea will contaminate the water. Toxic chemicals may be taken up by aquatic organisms and transferred along food chains through feeding.

- **Disposal of solid wastes at landfills**
  As the wastes breakdown, they release methane (also a greenhouse gas) and produce a toxic liquid called leachate. It will contaminate soil and groundwater if it leaks out of landfills.

# Conservation methods
- **Protection of natural habitats**
	- Setting up conservation areas (e.g. national parks)

- **Protection of wildlife**
	- Setting up laws to prohibit hunting of endangered species and trading of their body parts (e.g. ban on ivory trade)
	- Breeding endangered species in zoos and botanical gardens (e.g. pandas)

- **Sustainable management of natural resources**
	- Restricting fishing activities during fishing moratorium to allow fish stocks to replenish

- **Reduction in waste production**
	- Implementing charging schemes for different kinds of waste
	  (e.g. charging for plastic shopping bags)

- **Use of alternative energy sources**
	- Using renewable, environmentally friendly energy sources (e.g. solar energy, wind energy and hydro energy) to replace the use of fossil fuels

- **Pollution control**
	- Controlling emissions from factories and power plants
	- Treating sewage before discharge
