The **trophic level** refers to the feeding position that an organism occupies in a food chain or food web. Similar to a food chain, the first trophic level is occupied by producers, where all other trophic levels consist of consumers.

#### Efficiency of energy flow
Energy transfer between different trophic levels is inefficient. Only a small proportion of energy at one level is available to the next trophic level. Therefore, <u>the number of organisms in each trophic level decreases</u>.

**Methods for energy lost along the food chain**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">As heat</span>
  Organisms lose energy to the surroundings in the form of heat as they carry out cellular respiration. Energy lost in this manner cannot be recycled in the ecosystem. A constant input of energy into the ecosystem from the Sun is needed to sustain life.
 
- <span style="color: lightgreen">As excretory products (e.g. urea)</span>
  Not available to organisms at higher trophic levels.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">As faeces</span>
  Some parts of an organism (e.g. cellulose from plants, bones and hair in mammals) are indigestible. They still store energy but are [[Large intestine#Egestion|egested]] in faeces.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">In uneaten dead bodies</span>
  Some organisms die without being eaten. Its energy is not transferred to higher levels.

> [!note]
> - Energy in excretory products, faeces and uneaten dead bodies become food for decomposers, which break down dead organic matter and release heat energy.
> - A food chain normally does not consist of more than five trophic levels as the fifth trophic level does not get enough energy to support further levels.

**Explaining decreasing number of organisms in higher trophic levels**:
- There is <u>energy lost</u> when energy is transferred to the next higher level.
- <u>Preys (at lower levels) are usually smaller than its predator (at higher levels) in size.</u> The predator needs to eat a large number of prey to get enough energy.
