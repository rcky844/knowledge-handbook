A **habitat** is a physical area where an organism lives with all the necessary conditions for their survival.


A **niche** is the <u>special ecological role each species is adapted to</u> in a community. It is determined by the habitat where the organism lives, food it eats, relationships with other organisms and its effects on the environment.

> [!note]
> Many species share the same habitat, but <u>each species occupies a specific niche</u>.
> No two species can occupy the same niche in the same habitat at the same time. Otherwise, there will be fierce [[Competition]] for resources.
