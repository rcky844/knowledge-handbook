**Sampling and collecting data on abiotic factors** can be used to discover the [[Species diversity|distribution and abundance of organisms]] in the habitat.

#### Sampling
**Sampling** is used to count the number of organisms in a small area to estimate the total number of organisms.

##### Quadrats
**Quadrats** are used in randomly sampling for determining the species abundance.

They are placed randomly on different locations within the area being studied. The number of different kinds of organism in each quadrat is counted and recorded, and a mean value is calculated. The greater the number of quadrat counts, the more reliable the estimate of the number of organisms will be.

**Requirements for using quadrats**:
- They are only suitable for sampling plants, immobile or slow-moving animals.
- The size of the quadrat used depends on the size of the organisms being counted. A larger quadrat is used for larger organisms so that it encloses a reasonable number of individuals.
- If used alone, it is only suitable for uniform habitats (e.g. grassland).

##### Transects
**Transects** are used in systematic sampling to study habitats where some form of gradual change (transition) in populations takes place.

###### Line transect
**Line transecting** can be used to estimate the <u>range of distribution of species in a habitat</u>.

A transect is laid on the study site <u>along a physical gradient</u> (e.g. from upper shore towards lower shore of a wetland). Organisms that touch the transect are identified and recorded.
		
**Limitations**:
- Only organisms that touch the transect are identified and recorded.
- Line transecting does not estimate the abundance of the organisms.

###### Belt transect
**Belt transecting** can be used to estimate both the <u>distribution and abundance of species in a habitat</u>.

A transect is laid on the study site and quadrats are placed continuously along the transect. Alternatively, quadrats can be placed along the transects at fixed intervals. The position of the quadrats and the organisms within the quadrats are recorded.

> [!note]
> The data collected through this method may then be tabulated for further analysis.

**Kite diagrams** can be drawn to show the distribution of organisms along the transect.

##### Processing of data
###### Percentage frequency
**Percentage frequency** is used to find the probability of a species occurring in a quadrat. This is useful for species that is <u>difficult to count</u> (e.g. grasses), and provides information on the <u>general distribution of the species</u> present.

**Formula**:
$\pu{\% frequency} = {\pu{number of quadrats in which the species occurs}\over\pu{total number of quadrats}} \times 100\%$

###### Density
**Density** measures the number of individuals per a specific area of land. This is useful for species that are <u>easy to count and not too numerous</u>.

**Formula**:
$\pu{absolute density} = {\pu{number of individuals of the species in the quadrat}\over\pu{area of the quadrat}}$
$\pu{relative density} = {\pu{number of individuals of the species in the quadrat}\over\pu{number of individuals of all species in the quadrat}} \times 100\%$

> [!note]
> If some individuals are half inside the quadrat, those on two sides of the quadrats are counted as being in, while those on the other two sides are counted as being out.

###### Percentage cover
**Percentage cover** is an estimate of the area within a quadrat that a species covers. It is useful for species that are <u>particularly abundant or difficult to count individually</u> (e.g. mosses, algae).

**Formula**:
$\pu{\% cover} = {\pu{area of quadrat covered by the species}\over\pu{total area of the quadrat}} \times 100\%$

#### Measuring abiotic factors
| Abiotic factor | Instrument / Tool |
| :--: | :--: |
| Light intensity | Light meter (lux) |
| pH | pH meter / pH paper |
| Wind speed | Anemometer |
| Temperature | Thermometer |
| Oxygen | Dissolved oxygen meter |
| Relative humidity | Thermohygeometer |
| Salinity | Refractometer (for water samples) |

- Data loggers can be used to collect data in conjunction with these instruments on abiotic data for ecological studies.
