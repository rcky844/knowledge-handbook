The Sun provides an external source of energy for many ecosystem, which is captured by green plants by [[Photosynthesis]]. The energy flows through the ecosystem from one organism to another in the form of food.

Energy is released through respiration, but some of the energy is lost as heat. Energy is also lost through [[Excretion]] (in urea), [[Large intestine#Egestion|egestion]] (in faeces) and as uneaten body parts (e.g. bones) when the organism dies.

> [!note]
> There is no cycling of energy in an ecosystem. Energy lost cannot be recycled by the ecosystem.

#### Food chains
Consider an example: grass → grasshopper → sparrow (where → means eaten by)
- The food chain represents the direction of energy and material flow from one organism to the next.
- Organisms can also be classified based on their roles in a food chain.

##### Classification of organisms
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Producer</span>
  At the start of any food chains is an [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Autotrophs|autotroph]], which can make its own food.
	- **Examples**:
	  **Terrestrial**: green plants
	  **Aquatic**: algae, photosynthetic protists, bacteria

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Consumer</span>
  [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Heterotrophs|Heterotrophs]] that feed on other organisms for food and energy.
	- **Food chain**: Producer → Primary consumer
	  → Secondary consumer → Tertiary consumer

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Decomposer</span>
	- Organisms that obtain nutrients and energy by breaking down the wastes or dead bodies of producers and consumers.
	- They secrete enzymes onto dead material to break down organic matter into inorganic nutrients.
	- They may not always be shown in food chains, but play important roles in material cycling, returning nutrients to the environment for reuse by producers.
	- **Examples**: <u>saprophytes – fungi, bacteria</u>

#### Food webs
![[food_webs.webp|380]]
**Food webs** are similar to food chains, but they can show multiple food chains linked together.
