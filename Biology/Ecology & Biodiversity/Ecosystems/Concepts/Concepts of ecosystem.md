## Energy flow & material cycling
*See also: [[Energy flow & material cycling]]*

**Energy flow** is the flow of energy as chemical energy in food between organisms.
- Energy cannot be recycled and is lost from the ecosystem in the form of heat.
- A constant input of energy is needed. Most ecosystems obtain energy from sunlight through [[photosynthesis]] by plants.

**Material cycling** occurs between the biotic and abiotic components.
- Elements in an organism will be returned to the environment when it dies, and it will be taken up by other organisms in a cycle.

> [!warning]
> There is no cycling of energy in an ecosystem. Energy lost cannot be recycled by the ecosystem.
