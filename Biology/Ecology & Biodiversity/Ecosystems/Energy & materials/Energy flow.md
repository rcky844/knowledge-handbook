**Energy flow** is the flow of energy through organisms within an ecosystem in the form of food, in which organisms are classified as <u>producers and consumers</u> by their ecological roles.

# Classification & trophic levels
Different organisms occupy different <span class="hi-blue">trophic levels</span> in a food chain, where the first trophic level is occupied by producers, and all other trophic levels consist of consumers.

*Classification of organisms*:
- **Producers**: Occupy the start of all food chains, [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Autotrophs|autotrophic]] in nature.
- **Consumers**: [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Heterotrophs|Heterotrophic]] in nature, consume other organisms for energy.
- **Decomposers**: Obtains energy through the break down of dead organisms.

# Transfer of energy
## Source
- Energy in many ecosystems come from the Sun, which can be captured through [[photosynthesis]] by green plants.
- The energy from plants flow through the ecosystem in the form of food.

*Feeding behaviours of organisms*:
- **Carnivores**: Organism that mostly eats meat, or the flesh of animals.
- **Herbivores**: Organisms that feeds mostly on plants.
- **Cellular**: [[Phagocytosis]]

## Loss / sink
Energy transfer between different trophic levels is <u>inefficient</u>, only a small proportion of energy at one trophic level is available to the next, so the number of organisms in higher levels are lower.

- **As heat**
  Energy is lost as heat from organisms via respiration.

- **As excretory products** (e.g. urea)
  Energy lost occurs through [[excretion]], it is not available to organisms of higher trophic levels.

- **As faeces**
  Some parts of an organisms are indigestible (e.g. cellulose from plants, bones and hairs in mammals). While they still store energy, they are [[Large intestines#Egestion|egested]] in faeces.

- **In uneaten dead bodies**
  Some organisms die without being eaten, with the energy not transferred to higher levels.

*Reasons for decreasing number of organisms in higher trophic levels*:
- There is <span class="hi-blue">energy lost</span> when energy is transferred to the next higher level.
- Preys (at lower levels) are usually <span class="hi-green">smaller than its predator</span> (at higher levels) in size. The predator needs to <u>eat a large number of prey to get enough energy</u>.

> [!warning]
> There is no cycling of energy in an ecosystem. Energy lost cannot be recycled by the ecosystem.

> [!tip]
> - Energy in excretory products, faeces and uneaten dead bodies become food for decomposers, which break down dead organic matter and release heat energy.
> - A food chain normally does not consist of more than five trophic levels as the fifth trophic level does not get enough energy to support further levels.

## Representations
### Food chains
*Example*: grass → grasshopper → sparrow
↪ Represents the <u>direction of energy flow</u> from one organism to the next.

### Food webs
*Example*: (formed by multiple food chains)

### Ecological pyramids
*See also: [[Ecological pyramids]]*

**Ecological pyramids** show the flow of energy among organisms between trophic levels, with respect to the size of the population or amount of biomass.

# Detritivores / Decomposer
**Detritivores** are organisms that obtain nutrients and energy by breaking down wastes or dead bodies of organisms. They secrete [[enzymes]] onto dead material to break down organic matter into inorganic nutrients.

They may not always be shown in food chains, but play important roles in material cycling by returning nutrients to the environment for reuse by producers.

*Examples*: saprophytes – fungi, bacteria
