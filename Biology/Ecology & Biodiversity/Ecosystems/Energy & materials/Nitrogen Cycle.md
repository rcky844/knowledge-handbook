# Transfer of nitrogen along food chain
1. <span class="hi-green">Nitrogenous organic compounds</span> (e.g. proteins, DNA) is transferred along the food chain from producers to consumers through <span class="hi-blue">feeding</span>.

# Adding nitrogen to the soil
> [!tip] Nitrification
> Nitrifying bacteria in the soil convert ammonium compounds to nitrites ($\ce{NO2-}$) and to nitrates ($\ce{NO3-}$).

2. <span class="hi-blue">Decomposition</span> of organic waste and dead bodies of organisms by decomposers (e.g. putrefying bacteria and fungi) converts nitrogen to <span class="hi-blue">ammonium compounds</span>.
3. <span class="hi-blue">Lightning</span> combines nitrogen in the atmosphere with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides ($\ce{NO_x}$), which dissolve in rain water and form nitrates ($\ce{NO3-}$) in the soil.

4. <span class="hi-blue">Nitrogen fixing bacteria</span> (free-living in soil or lie in the <span class="hi-blue">root nodules</span> of <u>leguminous plants</u> (e.g. pea, soybean)) convert <span class="hi-green">nitrogen gas to ammonium compounds</span> and supply nitrogenous compounds to the plants. The ammonium compounds present in them are released by decomposition when they die and converted into nitrates by <span class="hi-blue">nitrification</span>.

> [!note] Regenerative farming
> Farmers who implement regenerative farming may first plant <u>leguminous plants</u> to increase the vitality and health of the farmland. This helps build soil health, diversify rotations, and allow enough time in the fall for growers to be able to plant a cover crop.

# Removing nitrogen from the soil
5. Producers (plants) <span class="hi-green">take up nitrogen (mineral) from the soil</span>, mainly in the form of <span class="hi-blue">nitrates</span> ($\ce{NO3-}$), to make proteins and other nitrogenous compounds.
6. Under *[[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] conditions*, <span class="hi-blue">denitrifying bacteria</span> in the soil convert nitrates to nitrogen gas (by <span class="hi-blue">denitrification</span>), which is then released into the atmosphere.

# Roles of bacterium in the nitrogen cycle
- **Nitrifying bacteria**: Converting ammonium compounds to nitrates or nitrites.
- **Denitrifying bacteria**: Converting nitrates to nitrogen gas.
- **Nitrogen fixing bacteria**: Converting nitrogen gas to ammonium compounds.
