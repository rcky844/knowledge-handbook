**Ecological pyramids** show the distribution of materials and energy along the <span class="hi-blue">trophic levels</span> of an ecosystem. They are represented by <span class="hi-blue">bar charts</span>, which can be <span class="hi-green">upright or inverted</span>.

In ecological pyramids, the <span class="hi-blue">producer</span> always occupies the <span class="hi-green">bottom of the pyramid</span>. Energy is [[Energy flow#Loss / sink|lost to the surroundings]] from one trophic level to the next so less and less energy is available to organisms at higher trophic levels.

> [!tip]
> - An organism <u>may belong to more than one trophic level</u>, it cannot easily be assigned to a single trophic level.
> - Energy flow to decomposers is often not shown in ecological pyramids.

# Pyramid of numbers
**Pyramid of numbers** shows the number of organisms at each trophic level in an ecosystem in a given area at any one time.

- *Advantages*: Relatively <u>easy to collect data</u> and information to construct pyramids of numbers.
- *Disadvantages*: <u>Size of each organism</u> is not taken into account, as each organism is counted irrespective of its size.
- *Exceptional cases*:
  ![[py_of_num_exp.webp|200]]
  This pyramid is <span class="hi-blue">inverted</span>. The producer has a much <span class="hi-green">higher biomass than the consumer</span>, and so the producer can support many consumers.

# Pyramid of biomass
**Pyramid of biomass** shows the total mass of organisms (often [[Growth parameters#Dry mass|dry mass]]) at each trophic level in a given area at one time.

![[py_of_biomass.webp|200]]

- *Advantages*:
	- It can more accurately represent the <span class="hi-green">amount of energy</span> passed on at each trophic level.
	- The amount of energy stored in an organism is proportional to the amount of living material in its body.

- *Disadvantages*:
  It is more <u>difficult to collect data</u> and information to construct pyramids of numbers. ([[Growth parameters#Dry mass]])

- *Exceptional cases*:
  ![[py_of_biomass_exp.webp|220]]
  This pyramid is <span class="hi-blue">inverted</span>. Biomass of producers (phytoplankton) at any time point is small as they are eaten rapidly by the consumers (zooplanktons), but they reproduce rapidly so the total biomass produced is adequate to support their consumers.
