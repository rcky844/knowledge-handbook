# Removal of carbon dioxide from environment
1. Plants (producers) take up carbon dioxide by [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon is <span class="hi-green">fixed into organic compounds</span> stored in their bodies.

# Transfer of carbon along food chains
2. Carbon compounds are transferred along the <span class="hi-blue">food chain</span> from producers to consumers through <span class="hi-blue">feeding</span>.
3. Carbon compounds in organisms are released into the environment (for decomposers) through <span class="hi-blue">excretion / egestion / death</span>.

# Release of carbon dioxide to the environment
4. [[Respiration]] of producers and consumers breaks down organic compounds and releases carbon dioxide.
5. <span class="hi-blue">Decomposition</span> of dead organic matter by decomposers (e.g. putrefying bacteria and fungi) releases carbon dioxide.
6. <span class="hi-blue">Burning fossil fuels</span> releases carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
7. <span class="hi-blue">Weathering of limestone</span> (reaction with carbonic acid in rainwater) releases carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.

> [!info] Formation of fossil fuels
> Plants and animals that died and are buried underground may turn into fossil fuels (e.g. coal and oil) over millions of years.

> [!info] Formation of limestones
> - Some marine organisms have shells made up of calcium carbonate. When they die, they sink to the seabed and their shell eventually form limestone (a kind of sedimentary rock).
> - Limestones may become lifted up to the land by Earth movements.
