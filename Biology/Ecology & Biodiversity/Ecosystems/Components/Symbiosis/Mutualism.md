**Mutualism** is a type of <span class="hi-blue">symbiosis</span> where two species <span class="hi-green">benefit by living together</span>.

|     Party     | Benefit / Harmed |
| :-----------: | :--------------: |
| **Species 1** |        +         |
| **Species 2** |        +         |

*Examples*:
- **Lichen** (on tree trunks or rock surfaces)
  Lichen carries out [[photosynthesis]] to produce organic food for itself and the fungus, while fungus provides <span class="hi-green">anchorage</span>, absorbs water and minerals, and protects the lichen.

- **Sea anemones & Hermit crabs**
  Sea anemones obtain food remains from hermit crab and are carried about by them, and provides protection to the hermit crabs, which posses stinging cells on their tentacles for defence against predators.

- **Herbivores** (e.g. cows, sheep)
  Herbivores rely on mutualistic bacteria living in their intestines to break down the cellulose in the plants they eat, while bacteria receive shelter and a steady supply of food from the host.
