**Parasitism** is a type of <span class="hi-blue">symbiosis</span> where the parasite benefits by living on or inside the host, but the host is harmed.

|    Party     | Benefit / Harmed |
| :----------: | :--------------: |
| **Parasite** |        +         |
|   **Host**   |        -         |

*Examples*:
- **Dodder**
	- It has <span class="hi-green">no chlorophyll</span> and cannot produce food by [[photosynthesis]]. Instead, they absorb food from host plants on which it grows.
	- Host plants are deprived of nutrients and becomes weak and vulnerable to diseases, while it can also spread plant diseases from one host to another.

- **Ticks**
	- Ticks are arthropods (invertebrates with jointed legs) that feed on the blood of their hosts (e.g. mammals, birds).

- **Tapeworms**
	- They live in the small intestine of mammals (e.g. humans, pigs) to absorb digested food from hosts.
	- Hosts are harmed by the <span class="hi-green">loss of nutrients</span>.

- **Barnacles and crabs**
	- A barnacle may root itself inside a crab and live inside it, but it does not kill the crab.
