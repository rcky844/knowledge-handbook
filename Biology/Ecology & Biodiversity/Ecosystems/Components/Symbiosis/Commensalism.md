*Examples*:
- **Epiphytes** (e.g. orchids)
  Grow on trunks or branches of other plants to obtain more sunlight, only using moisture and nutrients from the air.

- **Remoras**
  Use a sucker-like structure to attach to the body of a shark, benefiting from transportation, protection from predators and the scraps of food left over when the shark eats its prey.

- **Cattle egrets**
  Ride on the back of cattle to feed on insects stirred up from the grass as the cattle graze.
