**Ecological succession** is a series of progressive changes in the composition of a biotic community (species & habitat) over time.

A <span class="hi-blue">climax community</span> is a stable state reached when the habitat <span class="hi-green">supports the most diverse community</span> it is capable of. It is only replaced when there are drastic changes (e.g. natural disasters, human disturbances).

# Primary succession
**Primary succession** occurs in a barren area where <span class="hi-green">no communities existed previously</span>, with only bare rocks present. The process of primary succession can <u>take hundreds of years</u> (longer).

*Examples*:
- Lava flows from volcano and hardens
- Glacier retreats

<span class="hi-blue">Pioneer species</span> are the <span class="hi-green">first species to colonize</span> a barren area, forming the <span class="hi-blue">pioneer community</span> and modify the environment gradually to provide suitable conditions for colonization by a succession of communities.

*Process of primary succession*:
1. **Bare rocks**
   The environment is <span class="hi-blue">abiotic</span>.

2. **Lichens and mosses**
	- Spores of lichens and mosses are carried to bare rocks <span class="hi-green">by wind</span>. They colonize rock surfaces and form the <span class="hi-blue">pioneer community</span>.
	- Soil gradually develops as rocks break down and <span class="hi-green">organic matter accumulates</span>.

3. **Ferns and grasses**
	- The soil becomes <u>thick</u> enough to support ferns and grasses (smaller plants).
	- As they grow, they replace the lichens and mosses and become the <span class="hi-blue">dominant species</span>.
	- They provide <span class="hi-green">food and shelter</span> for insects (smaller animals).

4. **Shrubs**
	- Soil continues to form. Larger plants like shrubs start to grow.
	- Shrubs grow over ferns and grasses and become the <span class="hi-blue">dominant species</span>.
	- More animals, such as birds and small mammals, are attracted to the habitat.
	- <span class="hi-blue">Humus</span> formed from the decomposition of organic wastes and dead bodies of organisms enrich the soil.

5. **Trees**
	- The soil becomes <u>thick and rich</u> enough to support the growth of trees.
	- The canopy of trees over-shadow the shrubs and they become the <span class="hi-blue">dominant species</span>. The habitat becomes a <span class="hi-green">woodland</span>.
	- More animals join the community, a <span class="hi-blue">climax community</span> is reached.

# Secondary succession
**Secondary succession** involves the <span class="hi-green">restoration of the community</span> after a <u>major disturbance</u>.

*Examples*:
- Abandoned agricultural fields
- After wildfires, storms or floods

*Differences to primary succession*:
- Starts with a <span class="hi-green">more complex pioneer community</span> (e.g. annual herbaceous plants)
	- Soil may contain seeds, roots and underground vegetative parts of plants. <span class="hi-green">They are not damaged in the disturbance.</span>
	- They can grow and develop into new plants when conditions become favourable.
- Occurs <span class="hi-blue">more rapidly</span> as soil already exists.
