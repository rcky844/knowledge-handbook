# Habitat & niche
- A <span class="hi-blue">habitat</span> is a <span class="hi-green">physical area</span> where an organism lives with all the necessary <u>conditions</u> for their survival.
- A <span class="hi-blue">niche</span> is the special <span class="hi-green">ecological role</span> each species is adapted to in a community. It is determined by the habitat where the organism lives, food it eats, relationships with other organisms and its effects on the environment.

> [!tip]
> Many species share the same habitat, but each species <span class="hi-green">occupies a specific niche</span>.
> No two species can occupy the same niche in the same habitat at the same time. Otherwise, there will be fierce [[competition]] for resources.

# Species diversity
![[species_diversity.webp]]

*Factors*:
- **Species richness**: <span class="hi-green">Number</span> of different species in a community.
- **Relative abundance**: <span class="hi-green">Proportion</span> of the community that each species occupies.

*Dominant species*: Most abundant species (or occupies the highest biomass)
- The <u>higher</u> the species richness and the more <u>similar</u> the relative abundances of different species, the greater the species diversity.
- They have a strong influence on the composition and diversity of the community.

# Relationships between organisms (symbiosis)
1. [[Predation]]
2. [[Competition]]
3. [[Commensalism]]
4. [[Mutualism]]
5. [[Parasitism]]
