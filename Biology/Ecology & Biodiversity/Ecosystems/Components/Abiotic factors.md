# Light
## Rate of photosynthesis
- **Terrestrial habitats**
	- Plants tend to *reach a higher position* (by <span class="hi-green">growing tall</span> or <span class="hi-green">climbing up other plants</span>) so that they are not blocked from sunlight. (e.g. Ivy)
	- Plants growing in shady areas have *larger leaves* to absorb more light for [[photosynthesis]] and/or more <span class="hi-blue">chlorophyll</span> to absorb more sunlight, and its leaves appear darker.

- **Aquatic habitats**
	- Light intensity determines the *distribution of plants*, decreasing with increasing water depth.
	- Aquatic plants often *live in shallow waters* to receive more light got [[photosynthesis]].

## Flowering of plants
Relative length of daylight and night-time can affect the <u>flowering of plants</u>.
- Some flower during late spring or early summer. (e.g. Iris)
- Some flower during late summer or autumn. (e.g. Chrysanthemum)

## Activities of animals
- <span class="hi-blue">Diurnal animals</span> are active during the day and rest at night.
- <span class="hi-blue">Nocturnal animals</span> are only active at night. They are adapted to live in dark environments. (e.g. owls, bats)

# Temperature
<span class="hi-green">Metabolic and structural adaptations</span> of an organism determines the temperature range it may survive in.

## Distribution of plants
- Some survive in <u>cold regions</u>.
  (e.g. pine trees, wheat, cabbages)
- Some grow in <u>warm tropical or subtropical regions</u>.
  (e.g. bananas, pineapples, sugar cane)

## Seasonal activities of plants
- [[Germination of seeds]]
- [[Growth and development in flowering plants|Flowering]]
- [[Dispersal of seeds and fruits|Fruiting]]

## Regulation of body temperature
- **Homoiotherms** (e.g. mammals, birds)
	- They can maintain a fairly constant *body temperature* by physiological means.
	- They can *remain active* irrespective of the environmental temperature.
	- They can inhibit a *wider geographical range* with a <u>higher chance of survival</u>.

> [!tip] Birds as homoiotherms
> Birds are able to maintain the body temperature by muscular contractions during flapping.

- **Poikilotherms** (e.g. fish, amphibians, reptiles)
	- They cannot maintain a constant body temperature, which varies with *environmental temperature*.
	- These animal are <u>restricted</u> to areas with a *narrower temperature range*.

## Structural adaptations in animals
- **Cold climates** (e.g. seals)
  They have a <u>thick layer of subcutaneous fat</u>, which helps <span class="hi-green">reduce heat loss</span> from the body and acts as an <span class="hi-green">energy reserve</span>.

- **Hot climates** (e.g. elephants)
  They have <u>larger ears and longer limbs</u>, giving them a <span class="hi-green">larger surface area to promote heat loss</span>.

## Behavioural methods in animals
- **Hibernation** (e.g. amphibians, reptiles, mammals)
  Metabolic rate becomes so slow that energy usage and heat loss can be reduced greatly.

- **Migration**
  Species of birds and butterflies migrate to warmer regions during the winter.

# Water availability
Rainfall is the major source of water for terrestrial organisms, while humidity would affect the rate of water loss.

## Adaptations for living in dry habitats
The types of organisms below are adapted to survive in environments with little water (e.g. deserts): 
- **Xerophytes** (e.g. cacti)
	- They have an *extensive root system* to absorb water from a <span class="hi-green">large area</span>.
	- They may *store water in their stems*.
	- They may be covered with *a thick cuticle* or have their *leaves modified into spines* to <span class="hi-green">reduce water loss</span> by [[transpiration]].

- **Desert kangaroo rats**
	- They obtain most of their *water from metabolism*.
	- They have *highly effective kidneys* that <u>produce very concentrated urine</u> to <span class="hi-green">reduce water loss through urination</span>.
	- Their <span class="hi-blue">nasal passages</span> help *reabsorb moisture* from exhaled air.
	- They are *nocturnal* and stay in cool holes during the day to reduce water loss by sweating.

# Wind
It affects the distribution and growth of plants.
- Some depends on wind for [[pollination]] and [[Dispersal of seeds and fruits|dispersal of seeds]].
  (e.g. cedar tree, dandelion)
- Wind direction affects the <u>direction of growth</u> of plants.
  (e.g. trees)

In windy conditions, plants are likely to lose a lot of water through [[transpiration]]. They may have <span class="hi-green">fleshy leaves with a thick cuticle</span> to prevent excessive water loss.

# Water current
## Protection from strong waves
Shore animals have <span class="hi-blue">hard shells</span> to protect them from strong waves.
- Barnacles secrete a cement-like substance to <span class="hi-green">attach to rock surfaces</span>.
- Chitons and limpets have <span class="hi-blue">muscular foot</span> to hold onto rocks.
- Crabs may <span class="hi-green">hide</span> under rocks.

## Fast-flowing streams
- They have a <u>streamlined and flattened body</u>, swimming against water current with <span class="hi-green">little resistance</span>.
- They have their mouth or fins modified to function like suckers, holding onto rocks.

# Salinity
- **Freshwater habitat**
  Organisms face a constant influx of water from the surrounding hypotonic medium, and has to remove excessive water from their bodies.

- **Salt water (sea water)** (e.g. mangrove plants)
  Marine organisms has to remove excessive salts and reduce water loss from their bodes.

> [!tip] Water potential and osmosis
> Salinity affects the water potential of the environment, and the amount of water and minerals an organism can obtain from the environment.

> [!info] Mangrove plants
> - Their roots are immersed in sea water.
> - Their leaves have salt glands to allow them to maintain osmotic balance by removing excessive salts.
> - Their leaves have thick cuticles to reduce water loss (by osmosis).

# Oxygen concentration
## In water
- **Temperature**
  When temperature increases, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases, concentration of dissolved oxygen decreases.

- **Water movements**
  Concentration of dissolved oxygen increases when water flows more quickly, as turbulence and splashing can bring more water in contact with oxygen in air.

- **Organic matter**
  Concentration of dissolved oxygen decreases with more organic matter in water because the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms uses oxygen.

> [!info] Mangrove plants
> - They have aerial roots that grow above the waterlogged soil, with many lenticels to maximize the gas exchange with air.

> [!info] Aquatic insects
> - Water scorpions can breathe through a breathing tube that extend out of the water.

## Density of species
- **Cold, fast-moving water** (e.g. trout)
  These regions have higher concentration of dissolved oxygen, and more species that need high concentrations of dissolved oxygen.

- **Warm, still water** (e.g. carp)
  These regions have lower concentration of dissolved oxygen, and more species that are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations.

> [!tip] Species diversity
> Concentration of dissolved oxygen determines the species and the number of organisms an aquatic habitat can support.

# Soil
Soil provides a place for <span class="hi-green">elongation of roots and anchorage</span>. Different properties of soil affects the types of animals present in the habitat.

## Size of soil particles
- **Sand**
  Made up of relatively <span class="hi-green">large soil particles</span> with <span class="hi-green">large air spaces</span>, and it cannot provide enough <span class="hi-blue">anchorage</span> for large plants.

- **Silt & clay**
  Made up of <span class="hi-green">smaller particles</span> and are <span class="hi-green">more closely packed</span>. When flooded with water, they become <span class="hi-blue">waterlogged</span> easily, so the oxygen content becomes very low (poorly aerated).

## Nutrient content
- Nutrients in soil mainly come from <span class="hi-green">organic matter</span> in animal droppings and the remains of <span class="hi-green">dead organism</span>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Humus</span> formed from the decomposition of organic matter by detritivores (animals feeding on decomposing organic matter) and microorganisms help <span class="hi-green">retain moisture</span> and improve <span class="hi-green">fertility of soil</span>.

## Soil pH
Soil pH affects the solubility of inorganic ions in soil water and the amount of nutrients available to plants. (Optimal range: 5.5 ~ 7)
