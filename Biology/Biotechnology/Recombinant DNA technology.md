![[Genetic engineering]]

**Recombinant DNA technology** are techniques for <u>combining DNA molecules</u>.

**Terminology**:
- *Plasmids*: Small, circular DNA molecules found in bacteria separate from the bacterial chromosome and can replicate independently.
- *Gene of interest*: Fragment of the required DNA isolated from a donor cell.
- *Vector*: DNA molecule used for transferring into a <span style="color: skyblue">host cell</span>, usually a <span style="color: skyblue">plasmids</span>.
- *Restriction enzymes*: Produced by bacteria as a <span style="color: orange">defense mechanism</span> against <span style="color: skyblue">bacteriophages</span> by <span style="color: lightgreen">cutting up viral DNA before it can be integrated into the bacteria chromosome and replicates</span>.

#### Process
- **Isolation of gene of interest and vectors**
	- DNA fragments containing the <span style="color: violet">gene of interest</span> (gene coding for particular proteins) are isolated from donor cells.
	- <span style="color: violet">Vectors</span> (plasmids) are isolated from bacteria.

- **Restriction**
	- DNA fragments containing <span style="color: lightgreen">gene of interest are cut using restriction enzymes</span>, which act as molecular scissors to cut DNA at specific base sequences.
	- The <span style="color: lightgreen">same restriction enzyme is used to cut open the plasmids</span>.

- **Insertion of gene of interest**
	- *Ligation*: Gene of interest is inserted into an open plasmid, joined together with the help of <span style="color: skyblue">DNA ligase</span>, acting like molecular glue.
	- Resulting DNA molecule is called a <span style="color: skyblue">recombinant plasmid</span>.

#### Applications
> [!tip]
> An organism that contains genes from another species is called a <u>transgenic organism</u>, or a <u>genetically modified organism (GMO)</u>.
