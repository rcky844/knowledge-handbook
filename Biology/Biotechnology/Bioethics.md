**Bioethics** focuses on ethical issues and other concerns cased by advanced in biological sciences and medicine.

# Determining factors
*Areas of concern*:
- **Ethical issues**: Moral values, human rights, animal rights, religious beliefs
- **Health issues**: Potential hazards to human health
- **Legal issues**: Government's policy making, law making and enforcement
- **Social issues**: Effects on society, equality and fairness
- **Economic issues**: Costs of research and development, application of biotechnology
- **Environmental issues**: Effects of biotechnology on environment, biodiversity, ecological balance

*Factors for consideration*:
- <span class="hi-green">Risks</span> associated with the technology
- <span class="hi-green">Unintended consequences</span>
- <span class="hi-green">Benefits</span> of the technology
- Ways to actively <span class="hi-green">minimize risks</span>
- Whether the new technology should be used

# Genetically modified food
*See also: [[Genetically modified organisms]]*

*Ethical issues*:
- Creating GMOs <span class="hi-green">may violate the laws of nature</span>, and some religions are against GMOs as they believe <span class="hi-green">humans should not play the role of God</span>.
- Some people are concerned about sources of <span class="hi-blue">foreign genes</span> in GM foods.
  **Example**: <span class="hi-orange">Vegetarians</span> may not accept vegetables containing animal genes.
- GM animals may suffer <span class="hi-green">poor health and reduced lifespan</span>, raising concerns about animal welfare.

*Health issues*:
- GM foods may cause <span class="hi-green">unknown long-term health effects</span> (e.g. <span class="hi-orange">allergic reactions</span>)
- <span class="hi-orange">Antibiotic resistance genes</span> in GM foods may transfer to bacteria in human intestines, producing [[Antibiotics#Development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria|antibiotic-resistant 'superbugs']] and causing <span class="hi-green">incurable diseases</span>. (low chance)

*Social and economic issues*:
- GM crops have higher yields with lower production costs than non-GM crops. This <span class="hi-green">reduces the competitiveness of farmers who grow non-GM crops</span> and affects their livelihood.
- Poorer farmers <span class="hi-blue">may not be able to afford expensive GM seeds</span> (due to patents) while wealthier ones can. This may <span class="hi-green">widen the wealth gap</span> between developing and developed countries.
- GM crops may be <span class="hi-blue">genetically modified to grow for only one season</span> and afterwards produce sterile seeds that do not germinate. Farmers would be <span class="hi-green">forced to buy new seeds from the manufacturer every year</span>, so farmers may benefit little from growing GM crops.

*Environmental issues*:
- GMOs may <span class="hi-green">out-compete wild types and replace them</span>, leading to a <span class="hi-blue">decrease in biodiversity</span> and may <span class="hi-blue">upset the ecological balance</span>.
- When GMOs are grown in open areas, pollen grains from the GM crops <span class="hi-green">may pollinate non-GM crops</span>, causing <span class="hi-orange">genetic pollution</span>.
- There is a risk of <span class="hi-blue">gene transfer from GM crops to weeds</span>, resulting in <span class="hi-orange">'superweeds'</span> which may spread uncontrollably.
- <span class="hi-orange">Toxins</span> produced by pest-resistant crops <span class="hi-green">may accumulate along the food chain</span> and cause <span class="hi-blue">poisoning in consumers at higher trophic levels</span>.
- <span class="hi-orange">Mass farming</span> of pest-resistant crops may <span class="hi-green">speed up the evolution of pesticide resistance</span> in insect populations.

# Cloning
*Main article: [[Animal and plant cloning]]*

*Ethical issues*:
- Some people are against cloning as they believe <span class="hi-green">humans should not play the role of God</span> and <span class="hi-blue">manipulate the natural reproductive process</span> of organisms.
- <span class="hi-orange">Animal cloning</span> (using nuclear transfer) has a <span class="hi-green">low success rate.</span> The clones <span class="hi-green">may develop abnormally</span>, and may cause suffering to the animal clones.

*Ethical issues* (humans):
- Human cloning will <span class="hi-green">involve selection of better fitted individuals</span> to be cloned, and promoting <span class="hi-blue">elitism and discrimination</span> against the less fit.
- It is <span class="hi-green">difficult to define the identity</span> of the clone.
- Human cloning may cause <span class="hi-green">confusion in family structures and relationships</span>.
- Clones may be treated as inferior class of human beings, labors or commercial products to be traded, <span class="hi-green">lowering the value of human lives</span>.
- Using <span class="hi-orange">organs</span> from human clones for <span class="hi-orange">transplantation</span> is morally unacceptable because this kills the clones who are also human beings.

*Economic issues*:
- <span class="hi-green">Cost of cloning animals is high</span>, it should be spent on more pressing and less controversial studies.
  **Example**: If cloning is used on endangered species due to loss of habitat, the funds should be spent on conserving habitats instead.

*Environmental issues*:
- Extensive cloning <span class="hi-blue">reduces genetic variations</span>. The population of clones may be <span class="hi-green">more susceptible to diseases or changes in the environment</span>.
- <span class="hi-green">Biodiversity is reduced.</span> Genetic variations required for [[evolution]] will be reduced.

# Human Genome Project
*Main article: [[Human Genome Project]]*

*Ethical issues*:
- Genetic testing may cause <span class="hi-green">unnecessary psychological burdens</span>.
- People may <span class="hi-green">live in distress</span> after they had been diagnosed for carrying <span class="hi-orange">disease-related genes</span>.
- There will be a debate on the types of diseases applicable for using <span class="hi-blue">genetic screening</span> (life-threatening diseases or milder diseases).

*Legal issues*:
-  Disputes may arise about the <span class="hi-green">ownership of genetic information</span>. People are concerned about the <span class="hi-green">privacy of genetic information</span>.

*Social issues*:
- Knowing a personâ€™s genetic information may cause <span class="hi-green">discrimination and social inequality</span> (e.g. unequal opportunities for education and jobs).

# Gene therapy
*Main article: [[Gene therapy]]*

*Ethical issues*:
- <span class="hi-orange">Undesirable genes</span> may not be eliminated from the gene pool by [[Theory of natural selection|natural selection]] and be <span class="hi-green">passed on to further generations</span>.
- Gene therapy might be <span class="hi-blue">misused</span> to <span class="hi-green">enhance appearance or improve athletic performance</span>.
- Gene therapy may be <span class="hi-blue">misused</span> to <span class="hi-green">modify gametes so that parents can choose desirable characteristics for their offspring</span>.

*Health issues*:
- The use of <span class="hi-orange">viral vectors</span> may cause severe immune reactions in patients, as it may become <span class="hi-green">regain the ability to cause diseases</span> / pathogenic again.
- The new genes may be <span class="hi-green">wrongly delivered to non-target cells or inappropriately expressed</span>. New genes inserted into the genome may <span class="hi-blue">affect the expression of existing genes and cause cancers</span>.
- <span class="hi-orange">Somatic cell gene therapy</span> <span class="hi-green">does not offer a permanent cure</span>, the cells containing the therapeutic genes may <u>die</u>, or the <u>genes may degenerate</u>, and the diseases may reappear again as a result.

*Legal issues*:
- <span class="hi-green">Laws</span> may be needed to <span class="hi-blue">prevent abuse / misuse</span> of <span class="hi-orange">gene therapy</span>.
- <span class="hi-green">Laws</span> may be needed to <span class="hi-blue">ensure consent to gene therapy</span> may be given only by a patient who is <u>fully informed and capable of making decisions</u>.

*Social issues*:
- <span class="hi-green">Cost of gene therapy is high</span>, most people cannot afford treatment. <span class="hi-blue">Social inequality</span> will become worse.

*Economic issue*:
- Huge amount of money is spend on research.

# Stem cell therapy
*Main article: [[Stem cell therapy]]*

*Ethical issues*:
- Obtaining stem cells from early embryos results in the <span class="hi-green">destruction of the embryos</span>. It is controversial as it may be equivalent to <span class="hi-green">killing human life</span>, raising issues about whether or not embryos have <span class="hi-orange">human rights</span>, and whether the sacrifice is justified.

*Health issues*:
- Stem cells may <span class="hi-green">divide uncontrollably and become cancerous</span> in patients.
- The cells grown from <span class="hi-blue">embryonic stem cells</span> may cause an [[Active immunity & Passive immunity|immune response]] and <span class="hi-orange">rejection</span> in patients.

*Legal issues*:
- Laws are needed to <span class="hi-blue">prevent usage in unauthorized procedures</span> (e.g. human reproductive cloning).
- Some people believe that embryos <span class="hi-green">should not be created for the sole purpose of medical research</span>.

*Social issues*:
- <span class="hi-green">Social inequality will worsen</span> if only wealthy people can afford stem cell therapy.
- Some people are concerned that the <span class="hi-blue">misuse of stem cells</span> may lead to <span class="hi-green">trading of embryos or the tissues or organs developed from stem cells</span>.
