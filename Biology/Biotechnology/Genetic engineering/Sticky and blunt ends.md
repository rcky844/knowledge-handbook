Restriction enzymes can produce different **DNA ends** when they cut across DNA. They are described as "sticky" or "blunt" based on the shape of the complementary strands at the terminus.

# Blunt ends
**Blunt ends** are produced when restriction enzymes make a <span class="hi-blue">straight cut</span> across the DNA.

*Example*:
```
5'-GATCTGACTGATGCGTATGCTAGT-3'
3'-CTAGACTGACTACGCATACGATCA-5'
```

# Sticky ends
**Sticky ends** (<span class="hi-green">single-stranded with unpaired bases</span>) can pair up with another sticky end with a <span class="hi-blue">complementary</span> base sequence.

*Example*:
```
5'-ATCTGACT        GATGCGTATGCT-3'
3'-TAGACTGACTACG        CATACGA-5'
```
