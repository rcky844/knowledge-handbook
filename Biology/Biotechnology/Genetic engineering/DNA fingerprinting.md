**DNA fingerprinting** is a technique used for identification of individuals.

The human DNA contains highly variable regions with repetitive base sequences. They can serve as markers for generating patterns of bands called DNA fingerprints.

#### Gel electrophoresis
**Gel electrophoresis** is a method for separating DNA fragments <span style="color: lightgreen">based on their size</span>.

**Design**:
- DNA is placed at the negative end (cathoide) of the gel. As they are negatively charged, they move towards the positive end (anode).
- Smaller fragments move through the pores of the gel more easily, and move further than larger ones in a given time, separating them according to their size.
- The DNA is stained with a dye or labeled with a radioactive marker as it is colourless.
