**DNA fingerprinting**, also **DNA profiling**, is a technique used for <u>identifying individuals using their DNA profiles</u>.

#### Principles
##### Variable number tandem repeats
There are **variable number tandem repeats** (VNTRs) in different loci of the non-coding DNA due to the phenomenon of <span style="color: orange">length polymorphism</span>.
- Each VNTR contains a variable number of short repetitive sequences of nucleotides, which varies greatly among individuals. This results in <span style="color: lightgreen">different lengths</span> of VNTRs.
- Each individual have <span style="color: lightgreen">two allele</span> from each parent, with low chance of two persons having the same set of VNTRs (except for identical twins).

The VNTR segments with <span style="color: lightgreen">varying lengths</span> can be extracted with <span style="color: skyblue">restriction enzymes</span>.
- These segments can be separated by <span style="color: violet">gel electrophoresis</span>.
- This method of generating a DNA fingerprint is called <span style="color: skyblue">restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis</span> (RFLP analysis).

##### Gel electrophoresis
**Gel electrophoresis** is a method for separating DNA fragments <span style="color: lightgreen">based on their size</span>.

*Design*:
- DNA is negtively charged. They are placed at the negative end (cathoide) of the gel, they will move towards the positive end (anode).
- Smaller fragments move through the pores of the gel more easily, and move further than larger ones in a given time, separating them according to their size.
- The DNA is stained with a dye or labeled with a radioactive marker as it is colourless.

#### RFLP analysis
*Process*:
1. **DNA extraction**
   DNA can be extracted from samples (e.g. hair, blood, saliva, semen) from different individuals.

2. **Restriction fragment preparation**
   Restriction enzymes are used to cut the DNA at specific sites, producing a large amount of DNA fragments, with some containing the desired VNTRs.

3. **Gel electrophoresis**
   DNA fragments are separated according to their molecular size.

4. **Denaturation of DNA fragments and transfer to a membrane**
   The gel is immersed in an alkaline solution so that DNA fragments are denatured and becomes single-stranded. They are transferred from the gel to a nylon membrane.

5. **Incubation of the membrane with radioactive DNA probes**
   The nylon membrane is incubated with radioactive DNA probes (single-stranded DNA fragments). The DNA probes bind to complementary bases of the VNTRs.

6. **Production of DNA fragments**
   Unbound DNA probes are washed off. An X-ray film is placed against the nylon membrane in the dark. Radioactive probes on the DNA fragments expose the film and give a pattern of dark bands, making up the DNA fingerprint.

*Problems*:
- Time-consuming, require several weeks to complete
- Require relatively large amounts of DNA

> [!info] Alternatives to RFLP analysis
> **Short tandem repeats** (STR) are shorter (in length) repetitive sequences of nucleotides. Specific loci are chosen for analysis, less time is required for analysis.

#### Applications
- **Criminal investigation**
  Hair, saliva, blood or semen sample in the crime scene is collected to create DNA fingerprints for matching with those of victims and suspects.

- **Percentage testing**
  Each child inherits half of the genetic material from each parent, so some bands of the DNA fingerprint of the child will resemble some bands of the mother and father respectively. Individuals can be tested to show whether they are biologically related.

> [!note]
> DNA fingerprints of a pair of identical twins show the same band patterns, so it can be used to determine whether both twins are identical or fraternal.

- **Victim identification**
  DNA fingerprinting can be used to identify the remains of victims in natural disasters, especially when the body is badly decomposed or if only parts of the body is found. DNA samples recovered from personal items are used for comparison.

- **Medical diagnosis of diseases**
  DNA fingerprinting can be used to check whether an individual carries a mutant allele for a genetic disease. These genetic tests are now used to diagnose genetic diseases in fetuses and newborn babies.

- **Authentication of food products and herbal medicines**
  DNA fingerprinting replaces the traditional morphological comparison as a more accurate method of determining the authenticity (genuine vs substitutes) of an uncooked food sample.
  *Examples*: GM foods, caviar, Korean ginseng

- **Ecological studies and conservation**
  Useful when an unknown species is found. Its DNA fingerprint is compared with known species to identify it. Additionally, genetic variations of a particular species can be monitored. Plus, DNA fingerprinting can be used to identify whether goods are made from protected species.

- **Evolutionary studies**
  DNA fingerprinting helps establish evolutionary relationships among different groups of organisms.
