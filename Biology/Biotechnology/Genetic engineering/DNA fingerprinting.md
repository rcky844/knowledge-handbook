**DNA fingerprinting**, also **DNA profiling**, is a technique used for <span class="hi-green">identifying individuals using their DNA profiles</span>.

# Principles
## Variable number tandem repeats
There are **variable number tandem repeats** (VNTRs) in different loci of the <u>non-coding DNA</u> due to the phenomenon of <span class="hi-blue">length polymorphism</span>.
- Each VNTR contains a variable number of short repetitive sequences of nucleotides, which <u>varies greatly among individuals</u>. This results in <span class="hi-green">different lengths of VNTRs</span>.
- Each individual have two allele from each parent, with <span class="hi-green">low chance of two persons having the same set of VNTRs</span> (except for <span class="hi-blue">identical twins</span>).

The VNTR segments with <span class="hi-green">varying lengths</span> can be extracted with <span class="hi-blue">restriction enzymes</span>.
- These segments can be separated by <span class="hi-blue">gel electrophoresis</span>.
- This method of generating a DNA fingerprint is called <span class="hi-blue">restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis</span> (RFLP analysis).

## Gel electrophoresis
**Gel electrophoresis** is a method for separating DNA fragments <span class="hi-green">based on their size</span>.

*Design*:
- <span class="hi-green">Negatively charged DNA</span> are placed at the negative end (cathode) of the gel, they will move towards the positive end (anode).
- <span class="hi-blue">Smaller fragments</span> (with <span class="hi-blue">shorter lengths</span>) move through the pores of the gel more easily, and <span class="hi-green">move further</span> than larger ones in a given time, separating them according to their size.
- The DNA is <span class="hi-green">stained with a dye or labeled with a radioactive marker</span> as it is colourless.

# RFLP analysis
*Process*:
1. **DNA extraction**
   DNA can be extracted from samples (e.g. <u>hair, blood, saliva, semen</u>) from different individuals.

2. **Restriction fragment preparation**
   <span class="hi-blue">Restriction enzymes</span> are used to cut the DNA at specific sites, producing a large amount of DNA fragments, with some containing the desired VNTRs.

3. **Gel electrophoresis**
   DNA fragments are separated according to their molecular size.

4. **Denaturation of DNA fragments and transfer to a membrane**
   The gel is immersed in an alkaline solution so that DNA fragments are denatured and becomes single-stranded. They are transferred from the gel to a nylon membrane.

5. **Incubation of the membrane with radioactive DNA probes**
   The nylon membrane is incubated with <span class="hi-blue">radioactive DNA probes</span> (single-stranded DNA fragments). The DNA probes bind to complementary bases of the VNTRs.

6. **Production of DNA fragments**
   Unbound DNA probes are washed off. An X-ray film is placed against the nylon membrane in the dark. Radioactive probes on the DNA fragments expose the film and give a pattern of dark bands, making up the DNA fingerprint.

*Problems*:
- Time-consuming, require several weeks to complete
- Require relatively large amounts of DNA

> [!info] Alternatives to RFLP analysis
> **Short tandem repeats** (STR) are shorter (in length) repetitive sequences of nucleotides. Specific loci are chosen for analysis, less time is required for analysis.

# Applications
1. **Criminal investigation**
   Hair, saliva, blood or semen sample in the crime scene is collected to create DNA fingerprints for matching with those of victims and suspects.

2. **Percentage testing**
   Each child inherits half of the genetic material from each parent, so some bands of the DNA fingerprint of the child will <span class="hi-green">resemble some bands of the mother and father respectively</span>. Individuals can be tested to show whether they are biologically related.

> [!note]
> DNA fingerprints of a pair of identical twins show the same band patterns, so it can be used to determine whether both twins are identical or fraternal.

3. **Victim identification**
   DNA fingerprinting can be used to identify the remains of victims in natural disasters, especially when the body is badly decomposed or if only parts of the body is found. DNA samples recovered from personal items are used for comparison.

4. **Medical diagnosis of diseases**
   DNA fingerprinting can be used to check whether an individual carries a <span class="hi-blue">mutant allele</span> for a genetic disease. These genetic tests are now used to diagnose genetic diseases in fetuses and newborn babies.

5. **Authentication of food products and herbal medicines**
   DNA fingerprinting replaces the traditional morphological comparison as a more accurate method of determining the authenticity (genuine vs substitutes) of an <span class="hi-blue">uncooked food sample</span>.
   *Examples*: GM foods, caviar, Korean ginseng

6. **Ecological studies and conservation**
   Useful when an unknown species is found. Its DNA fingerprint is compared with known species to identify it. Additionally, genetic variations of a particular species can be monitored. Plus, DNA fingerprinting can be used to identify whether goods are made from protected species.

7. **Evolutionary studies**
   DNA fingerprinting helps establish evolutionary relationships among different groups of organisms.
