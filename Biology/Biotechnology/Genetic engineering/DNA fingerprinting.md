**DNA fingerprinting**, also **DNA profiling**, is a technique used for <u>identifying individuals using their DNA profiles</u>.

#### Principles
##### Variable number tandem repeats
There are **variable number tandem repeats** (VNTRs) in different loci of the non-coding DNA due to the phenomenon of <span style="color: orange">length polymorphism</span>.
- Each VNTR contains a variable number of short repetitive sequences of nucleotides, which varies greatly among individuals. This results in <span style="color: lightgreen">different lengths</span> of VNTRs.
- Each individual have <span style="color: lightgreen">two allele</span> from each parent, with low chance of two persons having the same set of VNTRs (except for identical twins).

The VNTR segments with <span style="color: lightgreen">varying lengths</span> can be extracted with <span style="color: skyblue">restriction enzymes</span>.
- These segments can be separated by <span style="color: violet">gel electrophoresis</span>.
- This method of generating a DNA fingerprint is called <span style="color: skyblue">restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis</span> (RFLP analysis).

##### Gel electrophoresis
**Gel electrophoresis** is a method for separating DNA fragments <span style="color: lightgreen">based on their size</span>.

**Design**:
- DNA is placed at the negative end (cathoide) of the gel. As they are negatively charged, they move towards the positive end (anode).
- Smaller fragments move through the pores of the gel more easily, and move further than larger ones in a given time, separating them according to their size.
- The DNA is stained with a dye or labeled with a radioactive marker as it is colourless.

#### RFLP analysis
**Process**:
1. *DNA extraction*
   DNA can be extracted from samples (e.g. hair, blood, saliva, semen) from different individuals.

2. *Restriction fragment preparation*
   Restriction enzymes are used to cut the DNA at specific sites, producing a large amount of DNA fragments, with some containing the desired VNTRs.

3. *Gel electrophoresis*
   DNA fragments are separated according to their molecular size.

4. *Denaturation of DNA fragments and transfer to a membrane*
   The gel is immersed in an alkaline solution so that DNA fragments are denatured and becomes single-stranded. They are transferred from the gel to a nylon membrane.

5. *Incubation of the membrane with radioactive DNA probes*
   The nylon membrane is incubated with radioactive DNA probes (single-stranded DNA fragments). The DNA probes bind to complementary bases of the VNTRs.

6. *Production of DNA fragments*
   Unbound DNA probes are washed off. An X-ray film is placed against the nylon membrane in the dark. Radioactive probes on the DNA fragments expose the film and give a pattern of dark bands, making up the DNA fingerprint.

**Problems**:
- Time-consuming, require several weeks to complete
- Require relatively large amounts of DNA

> [!info] Alternatives to RFLP analysis
> **Short tandem repeats** (STR) are shorter (in length) repetitive sequences of nucleotides. Specific loci are chosen for analysis, less time is required for analysis.
