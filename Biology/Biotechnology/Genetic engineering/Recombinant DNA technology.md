![[Genetic engineering]]

**Recombinant DNA technology** are techniques for <u>combining DNA molecules</u>. As it involves a host cell, biological systems can be used for <span style="color: lightgreen">synthesizing protein molecules</span>.

> [!tip] Comparison with PCR
> PCR is a technique strictly for <span style="color: lightgreen">replicating specific DNA sequences <u>outside cells</u></span>, <span style="color: orange">proteins are not produced</span>.

**Terminology**:
- *Plasmids*: Small, circular DNA molecules found in bacteria separate from the bacterial chromosome and can replicate independently.
- *Bacteriophages*: Viruses that infect bacteria by attaching to the surface of bacteria and injecting their genetic materials into the bacterial cells.
- *Gene of interest*: Fragment of the required DNA isolated from a donor cell.
- *Vector*: DNA molecule used for transferring into a <span style="color: skyblue">host cell</span>, usually a <span style="color: skyblue">plasmids</span>.
- *Restriction enzymes*: Produced by bacteria as a <span style="color: orange">defense mechanism</span> against <span style="color: skyblue">bacteriophages</span> by <span style="color: lightgreen">cutting up viral DNA before it can be integrated into the bacteria chromosome and replicates</span>.

**Useful characteristics of vectors**:
- Plasmids are naturally transferred between beneficial cells.
- Plasmids replicate independently of the bacteria chromosome.
- Plasmids contain genes (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes) that can serve as a marker for identifying the host cells that contain the inserted gene of interest

#### Process via plasmids

Example with synthesizing human insulin ⤴️

- **Isolation of gene of interest and vectors**
	- DNA fragments containing the <span style="color: violet">gene of interest</span> (gene coding for particular proteins) are isolated from donor cells.
	- <span style="color: violet">Vectors</span> (plasmids) are isolated from bacteria.

- **Restriction**
	- DNA fragments containing <span style="color: lightgreen">gene of interest are cut using restriction enzymes</span>, which act as molecular scissors to cut DNA at specific base sequences.
	- The <span style="color: lightgreen">same restriction enzyme is used to cut open the plasmids</span>.

- **Insertion of gene of interest**
	- *Ligation*: Gene of interest is inserted into an open plasmid, joined together with the help of <span style="color: skyblue">DNA ligase</span>, acting like molecular glue.
	- Resulting DNA molecule is called a <span style="color: skyblue">recombinant plasmid</span>.

#### Process via bacteriophages
//TODO: import pics

- Gene of interest is inserted into the DNA of a bacteriophage.
- The bacteriophage will be injected into the bacterium along with the bacteriophage DNA, and integrates into the bacterial chromosome.
#### Applications
> [!tip]
> An organism that contains genes from another species is called a <u>transgenic organism</u>, or a <u>genetically modified organism (GMO)</u>.

##### Medicine
###### Production of pharmaceutical products
Recombinant DNA technology helps produce proteins molecules useful for patients with diseases.

| Protein | GMO | Usage |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Human insulin | Bacteria | Treating diabetes |
| Human growth hormone (GH) | Bacteria | Treating dwarfism |
| Hepatitis B vaccine | Yeast | Prevention |
| Collagen | Plants | Reconstructive surgery |
| Fibrinogen | Cattle | Treating blood clotting disorder |

###### Gene therapy
*Main article: [[Gene therapy]]*

**Gene therapy** is a way to treat genetic diseases caused by defective genes.

###### Medical research
GMO (e.g. GM mice) can act as models for studying diseases.
