![[Genetic engineering]]

**Recombinant DNA technology** are techniques for <span class="hi-green">cutting</span> and <span class="hi-green">joining</span> DNA fragments from different sources to create recombinant DNA.
- This allows the transfer a <span class="hi-blue">gene of interest</span> (DNA fragment isolated from donor cell) from a donor organism to a host organism.
- As it involves a host cell, biological systems can be used for <span class="hi-green">synthesizing protein molecules</span>.

> [!tip] Comparison with PCR
> PCR is a technique strictly for <span class="hi-green">replicating specific DNA sequences <u>outside cells</u></span>, <u>proteins are not produced</u>.

**Vectors** are DNA molecules used for transferring into a <span class="hi-blue">host cell</span>, commonly bacterial <span class="hi-blue">plasmids</span> and <span class="hi-blue">viruses</span>.

*Characteristics of plasmids*:
- Circular double-stranded DNA that <span class="hi-green">replicate independently</span> of the bacteria chromosome.
- <span class="hi-green">Naturally transferred</span> between bacterial cells.
- Contain genes (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes) that may offer <span class="hi-green">survival advantages</span> to the bacteria.

# Principle
- **Isolation of gene of interest and vectors**
	- DNA fragments containing the <span class="hi-blue">gene of interest</span> (gene coding for particular proteins) are isolated from donor cells.
	- <span class="hi-blue">Vectors</span> (plasmids) are isolated from bacteria.

- **Restriction** (cutting of DNA fragments and plasmids)
	- Restriction enzymes <span class="hi-green">recognize</span> specific base sequences (<span class="hi-blue">restriction sites</span>) on a piece of DNA and <span class="hi-green">cut</span> at specific base sequences.
	- The <span class="hi-green">same restriction enzyme</span> is used to cut open the plasmids.
	- Different types of [[Sticky and blunt ends|ends of a DNA fragment]] are produced.

> [!note]
> Restriction enzymes are produced by bacteria as a <u>defense mechanism</u> against <span class="hi-blue">bacteriophages</span> by <span class="hi-green">cutting up viral DNA</span> before it can be integrated into the bacteria chromosome and replicates.

- **Ligation** (joining of DNA fragments and plasmids)
	- Gene of interest is inserted into an open plasmid, and joined together with the help of <span class="hi-blue">DNA ligase</span>.
	- Resulting DNA molecule is called a <span class="hi-blue">recombinant plasmid</span>.

> [!tip] Host cell
> Bacteria are commonly used as <span class="hi-blue">host cells</span> as plasmids are naturally transferred between these cells.

## Production of human insulin
![[recombinant_tech.webp|420]]

- <span class="hi-blue">Recombinant plasmids</span> are produced by inserting the human insulin gene into plasmids. (➊ ~ ➍)
- Bacteria take up recombinant plasmids and undergo <span class="hi-green">transformation</span>. (➎)
- Transformed bacteria are <span class="hi-green">selected and cultured</span> on a large scale in industrial fermenters (➏)
- Numerous identical copies of gene of interest are produced by <span class="hi-green">gene cloning</span>. (➐)
- The transformed bacteria is induced to synthesize the gene products in <span class="hi-green">gene expression</span>. (➐)

## Selecting transformed bacteria
It is possible for some bacteria to <span class="hi-green">not take up any recombinant plasmids</span>, so they are <span class="hi-green">not transformed</span>.
- In order to <u>select / screen out</u> transformed bacteria, the plasmids used carry a <span class="hi-blue">selection marker</span> (e.g. <span class="hi-blue">antibiotic resistance gene</span>).
- They are grown in a medium containing an antibiotic, only the <span class="hi-green">transformed bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic</span>, so they survive and reproduce to form <span class="hi-blue">colonies</span>.

# Applications
*Medicine*:
1. **Production of pharmaceutical products**
   Produces <span class="hi-green">proteins molecules</span> with [[genetically modified organisms]] useful for patients with diseases.

2. **Gene therapy** ([[Gene therapy|main article]])
   Transfers a normal gene into patient's cells (<span class="hi-blue">target cells</span>) in order to treat genetic diseases.

3. **Medical research**
   [[Genetically modified organisms]] (e.g. GM mice) are produced as models for studying human diseases.

*Agriculture and food production*:
- Produces GM crops and animals with <span class="hi-green">increased productivity, resistance to pests or diseases, and nutritional values</span>.
- Less time-consuming than selective breeding.

*Industrial applications*:
- Produces GM bacteria that can produce [[Enzymes#Advantages of using enzymes in industrial processes|enzymes]] for use in industrial processes.

> [!tip] Advantages
> - <u>Large amounts</u> of enzymes can be made in a <u>relatively short time</u> because of the high growth rate of bacteria.
> - Enzymes with <u>high purity</u> can be made, saving the cost of purifying them.
> - Enzymes can be modified to be <u>more effective</u> at desired temperatures, pH or other conditions in manufacturing processes.

*Bioremediation*:
- Produces GM bacteria to <span class="hi-green">clean up oil spills, heavy metals, and radioactive wastes</span> by converting them into non-toxic compounds.
