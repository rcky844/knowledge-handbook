**Polymerase chain reaction** (PCR) is a technique for replicating specific DNA sequences <span style="color: lightgreen">outside cells</span> to many copies quickly and accurately.

#### Principle
The principle of PCR is similar to [[DNA replication]], but it is performed in a reaction mixture outside cells consisting of:

- **DNA template**
  Sample of target DNA sequence to be <span style="color: aqua">amplified</span>.

- **Primers**
	- Short sequences of synthetic single-stranded DNA that is <span style="color: lightgreen">complementary to one end of the target sequence</span>, marking the point where the synthesis of a new DNA strand (which needs two different primers) starts.
	- The target sequence to be amplified is <span style="color: violet">'bracketed'</span>.

- **Heat-stable DNA polymerase**
	- An enzyme that synthesizes new DNA strands by joining adjacent nucleotides.
	- The *Taq* DNA polymerase is commonly used as it can withstand high temperature required during PCR.

- **Nucleotides**
  Building blocks of new DNA strands.

1. **Denaturation**
   Heat the reaction mixture (to about 95째C) to cause <span style="color: lightgreen">DNA double helix to unwind and separate into two single strands</span>.

2. **Primer annealing**
   Cool the reaction mixture (to between 50째C and 65째C) to <span style="color: lightgreen">allow primers to anneal to the single-stranded DNA</span> by <span style="color: violet">complementary base pairing</span> to each end of the DNA strands.

3. **Extension**
   <span style="color: lightgreen">Raise the temperature</span> (to about 70째C) for <span style="color: aqua">DNA polymerase</span> to <span style="color: orange">catalyse the synthesis of new DNA strands</span>.
