![[Genetic engineering]]

**Genetically modified organisms** (GMOs) are organisms whose <span style="color:  lightgreen">genetic composition have been changed</span> using genetic engineering techniques.

#### Genetically modified microorganisms
**Methods**:
- [[Recombinant DNA technology]]
  A gene of interest is introduced to a bacterium by using plasmids or bacteriophages.

#### Genetically modified plants
A gene of interest is transferred into plants by utilizing the soil bacterium *Agrobacterium*.
- The bacterium contains a plasmid called $T_i$ (tumour inducing) plasmid, which can carry the gene of interest into a plant cell to integrate it with the plant DNA.
- The bacterium can infect most dicotyledonous plants, so it is widely used in modifying these plants.

A <span style="color: skyblue">gene gun</span> can be used to transfer target genes into plant cells. DNA fragments containing the gene of interest are coated onto the surface of gold or tungsten nano-sized beads. The beads are then physically forced into the plant cells by the gene gun. 
- *Advantage*: Not limited by the host, can be used with any plants

#### Genetically modified animals
**Microinjection** can be used to create genetically modified animals where all of their cells contain the gene of interest. The gene is introduced into the zygote, the very first cell of the animal.
