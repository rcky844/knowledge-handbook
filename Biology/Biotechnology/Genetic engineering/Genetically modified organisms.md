![[Genetic engineering]]

**Genetically modified organisms** (GMOs) are organisms whose <span class="hi-green">genetic composition have been changed</span> using genetic engineering techniques.

# Genetically modified microorganisms
*Method*: [[Recombinant DNA technology]]
A gene of interest is introduced to a bacterium by using <span class="hi-blue">plasmids or bacteriophages</span>.

| Protein | GMO | Usage |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Human insulin | Bacteria | Treating diabetes |
| Human growth hormone (GH) | Bacteria | Treating dwarfism |
| Hepatitis B vaccine | Yeast | Prevention |
| Collagen | Plants | Reconstructive surgery |
| Fibrinogen | Cattle | Treating blood clotting disorder |

# Genetically modified plants
## Agrobacterium
Soil bacterium *Agrobacterium* can be utilized to transfer a gene of interest (e.g. herbicide resistant gene) into plants.
- The bacterium contains $T_i$ (<span class="hi-blue">tumour inducing</span>) plasmid, which can carry the gene of interest into a plant cell to integrate it with the plant DNA.
- The bacterium can infect most <span class="hi-blue">dicotyledonous plants</span>, so it is widely used in modifying these plants.

*Limitations*:
- Insertion is a <span class="hi-green">random process</span>, it may <u>affect expression</u> of the gene in host cells.
- The <span class="hi-green">target gene may not be expressed</span> in infected plant cells.
- Only a <span class="hi-green">small proportion of host cells</span> can be infected.
- <span class="hi-green">Not all plants can be infected</span> by the bacterium.

> [!warning]
> Plants do not have an adaptive immune system like animals, so the bacterium will not induce immune responses.

## Gene gun
A <span class="hi-blue">gene gun</span> can be used to transfer target genes into plant cells.
- DNA fragments containing the gene of interest are coated onto the surface of gold or tungsten nano-sized beads, which are then physically forced into the plant cells (shooting out).

*Advantage*:
- Can deliver the gene to any cells without limitation.

*Disadvantage*:
- Unable to confirm whether insertion is successful.
- The gene may not be expressed.
- The process can cause mechanical damage to the cell.

# Genetically modified animals
## Microinjection
**Microinjection** can be used to create genetically modified animals where all of their cells contain the gene of interest.
- The gene is introduced into the zygote, the very first cell of the animal.

*Process*:
1. Egg cells from the animal are fertilized by sperms *in virto*.
2. Foreign DNA containing gene of interest is injected into <span class="hi-green">fertilized eggs</span> using a very fine needle-like pipette viewed with a microscope.
3. Fertilized eggs are allowed to <span class="hi-green">grow and develop into embryos</span>.
4. The embryos are implanted into the uterus of another female animal (<span class="hi-blue">surrogate mother</span>).
5. The surrogate mother gives birth to offspring containing the gene of interest.

*Advantage*:
- Precise delivery of gene to the target cell.

*Disadvantage*:
- Injection can cause damage to cells.
- Only one cell is targeted per injection.

## Viruses or liposomes
**Viruses or liposomes** can be used as vectors for transferring target genes into animal cells.

*Details*:
- Genome of the **virus** is modified to remove disease-causing genes to insert the gene of interest.
- **Liposomes** are small artificially prepared vesicles made of a lipid bilayer with the gene to be delivered enclosed in vesicles, which then fuses with the cell membrane to deliver the gene into the cell.

*Advantage*:
- Ensure delivery of gene to specific host cell (antigens)

*Disadvantage*:
- May induce immune response
