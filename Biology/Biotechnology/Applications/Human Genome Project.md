**Human Genome Project** was an international scientific research project started in 1990 by the US government to sequence the entire human genome.
- A genome is the entire DNA in the somatic cells of an organism, including all of its genes.

*Goals of HGP*:
- Determine the base sequence of human DNA (DNA sequencing).
- Identify and locate all of the human genes (gene mapping).
- Store this information in databases.
- Improve tools for data analysis.
- Transfer related technologies to the private sector.
- Address the ethical, legal, and social issues that may arise.

# Potential benefits
## Genetic studies and risk assessment
- Scientists can find out the functions of specific genes and how mutations occur.
- Scientists can assess health damage and risks caused by exposure to mutagens and toxic agents.
- Scientists have gained insights into the role of the non-coding regions of the genome.

## Medical diagnosis and disease treatment
- Scientists can identify and locate the genes related to genetic diseases, and develop new diagnostic tests and treatments.

## Evolutionary studies
*Main article: [[Evolution]]*

- Evolutionary relationships between humans and other organisms can be established by comparing the genomes.
