**Stem cell therapy** involves the use of transplantation of selected and cultured stem cells into patients to replace existing abnormal cells.

Stem cells could be obtained from the <span class="hi-green">bone marrow, blood or cord blood</span> (blood that remains in the placenta and umbilical cord after childbirth).

- Replacing damaged skin (e.g. skin burns)
- Treating broken nose with grown cartilage
- Growing organs for transplants
- Treating spinal cord injury by replacing or regenerating damaged nerve cells in spinal cords
- Replacing insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a diabetic (type I)
- Treating brain damage, Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease with stem cells induced to form brain cells
