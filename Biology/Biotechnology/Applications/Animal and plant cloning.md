**Cloning of organisms** is the production of <span class="hi-green">genetically identical individuals</span>.

# Plant cloning
**Tissue culture**, or **micropropagation**, is a technique commonly used for plant cloning.

*Process*:
1. <span class="hi-blue">Tissue samples</span> are taken from a surface <span class="hi-green">sterilized</span> parent plant.
2. The sample is placed in a <span class="hi-blue">sterilized culture medium</span> to allow the formation of <span class="hi-blue">callus</span> by [[mitotic cell division]].
3. Small pieces of the callus are <span class="hi-green">transferred to different sterile culture media</span> to promote growth of shoots and roots.
4. The <span class="hi-blue">plantlets</span> formed are planted into soil, which grows into a whole plant <span class="hi-green">genetically identical</span> to the parent plant.

# Animal cloning
## Embryo spliting
**Embryo spliting** involves the isolation of individual cells from an embryo at an early stage and growing them independently.
- Each isolated cells develops into an embryo.
- The embryos are then transferred into the uteri of <span class="hi-blue">surrogate mothers</span> for development.

## Somatic cell nuclear transfer
*Process*:
1. A <span class="hi-blue">somatic cell</span> (e.g. mammary gland cell) is obtained from an animal (<span class="hi-blue">nucleus donor</span>).
2. An <span class="hi-blue">egg cell</span> is obtained from another sheep (<span class="hi-blue">egg donor</span>), and its <span class="hi-green">nucleus is removed</span>.
3. The somatic cell is <span class="hi-green">fused with the egg cell</span> (lacks a nucleus). The fused cell develops into an embryo.
4. The embryos are then transferred into the uteri of <span class="hi-blue">surrogate mother</span>.
5. The surrogate mother gives birth to the cloned animal.

# Applications
## Cloning in general
- <span class="hi-green">Desirable characteristics</span> of the parent can be preserved, as clones are genetically identical to the parent.
- Cloning <span class="hi-green">reproduces difficult or slow to breed organisms quickly</span>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Endangered species</span> and organisms with considerable economic importance can be <span class="hi-green">propagated quickly</span>.
- GM plants or animals can be used to <span class="hi-green">produce pharmaceutical products</span> or other useful chemicals.

## Plant cloning
- Cloned plants <span class="hi-green">free of pathogens</span> can be produced, as they are grown under sterile conditions.
- Plant cloning requires <span class="hi-green">relatively little space</span> compared to growing plants in the field.

## Animal cloning
- Cloned animals can serve as <span class="hi-blue">models</span> for <span class="hi-green">studying diseases and testing drugs</span>.
- Cloning <span class="hi-blue">early embryos</span> <span class="hi-green">provide stem cells</span> for research or medical treatment.

# Limitations
## Plant cloning
- The <span class="hi-green">cost of tissue culture may be higher than conventional methods</span> as it requires sterile conditions and is labour-intensive.
- Cloned population may be <span class="hi-green">less able to adapt to environmental changes</span> due to lack of genetic variations.

## Animal cloning
- Animal cloning with nuclear transfer has <span class="hi-green">low success rate</span>, but <span class="hi-green">high costs</span>.
- Animal clones may <span class="hi-green">age faster</span> and have a <span class="hi-green">shorter lifespan</span>.
