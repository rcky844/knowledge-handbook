**Transgenic organisms** are [[genetically modified organisms]] used in scientific research, agriculture and the food industry.

# Usage in scientific research
1. **Studying the functions of genes**
   Genes can be introduced or inactivated for comparing the characteristics or metabolism of transgenic and non-transgenic organisms.

2. **Studying diseases**
   Transgenic organisms can be used as models to study mechanisms of diseases and test possible treatments.
   *Example*: Oncogenes can be introduced into genomes of mice to develop cancer.

3. **Safety testing**
   Transgenic organisms are made more sensitive to certain chemicals and exposed to new products (e.g. cosmetics) to evaluate the safety of the products by examining their physiological responses.

# Usage in agriculture & food industry
Transgenic crops are genetically modified to <span class="hi-green">improve yield, shelf life and nutritional value</span>, so as to provide <span class="hi-green">more affordable</span> food to more people.

## Traits reducing crop loss
1. **Herbicide resistance**
   Farmers can use herbicide to kill weeds competing with crops (water, nutrients, sunlight, space), while not killing the crops themselves.

2. **Pest resistance**
   Crops are engineered to synthesize <span class="hi-blue">Bt toxins</span> (a toxic protein that kills the larvae of certain insects) in all cells to reduce the amount of chemical pesticides required.

3. **Disease resistance**
   *Example*: Tobacco mosaic virus; causes pale mottling on leaves of infected plants

4. **Cold, drought and salt tolerance**
   Crops can be grown in places with relatively cool climates, or poor soil quality (e.g. high salt concentration or waterlogging).

## Traits improving quality of crops
1. **Enhanced nutritional value**
   *Example*: Omega-3 fatty acids; helps prevent cardiovascular diseases
   *Example*: Beta-carotene (Golden Rice); precursor of [[Vitamins#Vitamin A|vitamin A]]

2. **Longer shelf life**
   Their ripening is controlled, which reduces the loss of fruits and food wastage caused by early ripening and softening before reaching consumers. They can be stored for a longer time under controlled conditions and transported to more distant markets.

# Usage in agriculture and food industry
## Traits increasing productivity
1. **Faster growth**
   *Example*: Transgenic salmon
	- Increased productivity - Grows twice as fast as non-transgenic ones
	- Lowers unit costs
	- Reduces overfishing of wild salmon

2. **Tolerance to cold climate**
   Warm water species are genetically engineered to produce antifreeze proteins, which keep them active even in freezing environments, so they can be farmed in cold waters.

3. **Disease resistance**
   Diary cows have a gene coding for an antibacterial protein inserted to kill the bacteria that cause mastitis (decreases volume and quality of milk produced).

## Traits improving nutritional value of food products
- Transgenic cows are genetically modified to produce milk that contains some <span class="hi-blue">proteins found in human breast milk</span>, providing a better alternative for mothers who cannot breastfeed their babies.
- Some transgenic cows are genetically produced milk with <span class="hi-blue">higher level of casein</span>, which <span class="hi-green">shortens the time required for coagulation of curds in cheese making</span>.
- Transgenic cows and pigs have been developed with a gene that increases the content of <span class="hi-blue">omega-3 fatty acids</span>.

## Traits reducing environmental impact of rearing animals
Transgenic pigs are made to be able to <span class="hi-green">digest and absorb phosphate more efficiently</span> to significantly <u>reduce the phosphate content</u> in their <span class="hi-blue">manure</span>.
- If it is washed into a river, it would not contaminate the water and cause excessive growth of algae (<span class="hi-blue">algal bloom</span>).
