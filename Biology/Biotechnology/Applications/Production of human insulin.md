- <span class="hi-blue">Recombinant plasmids</span> are produced by inserting the human insulin gene into plasmids. (➊ ~ ➍)
- Bacteria take up recombinant plasmids and undergo <span class="hi-green">transformation</span>. (➎)
- Transformed bacteria are <span class="hi-green">selected and cultured</span> on a large scale in industrial fermenters (➏)
- Numerous identical copies of gene of interest are produced by <span class="hi-green">gene cloning</span>. (➐)
- The transformed bacteria is induced to synthesize the gene products in <span class="hi-green">gene expression</span>. (➐)
