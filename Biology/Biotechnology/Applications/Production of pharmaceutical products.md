*Benefits of production with GMOs*:
- **Higher product yield**
  GMOs typically have a <span class="hi-green">higher growth rate</span>, product yield from GMOs is much higher than animal sources, which takes a long time to rear.

- **More pure & lower risk of infection**
  The <span class="hi-green">process of purification is much easier</span> from GMOs than animal sources, whereas products extracted from animal sources are easily contaminated by pathogens.

- **Continuous production**
  Production <span class="hi-green">occurs continuously</span> from bacterial culture, whereas animals provide only a limited amount of products.

- **Less side effects**
  Products with <span class="hi-green">amino acid sequences highly similar</span> to human counterparts can be produced, so it <u>would not be rejected</u> by the body as <span class="hi-orange">immune responses</span> would not be triggered that degrade its functions.

â†ª *Overall effect*: Lower cost of production

# Examples
## Human insulin
> *Refer to [[Recombinant DNA technology#Production of human insulin|this section]] for production process.*

*Background*:
- Diabetic (type I) patients were treated with <span class="hi-green">insulin extracted</span> from animals (e.g. pigs, cattle).

*Problems*:
- Easily <span class="hi-green">contaminated</span> by pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses)
- Has an <span class="hi-green">amino acid sequence slightly different</span> from human insulin, may <span class="hi-green">trigger immune response</span> and cause side effects.

*Solution*: <span class="hi-blue">Recombinant human insulin</span>
- Produced by genetically modified bacteria.
- Has the same amino acid sequences as natural human insulin.
- Does not trigger immune responses in the human body and has fewer side effects.

## Human growth hormone
*Background*:
- Caused by <span class="hi-blue">pituitary gland disorders</span>, people affected has slow growth rate, with shorter height than other individuals.
- Treated by injections of growth hormone extracted from dead bodies.

*Problems*:
- Supply for extracted HGH is <span class="hi-green">limited</span>.
- Extracts might have been contaminated with pathogens.

*Solution*: <span class="hi-blue">Recombinant HGH</span>
- Produced by genetically modified bacteria.
- Produced in larger quantities and in a purer form.

## Vaccines
*Pre-context: [[Vaccination]]*

*Problems*:
- Vaccines for viruses may become pathogenic again.

*Solution \#1*: <span class="hi-blue">Recombinant protein vaccines</span>
- Produced by GM microorganisms.
- Free of whole pathogens and safer.
- Can be produced in large quantities.

*Solution \#2*: <span class="hi-blue">Transgenic plants</span>
- Antigens are produced in the edible parts of the plants, which will be absorbed into the blood through the alimentary canal.
- Antigens will stimulate the body to produce a [[Primary and secondary response#Primary response|primary response]] to produce memory cells.

## Monoclonal antibodies
**Monoclonal antibodies** are produced by isolated and cloned [[Lymphocytes#B cells|B cells]]. They are highly specific, sensitive and effective.

### Isolation and purification of biomolecules
![[isolation_biomolecules.webp|600]]

- The desired protein molecules will <span class="hi-green">bind to the antibodies on the beads</span>, while other molecules will flow through.

### Pregnancy testing
- A pregnancy test strip contains <span class="hi-blue">monoclonal antibodies specific for HCG</span>.
- When the test strip is dipped into a <span class="hi-green">urine sample</span> of a pregnant women, the HCG present binds to the monoclonal antibodies, resulting in a colour change of the strip that indicates pregnancy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of diseases
- **Rapid antigen test**: Monoclonal antibodies can recognize and specifically bind to antigens on pathogens or cancer cells for diagnostic tests.
- **Treatment of cancer**: Monoclonal antibodies recognize and attach to cancer cells, <span class="hi-blue">'making'</span> them for the immune system to destroy them.

# Role of bacteria
## Providers of plasmids as vectors
Plasmids extracted from bacteria are usually <span class="hi-green">used as vectors for transferring a gene of interest</span> into host cells.

*Advantages*:
- Plasmids are **small in size**. They are <span class="hi-green">readily taken up</span> by bacteria cells and <span class="hi-green">transferred naturally</span> between bacteria.
- Plasmids can **serve as marker** to allow the selection of transformed bacteria, as they usually <span class="hi-green">carry antibiotic resistance genes</span>.
- Plasmids **replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome**, and <span class="hi-green">multiple copies</span> of the gene of interest can exist in a single bacterial cell.

## As host cells
Bacteria are commonly used as <span class="hi-blue">host cells</span> in [[Recombinant DNA technology]].

*Advantages*:
- **Bacteria are easy to manipulate.**
	- They are well studied and can easily be genetically modified.
	- They are easier to transfer target genes to bacteria.

- **Bacteria have a high growth rate.**
	- Bacteria have high reproduction rate, and many have a <span class="hi-green">short generation time</span>.
	- Large quantities of products can be produced within a short period of time.

- **Bacteria are easy to culture.**
	- They can be <span class="hi-green">grown in a small space</span> under ideal conditions.
	- They can produce desirable products continuously by adding culture medium and removing waste products from a fermenter.

- **It is easy to extract and purify products.**
	- Products often contain fewer impurities than products from other sources.
	- The <span class="hi-green">cost</span> of purification of products from a bacterial culture is <span class="hi-green">lower</span> than from animal sources.
