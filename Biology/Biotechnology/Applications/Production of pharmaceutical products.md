*Benefits of production via modern biotechnology*:
- <span style="color: violet">More pure</span> - Will not be contaminated by pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses)
- <span style="color: violet">Much larger quantities</span> - Can solve the inadequate supply problem of extracting from natural sources
- <span style="color: violet">Less side effects</span> - Amino acid sequences are highly similar from the human counterpart, and would not trigger immune responses with great side effects
- <span style="color: violet">More affordable</span> - 

#### Examples
##### Human insulin
**Background**:
- Diabetic (type I) patients were treated with insulin extracted from animals (e.g. pigs, cattle).

**Problems**:
- Easily contaminated by pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses)
- Has an amino acid sequence slightly different from human insulin, may trigger immune response and cause side effects.

**Solution**: <span style="color: skyblue">Recombinant human insulin</span>
- Produced by genetically modified bacteria.
- Has the same amino acid sequences as natural human insulin.
- Does not trigger immune responses in the human body and has fewer side effects.

##### Human growth hormone
**Background**:
- Caused by pituitary gland disorders, people affected has slow growth rate, with shorter height than other individuals.
- Treated by injections of growth hormone extracted from dead bodies.

**Problems**:
- Supply for extracted HGH is limited.
- Extracts might have been contaminated with pathogens.

**Solution**: <span style="color: skyblue">Recombinant HGH</span>
- Produced by genetically modified bacteria.
- Produced in larger quantities and in a purer form.

##### Vaccines
*Pre-context: [[Vaccination]]*

**Problems**:
- <!-- Virus vaccine may become pathogenic again -->

**Solution \#1**: <span style="color: skyblue">Recombinant protein vaccines</span>
- Produced by GM microorganisms.
- Free of whole pathogens.
- Can be produced in large quantities.

**Solution \#2**: <!--TODO-->

##### Monoclonal antibiotics

#### Role of bacteria
##### Providers of plasmids as vectors
Plasmids extracted from bacteria are usually <span style="color: lightgreen">used as vectors for transferring a gene of interest into host cells</span>.

**Advantages**:
- *Plasmids are small in size.* They are readily taken up by bacteria cells and transferred naturally between bacteria.
- *Plasmids can serve as marker* to allow the selection of transformed bacteria, as they usually carry antibiotic resistance genes.
- *Plasmids replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome*, and multiple copies of the gene of interest can exist in a single bacterial cell.

##### As host cells
Bacteria are commonly used as <span style="color: violet">host cells</span> in [[recombinant DNA technology]].

**Advantages**:
- *Bacteria are easy too manipulate.*
	- They are well studied and can easily be genetically modified.
	- They are easier to transfer target genes to bacteria.

- *Bacteria have a high growth rate.*
	- Bacteria have high reproduction rate, and many have a short generation time.
	- Large quantities of products can be produced within a short period of time.

- *Bacteria are easy to culture.*
	- They can be grown in a small space under ideal conditions.
	- They can produce desirable products continuously by adding culture medium and removing waste products from a fermenter.

- *It is easy to extract and purify products.*
	- Products often contain fewer impurities than products from other sources, the cost of purification of products from a bacterial culture is lower.
