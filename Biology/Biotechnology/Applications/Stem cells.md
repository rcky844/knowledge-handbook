**Stem cells** are unspecialized cells. They can divide numerous times by [[mitotic cell division]] to form new stem cells or differentiate into various types of cells in the body.

# Types of stem cells
## Embryonic stem cells
**Embryonic stem cells** are obtained from the inner cell mass of a four to five days old embryo (before implantation in uterus) called <span class="hi-blue">blastocyst</span>.

These cells have the potential to differentiate into any cell types of the body, and are described as <span class="hi-green">pluripotent</span> stem cells.

## Adult stem cells
**Adult stem cells** are undifferentiated cells found in various tissues, such as the <span style="color: aqua">bone marrow, blood and skin</span>.
↪️ *Tissue-specific* - Produce new cells to replace the dead or damaged cells in the tissues they are found.

These cells can only develop into a limited number of cell types, and are described as <span class="hi-green">multipotent</span> stem cells.
