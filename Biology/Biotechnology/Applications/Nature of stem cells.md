**Stem cells** are unspecialized cells. They can divide numerous times by [[mitotic cell division]] to form new stem cells or <span class="hi-green">differentiate</span> into various types of cells in the body.

# Types of stem cells
## Embryonic stem cells
**Embryonic stem cells** are obtained from the inner cell mass of a <span class="hi-green">four to five days old embryo</span> (before implantation in uterus) called <span class="hi-blue">blastocyst</span>.

These cells have the potential to differentiate into any cell types of the body, and are described as <span class="hi-blue">pluripotent</span> stem cells.

They are mainly obtained from <span class="hi-blue">left over embryos after IVF</span>.

## Adult stem cells
**Adult stem cells** are undifferentiated cells found in various tissues, such as the <u>bone marrow, blood and skin</u>.
↪️ *Tissue-specific* - Produce new cells to replace the dead or damaged cells in the tissues they are found.

These cells can only develop into a limited number of cell types, and are described as <span class="hi-blue">multipotent</span> stem cells. They see limited usage.

They are isolated from various <span class="hi-blue">tissues in the bodies of adults and children</span>.

# Applications
Isolated stem cells can be grown in culture media and stimulated to differentiate and develop into different types of cells.

1. **Research on cell development**
   Helps understanding on differentiation of cells into the wide range of specialized cells in order to find ways to cure or prevent some birth defects and cancers.

2. **Drug testing**
   Helps reduce animal testing and controversies on its ethical issues.

3. **Stem cell therapy**

## Limitations
1. **Ethical issues** ([[Bioethics]])
   Human embryos are destroyed when isolating embryonic stem cells.

2. **Safety concerns**
	- Cells in organ or tissue transplants can be recognized as foreign by recipient's immune system and <span class="hi-blue">rejected</span>.
	- Transplanted stem cells may <span class="hi-green">proliferate uncontrollably and becomes cancerous</span>, or <span class="hi-green">differentiate into undesired cells</span> in the patient.

3. **Difficulty of usage**
	- Body tissues contain only a <span class="hi-green">small number of adult stem cells</span>, and they are <span class="hi-green">difficult to isolate and culture</span>.
	- Stem cells are difficult to grow and induce differentiation.

> [!tip] Advantages of using adult stem cells
> - Adult stem cells are derived from the patient itself, and does not harm the patient.
> - Transplanted will not be rejected by the patient's own immune system.
