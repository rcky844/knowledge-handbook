**Gene therapy** can be used to <span style="color: lightgreen">introduce genetic materials into cells to treat genetic diseases involving defective gene</span>.
- It involves the use of vectors such as inactivated viruses, which infects and transfers the normal gene into the target cell.
- The normal gene is expressed and directs protein synthesis to produce the functional proteins.

> [!note] Somatic cell gene therapy
> **Somatic cell gene therapy** changes the genetic material of somatic cells. However, the <span style="color: aqua">genetic material of their germ cells (gametes) is not changed</span>, defective genes is <u>passed on to their offspring</u>.
