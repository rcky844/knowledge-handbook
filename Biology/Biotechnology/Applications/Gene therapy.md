**Gene therapy** can be used to introduce genetic materials into cells to <span class="hi-green">treat genetic diseases involving defective gene</span>.
- It involves the use of <span class="hi-blue">vectors</span> such as <span class="hi-green">inactivated viruses</span>, which infects and transfers the normal gene into the target cell.
- The normal gene is expressed and directs protein synthesis to produce the functional proteins.

> [!note]
> This section focuses mainly on **somatic cell gene therapy**, where the <span class="hi-green">genetic material of their germ cells (gametes) is not changed</span>.

# Selection of target cells
*Criteria*:
- [[Stem cells]] should be selected, as they are capable of producing cells continuously.
- Only cells that can express the correct version of the gene to produce the correct products are selected.

# Benefits & Hazards
*Benefits*:
- Various genetic diseases can be treated.
- Progressive diseases can be prevented.
- Transformation can occur outside of patient's body, no immune response is triggered.
- Only successfully transformed cells are returned to the patient's body, the results are highly effective.
- Gene used comes from humans only, and does not break the normal species barrier nature has set.
- The trait is not heritable and will not change the genetic composition permanently.
- Does not upset the ecological balance (unlike [[Uses of transgenic animals and plants|transgenic animals]]).

*Hazards*:
- It is possible to develop viral diseases, even if viral vectors are made harmless.
- Viral vectors may trigger severe immune responses in some patients.
- New genes may be wrongly delivered to non-target cells, or inappropriately expressed (e.g. making products in excessive amounts or at wrong times).
- New genes are inserted at random locations in the genome and may affect the expression of an existing gene.
- The transformed cells may die, and the body can no longer synthesize the gene products, allowing the disease to reappear.
