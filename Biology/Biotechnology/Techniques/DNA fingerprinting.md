**DNA fingerprinting**, also **DNA profiling**, is a technique used for <span class="hi-green">identifying individuals using their DNA profiles</span>.

# Principles
## Variable number tandem repeats
**Variable number tandem repeats** (VNTRs) are located at <span class="hi-blue">non-coding regions of chromosomes</span> with has large amounts of mutations.

The phenomenon of <span class="hi-orange">length polymorphism</span> can be exploited as:
- Each VNTR contains a <span class="hi-green">variable number of short repetitive sequences of nucleotides</span>, which <u>varies greatly among individuals</u>. This results in <span class="hi-green">different lengths of VNTRs</span> when cut with restriction enzymes.
- Each individual receive two allele from each parent, with <span class="hi-green">low chance of two persons having the same set of VNTRs</span> (except for <span class="hi-blue">identical twins</span>) due to [[independent assortment]], [[crossing over]] or random fertilization.

> [!note]
> The VNTR segments with <span class="hi-green">varying lengths</span> can be extracted with <span class="hi-blue">restriction enzymes</span>.
> - These segments can be separated by <span class="hi-blue">gel electrophoresis</span>.
> - The method of generating a DNA fingerprint is called <span class="hi-blue">restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis</span> (RFLP analysis).

## Gel electrophoresis
**Gel electrophoresis** is a method for separating DNA fragments <span class="hi-green">based on their size</span>.

![[gel_electrophoresis.webp|400]]

*Design*:
- <span class="hi-green">Negatively charged DNA</span> are placed at the <u>negative end</u> (cathode) of the gel, they will <span class="hi-orange">migrate towards the positive end</span> (anode).
- <span class="hi-blue">Smaller fragments</span> (with <span class="hi-blue">shorter lengths</span>) move (through the pores of the gel) <span class="hi-green">faster and further</span> than larger ones in a given time.
  Separate <span class="hi-blue">bands</span> are formed on the gel.
- The DNA is <span class="hi-green">stained with a dye or labeled with a radioactive marker</span> as it is colourless.

# RFLP analysis
**RFLP** (Restriction fragment length polymorphism) is a technique that can pinpoint the locations of genes.

*Process*:
1. <span class="hi-green">Extract</span> DNA sample (e.g. <u>hair, blood, saliva, semen</u>) from the individuals.

> [!tip] Suitability of samples
> - The sample needs to contain <span class="hi-orange">nucleated cells</span> (e.g. hair follicle stem cells, white blood cells, cheek cells).
> - For semen, although one sperm cell only contains one set of chromosomes, there are <span class="hi-green">many sperm cells in semen</span>, each receiving chromosomes randomly in [[Meiotic cell division|meiosis]] from diploid daughter cells. When lyzed, its <span class="hi-blue">lysate</span> would <span class="hi-green">contain both sets of chromosomes</span> in diploid daughter cells.
 
2. Use <span class="hi-blue">restriction enzymes</span> to cut (digest) the DNA sample into segments.
	- A large amount of DNA fragments is produced, some containing VNTRs.

3. <span class="hi-green">Separate</span> DNA fragments using <span class="hi-blue">gel electrophoresis</span>.
	- The DNA fragments are separated according to their <u>molecular size</u>.

4. The gel is immersed in an alkaline solution so that DNA fragments are denatured and becomes single-stranded. They are <span class="hi-green">transferred</span> from the gel to a <span class="hi-blue">nylon membrane</span>.

5. The nylon membrane is <span class="hi-green">incubated</span> with <span class="hi-blue">radioactive DNA probes</span> (single-stranded DNA fragments). The DNA probes bind to complementary bases of the VNTRs.

6. Unbound DNA probes are washed off. An <span class="hi-blue">X-ray film</span> is placed against the nylon membrane in the dark. Radioactive probes on the DNA fragments expose the film and give a pattern of dark bands, making up the DNA fingerprint.

7. <span class="hi-green">Match</span> the DNA fingerprint patterns between individuals.
	- Positive matching can be used as evidence against the suspect / proof for biological relationships as the DNA of an individual is unique.

> [!warning]
> When a sample involves <u>two alleles</u>, the total number of bands formed may need to be multiplied by two.

*Shortcomings*:
- Time-consuming, require several weeks to complete
- Require relatively large amounts of DNA

> [!info] Alternatives to RFLP analysis
> **Short tandem repeats** (STR) are shorter (in length) repetitive sequences of nucleotides. Specific loci are chosen for analysis, less time is required for analysis.

# Applications
1. **Criminal investigation**
   <span class="hi-blue">Hair, saliva, blood or semen</span> sample in the crime scene is collected to create DNA fingerprints for <span class="hi-green">matching</span> with those of victims and suspects.

2. **Percentage testing**
   Each child <u>inherits half</u> of the genetic material from each parent, so some bands of the DNA fingerprint of the child will <span class="hi-green">resemble some bands of the mother and father respectively</span>. Individuals can be tested for any biological relationship.

> [!note]
> DNA fingerprints of a pair of identical twins show the same band patterns, so it can be used to determine whether both twins are identical or fraternal.

3. **Victim identification**
   DNA fingerprinting can be used to identify the <span class="hi-green">remains of victims</span> in natural disasters, especially when the body is badly decomposed or if only parts of the body is found. DNA samples recovered from personal items are used for comparison.

4. **Medical diagnosis of diseases**
   DNA fingerprinting can be used to check whether an individual carries a <span class="hi-blue">mutant allele</span> for a genetic disease in order to diagnose <span class="hi-green">genetic diseases</span> in fetuses and newborn babies.

5. **Authentication of food products and herbal medicines**
   DNA fingerprinting is <span class="hi-green">more accurate</span> method of determining the authenticity (genuine vs substitutes) of an <span class="hi-blue">uncooked food sample</span>, and replaces the traditional morphological comparison.
   *Examples*: GM foods, caviar, Korean ginseng

6. **Ecological studies and conservation**
	- DNA fingerprint of an <span class="hi-green">unknown species</span> is compared with known species to identify it.
	- <span class="hi-green">Genetic variations</span> of a particular species can be monitored.
	- Goods can be identified to check whether they are made from body parts of <span class="hi-orange">protected species</span>.

7. **Evolutionary studies**
   DNA fingerprinting helps establish <span class="hi-blue">evolutionary relationships</span> among different groups of organisms.
