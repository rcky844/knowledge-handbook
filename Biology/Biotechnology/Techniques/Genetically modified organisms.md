**Genetically modified organisms** (GMOs) are organisms whose <span class="hi-green">genetic composition have been changed</span> using genetic engineering techniques.

# Genetically modified microorganisms
*Method*: [[Recombinant DNA technology]]

A gene of interest is introduced to a bacterium by using <span class="hi-blue">plasmids or bacteriophages</span>.

# Genetically modified plants
## Agrobacterium
Soil bacterium *Agrobacterium* can be utilized to transfer a target gene into plant cells (most <span class="hi-blue">dicotyledonous plants</span>) to integrate it with the plant genome, as the bacterium contains $T_i$ (<span class="hi-blue">tumour inducing</span>) plasmid.

*Limitations*:
- Insertion is a <span class="hi-green">random process</span>, it may <u>affect expression</u> of the gene in host cells.
- The <span class="hi-green">target gene may not be expressed</span> in infected plant cells.
- Only a <span class="hi-green">small proportion of host cells</span> can be infected.
- <span class="hi-green">Not all plants can be infected</span> by the bacterium.

> [!info]
> Plants do not have an adaptive immune system like animals, so the bacterium will not induce immune responses.

## Gene gun
A <span class="hi-blue">gene gun</span> can be used to transfer target genes into plant cells. 

*Process*:
- DNA fragments containing the gene of interest are coated onto the surface of gold or tungsten nano-sized beads.
- It is then physically forced into the plant cells <span class="hi-green">(shooting out)</span>.

*Advantage*:
- Can deliver the gene to any cells without limitation.

*Limitations*:
- The gene may not be expressed.
- The process can cause mechanical damage to the cell.

# Genetically modified animals
## Microinjection
**Microinjection** can be used to create genetically modified animals where all of their cells contain the gene of interest.
- The gene is introduced into the zygote, the very first cell of the animal.

*Process*:
1. Egg cells from the animal are fertilized by sperms *in virto*.
2. Foreign DNA containing target gene is injected into <span class="hi-blue">fertilized eggs</span> using a very fine needle-like pipette viewed with a microscope.
3. Fertilized eggs are allowed to <span class="hi-green">grow and develop into embryos</span>.
4. The embryos are implanted into the uterus of the female animal (<span class="hi-blue">surrogate mother</span>).
5. The surrogate mother gives birth to offspring containing the target gene.

*Advantage*:
- Precise delivery of gene to the target cell.

*Limitations*:
- Injection can damage cells.
- Only one cell is targeted per injection.

## Viruses or liposomes
**Viruses or liposomes** can be used as vectors for transferring target genes into animal cells.

*Details*:
- Genome of the <span class="hi-blue">virus</span> is modified to remove disease-causing genes to insert the gene of interest.
- <span class="hi-blue">Liposomes</span> are small artificially prepared vesicles made of a <span class="hi-green">lipid bilayer</span> with the target gene enclosed in vesicles, which delivers the gene by fusing with the cell membrane.

*Advantage*:
- Ensure delivery of gene to specific host cell (with specific antigens).

*Limitations*:
- The desired gene is <span class="hi-green">inserted randomly</span> into the genome. It could be <u>inserted (incorrectly)</u> into the DNA sequence of another gene and affect the expression of that gene.
- May induce [[Primary and secondary response|immune response]], and prevent insertion of target gene.
