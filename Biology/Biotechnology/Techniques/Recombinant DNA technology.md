**Recombinant DNA technology** are techniques for <span class="hi-green">cutting</span> and <span class="hi-green">joining</span> DNA fragments to create <span class="hi-orange">recombinant DNA</span>. A <span class="hi-blue">gene of interest</span> (gene coding for particular proteins from donor cells) can be transferred from a donor organism to a host organism.

> [!warning] Comparison with PCR
> Recombinant DNA technology involves a host cell, biological systems can be used for <span class="hi-green">synthesizing protein molecules</span>.
> 
> PCR is a technique strictly for <span class="hi-orange">replicating specific DNA sequences <u>outside cells</u></span>, <span class="hi-green">proteins are not produced</span>.

# Principles

## Vectors
**Vectors** (e.g. bacterial <span class="hi-blue">plasmids</span>, <span class="hi-blue">viruses</span>) are DNA molecules used for transferring into a <span class="hi-blue">host cell</span> (commonly bacteria).

*Characteristics of plasmids*:
- <span class="hi-green">Circular double-stranded DNA</span> that <span class="hi-green">replicate independently</span> (extrachromosomal) of the bacteria chromosome.
- <span class="hi-green">Naturally transferred</span> between bacterial cells. (\*)
- Contain selective markers (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes) that may offer <span class="hi-green">survival advantages</span> to the bacteria, and can be used for [[#Selecting transformed bacteria|screening]].

## Procedures
*Producing recombinant DNA*:
1. **Isolation of gene of interest and vectors**
	- DNA fragments containing the <span class="hi-blue">gene of interest</span> are isolated from donor cells.
	- <span class="hi-blue">Vectors</span> (plasmids) are isolated from bacteria.

2. **Restriction** (cutting of DNA fragments and plasmids)
	- Restriction enzymes <span class="hi-green">recognize</span> and <span class="hi-green">cut</span> at specific base sequences (<span class="hi-blue">restriction sites</span>) on a piece of DNA.
	- The <span class="hi-green">same restriction enzyme</span> is used to cut open the plasmids, so the <span class="hi-green">same sticky ends</span> are produced to allow them to be <span class="hi-orange">ligated</span> together.
	- Different types of [[Sticky and blunt ends|ends of a DNA fragment]] are produced.

> [!note]
> Restriction enzymes are produced by bacteria as a <u>defense mechanism</u> against <span class="hi-blue">bacteriophages</span> by <span class="hi-green">cutting up viral DNA</span> before it can be integrated into the bacteria chromosome and replicates.

3. **Ligation** (joining of DNA fragments and plasmids)
	- Gene of interest is inserted into an open plasmid, and joined together with the help of <span class="hi-blue">DNA ligase</span>.
	- Resulting DNA molecule is called a <span class="hi-blue">recombinant plasmid</span>.

*Transforming bacteria*:
- <span class="hi-green">Introduce</span> recombinant plasmids into bacterial cells
- <span class="hi-green">Select</span> the <span class="hi-blue">transformed bacteria</span> by culturing the bacteria on <span class="hi-blue">nutrient agar</span> containing a specific antibiotic.
	- Some bacteria <span class="hi-green">may not become transformed</span> when they do not take up recombinant plasmids.
	- The insertion of target gene into a plasmid is a <span class="hi-green">random process</span>, some plasmids (with smaller size) may re-join without taking up the target gene.
	- Only the <span class="hi-green">transformed bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic</span>, so they survive and reproduce to form <span class="hi-blue">colonies</span>.

*Production of proteins*:
- <span class="hi-green">Induce</span> the expression of the gene to encode the protein product.
- <span class="hi-green">Extract</span> and <span class="hi-green">purify</span> the proteins produced.

↪️ *Example*: [[Production of human insulin]]

# Applications
*Medicine*:
1. **Production of pharmaceutical products**
   <span class="hi-green">Proteins molecules</span> are produced using [[genetically modified organisms]], useful for patients with diseases.

2. **Gene therapy** ([[Gene therapy|main article]])
   Transfers a normal gene into patient's abnormal cells (<span class="hi-blue">target cells</span>) in order to treat genetic diseases.

3. **Medical research**
   [[Genetically modified organisms]] (e.g. GM mice) are produced as models for studying human diseases.

*Agriculture and food production*: ([[Transgenic organisms]])
- Produces GM crops and animals with <span class="hi-green">increased productivity, resistance to pests or diseases, and nutritional values</span>.
- Less time-consuming than selective breeding.

*Industrial applications*:
- Produces GM bacteria that can produce [[Enzymes#Advantages of using enzymes in industrial processes|enzymes]] for use in industrial processes.

> [!tip] Advantages in industries
> - <u>Large amounts</u> of enzymes can be made in a <u>relatively short time</u> because of the high growth rate of bacteria.
> - Enzymes with <u>high purity</u> can be made, saving the cost of purifying them.
> - Enzymes can be modified to be <u>more effective</u> at desired temperatures, pH or other conditions in manufacturing processes.
> 
> *Refer to*: [[Production of pharmaceutical products]]

*Bioremediation*:
- Produces GM bacteria to <span class="hi-green">clean up oil spills, heavy metals, and radioactive wastes</span> by converting them into non-toxic compounds.
