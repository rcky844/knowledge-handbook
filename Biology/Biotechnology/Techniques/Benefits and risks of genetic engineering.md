# Benefits
- Providing scientists with new tools to study organisms at the molecule level. (e.g. <span class="hi-green">particular gene can be knocked out</span> to study its effect on organisms)
- Speeding up research in medical science and bringing advances in medicine. (e.g. genetic diseases)
- Opening up new possibilities for <span class="hi-green">solving food shortages</span> and providing ways to improve food quality. (e.g. GM crop plants)
- Enabling development of new tools for cleaning up <span class="hi-green">contaminated environment</span>. (e.g. break down hydrocarbons in oil spills)

# Risks / hazards
- The use of antibiotic resistance genes as selection markers raises concerns in creating <span class="hi-blue">multi-antibiotic-resistant bacteria (‘superbugs’)</span>.
- GM foods and recombinant drugs may cause <span class="hi-blue">allergic reactions</span> and their <span class="hi-green">long-term effects on our health are still unknown</span>.
- GMOs (<span class="hi-green">leaked outside laboratories or test fields</span>) may breed with wild types and <u>transfer their modified genes to the offspring</u>. GMOs may <span class="hi-blue">out-compete</span> wild types and <span class="hi-blue">upset the ecological balance</span>.
