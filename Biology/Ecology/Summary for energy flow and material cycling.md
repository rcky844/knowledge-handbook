#### Producers
- **Role in energy flow**
  Capture light energy and convert it to chemical energy that is stored in organic compounds through the process of photosynthesis.

- **Role in carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle**
	- Take up inorganic carbon and nitrogen from the environment and incorporate them into organic compounds in their bodies.
	- Return carbon to the environment in the form of carbon dioxide through respiration.

#### Consumers
- **Role in energy flow**
  Transfer chemical energy in the form of food along food chains through feeding.

- **Role in carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle**
	- Transfer carbon and nitrogen in organic compounds along food chains through feeding.
	- Return carbon to the environment in the form of carbon dioxide through respiration.

#### Decomposers
- **Role in energy flow**
  Break down dead organic matter, releasing energy in the form of heat during respiration.

- **Role in carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle**
  Return carbon and nitrogen in the form of inorganic compounds (e.g. carbon dioxide, nitrates) by breaking down the organic waste and dead bodies of organisms.
