**Species diversity** refers to the variety of species in a community. It is determined by two factors:

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Species richness</span>
  Number of different species in a community.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Relative abundance</span>
  Proportion of the community that each species occupies.

The higher the species richness and the more similar the relative abundances of different species, the greater the species diversity.

A **dominant species** is the species that is the most abundant (or occupies the highest biomass) in a community. They have a strong influence on the composition and diversity of the community.
