The **trophic level** refers to the feeding position that an organism occupies in a food chain or food web. Similar to a food chain, the first trophic level is occupied by producers, where all other trophic levels consist of consumers.

#### Efficiency of energy flow
Energy transfer between different trophic levels is inefficient. Only a small proportion of energy at one level is available to the next level.

Along the food chain, energy is lost in the following ways:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">As heat</span>
  Organisms lose energy to the surroundings in the form of heat as they carry out cellular respiration. Energy lost in this manner cannot be recycled in the ecosystem. A constant input of energy into the ecosystem from the Sun is needed to sustain life.
 
- <span style="color: lightgreen">As excretory products (e.g. urea)</span>
  Not available to organisms at higher trophic levels.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">As faeces</span>
  Some parts of an organism (e.g. cellulose from plants, bones and hair in mammals) are indigestible. They still store energy but are [[Large intestine#Egestion|egested]] in faeces.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">In uneaten dead bodies</span>
  Some organisms die without being eaten. Its energy is not transferred to higher levels.

Energy in excretory products, faeces and uneaten dead bodies become food for decomposers, which break down dead organic matter and release heat energy.

A food chain normally does not consist of more than five trophic levels as the fifth trophic level does not get enough energy to support further levels.
