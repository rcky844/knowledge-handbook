#### Transfer of nitrogen along food chain
1. **Feeding**
   - Nitrogen in the form of organic compounds (e.g. proteins, DNA) is transferred along the food chain from producers to consumers through feeding.

#### Adding nitrogen to the soil
2. **Decomposition**
   - Decomposers (e.g. putrefying bacteria and fungi) break down organic waste and dead bodies of organisms and convert the nitrogen to ammonium compounds.
   
   **Nitrification**
   - Nitrifying bacteria in the soil convert ammonium compounds to nitrites ($\ce{NO2-}$) and to nitrates ($\ce{NO3-}$).

3. **Lightning**
   - Nitrogen in the atmosphere combine with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides ($\ce{NO_x}$).
   - The oxides dissolve in rain water and form nitrates ($\ce{NO3-}$) in the soil.

4. **Nitrogen fixation**
   - Nitrogen fixing bacteria (free-living in soil or lie in the <span style="color: violet">root nodules</span> of leguminous plants (e.g. pea, soybean)) convert <u>nitrogen gas to ammonium compounds</u> and supply nitrogenous compounds to the plants.
   - When the bacteria die, the ammonium compounds present in them are released by decomposition and converted into nitrates by nitrification.

> **Note**:
> - Farmers who implement regenerative farming may first plant leguminous plants to increase the vitality and health of the farmland. This helps build soil health, diversify rotations, and allow enough time in the fall for growers to be able to plant a cover crop.

#### Removing nitrogen from the soil
5. **Mineral absorption in plants**
   - Producers (plants) take up nitrogen from the soil, mainly in the form of nitrates ($\ce{NO3-}$), to make proteins and other nitrogenous compounds.
<br>
6. **Denitrification**
   - Under [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] conditions, denitrifying bacteria in the soil convert nitrates to nitrogen gas, which is then released into the atmosphere.

#### Roles of bacteria in the nitrogen cycle
- **Nitrifying bacteria**: Converting ammonium compounds to nitrates or nitrites.
- **Denitrifying bacteria**: Converting nitrates to nitrogen gas.
- **Nitrogen fixing bacteria**: Converting nitrogen gas to ammonium compounds.
