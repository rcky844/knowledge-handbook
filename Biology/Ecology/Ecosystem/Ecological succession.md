**Ecological succession** is a series of progressive changes in the composition of a biotic community (species & habitat) over time.

Changes in the habitat affects organisms, while organisms can also change the habitat. New species that are better adapted for the habitat may be attracted into it and replace the original species. Eventually, the biotic community reaches a climax community.

A **climax community** is reached when the habitat supports the most diverse community it is capable of. The community is generally stable, although it can be affected by seasonal changes.

The climax community is only replaced when there are drastic changes (e.g. natural disasters, human disturbances).

#### Primary succession
**Primary succession** occurs in a barren area where no communities existed previously, with only bare rocks present. The process of primary succession can take hundreds of years.

**Examples**:
- Lava flows from volcano and hardens
- Glacier retreats

**Pioneer species** are the first species to colonize a barren area. They form the <span style="color: violet">pioneer community</span> and modify the environment gradually to provide suitable conditions for colonization by a succession of communities.

**Process of primary succession**:

> **Note**:
> The processes below are based on the  names of the habitat during the process of primary success.

1. <span style="color: lightgreen">Bare rocks</span>
   The environment is <u>abiotic</u>.

2. <span style="color: lightgreen">Lichens and mosses</span>
	- Spores of lichens and mosses are carried to bare rocks by wind. They colonize rock surfaces and form the <span style="color: violet">pioneer community</span>.
	- Soil gradually develops as rocks break down and organic matter accumulates.

3. <span style="color: lightgreen">Ferns and grasses</span>
	- The soil becomes thick enough to support smaller plants, such as ferns and grasses.
	- As they grow, they replace the lichens and mosses and become the <span style="color: violet">dominant species</span>.
	- They provide food and shelter for smaller animals, such as insects.

4. <span style="color: lightgreen">Shrubs</span>
	- Soil continues to form. Larger plants, such as shrubs, start to grow.
	- Shrubs grow over ferns and grasses and become the <span style="color: violet">dominant species</span>.
	- More animals, such as birds and small mammals, are attracted to the habitat.
	- <span style="color: violet">Humus</span> formed from the decomposition of organic wastes and dead bodies of organisms enrich the soil.

5. <span style="color: lightgreen">Trees</span>
	- The soil becomes thick and rich enough to support the growth of trees.
	- The canopy of trees over-shadow the shrubs and they become the <span style="color: violet">dominant species</span>. The habitat becomes a woodland.
	- More animals join the community, a <span style="color: violet">climax community</span> is reached.

#### Secondary succession
**Secondary succession** occurs when a disturbance has destroyed an existing community.

**Examples**:
- Abandoned agricultural fields
- After wildfires, storms or floods

**Differences to primary succession**:
- Starts with a more complex pioneer community (e.g. annual herbaceous plants)
	- Soil may contain seeds, roots and underground vegetative parts of plants. They can grow and develop into new plants when conditions become favourable.
- Occurs more rapidly as soil already exists.
