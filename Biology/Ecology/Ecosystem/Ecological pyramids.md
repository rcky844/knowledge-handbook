**Ecological pyramids** show the distribution of materials and energy among the trophic levels of an ecosystem. They are represented by bar charts, which can be upright or inverted.

In ecological pyramids, the producer always occupies the bottom of the pyramid. Energy is lost to the surroundings from one trophic level to the next so less and less energy is available to organisms at higher trophic levels.

> **Note**:
> - An organism may belong to more than one trophic level, it cannot easily be assigned to a single trophic level.
> - Energy flow to decomposers is often not shown in ecological pyramids.

#### Pyramid of numbers
**Pyramid of numbers** shows the number of organisms at each trophic level in an ecosystem in a given area at any one time.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Advantages</span>
  It is relatively easy to collect data and information to construct pyramids of numbers.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Disadvantages</span>
  Size of each organism is not taken into account. Each organism is counted as one, irrespective of its size.

  This pyramid is inverted. <u>The producer has a much higher biomass than the consumer, and so the producer can support many consumers.</u>

#### Pyramid of biomass
**Pyramid of biomass** shows the total mass of organisms (often [[Growth parameters#Dry mass|dry mass]]) at each trophic level in a given area at one time.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Advantages</span>
	- It can more accurately represent the amount of energy passed on at each trophic level.
	- The amount of energy stored in an organism is proportional to the amount of living material in its body.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Disadvantages</span>
  It is more difficult to collect data and information to construct pyramids of numbers.

  This pyramid is inverted. Biomass of producers (phytoplankton) at any time point is small as they are eaten rapidly by the primary consumers (zooplanktons), but they reproduce rapidly (have high productivity) that the biomass produced each year is large enough to support large numbers of primary consumers.
