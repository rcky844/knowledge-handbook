#### Examples
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Lichen (on tree trunks or rock surfaces)</span>
  Lichen carries out photosynthesis to produce organic food for itself and the fungus.
  Fungus provides anchorage, absorbs water and minerals, and protects the lichen.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Sea anemones & Hermit crabs</span>
  Sea anemones obtain food remains from hermit crab and are carried about by them.
  Hermit crabs gain protection from anemones, which posses stinging cells on their tentacles for defence against predators.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Herbivores (e.g. cows, sheep)</span>
  Herbivores rely on mutualistic bacteria living in their intestines to break down the cellulose in the plants they eat.
  Bacteria receive shelter and a steady supply of food from the host.
