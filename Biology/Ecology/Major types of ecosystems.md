##### Rocky shores
- Coastal marine ecosystems consisting of rocks.
- Organisms are adapted to withstand strong waves and to resist desiccation when exposed to the air at low tides.

##### Mangroves
- Intertidal wetland ecosystems, commonly found in estuaries where freshwater streams meet the sea. The soil is waterlogged and has a high salt content (high salinity).
- Organisms need to adapt to the low water potential of the surrounding environment.

##### Freshwater streams
- Have water flowing from upstream to downstream.
- Speed of water flow affects the distribution and abundance of organisms.

##### Woodlands
- Dominated by broad-leaved trees in Hong Kong.
- Supports a wide variety of animals.

##### Grasslands
- Dominated by grasses and herbs.
- In Hong Kong, grasslands are found where frequent grazing or fire has prevented the growth of trees.
