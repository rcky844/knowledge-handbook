**Fossils** are preserved remains or traces of organisms. They provide information about the morphology of organisms living in the past.

#### Formation of fossils
*See also: [[Hydrocarbons from fossil fuels]]*
**Fossils** are commonly formed when a dead organism is buried in sediments.

**Fossils** can also be formed from preservation of dead organisms by <u>freezing or trapping in resina</u>.

#### Fossil records and evolution
For fossils found in sedimentary rocks:
![[fossils_sediment.webp|350]]

Comparing layer 1 and layer 3:
- Appeared later on Earth
- More complex in structure

**Determination of fossil layers**:
- Radioisotope dating (carbon-14) can be used to arrange fossils in a chronological sequence.

**Explanation of complexity**:
- **Similarities and differences**
  Any similarities formed suggest <u>existing life forms arose from pre-existing ones</u>, while the differences indicate organisms <u>gradually change over time</u>.

- **Differences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes**
  Simple life forms gradually adapted and become more complex. The greater diversity of fossils found in younger rocks supports the idea that different types of organisms have evolved from a common ancestor.

#### Limitations of using fossil records
Currently, there are <span style="color: skyblue">missing links</span> within the fossil records, the <span style="color: lightgreen">lack of a continuous fossil record of all the intermediate forms</span> between ancient species and modern species.

1. **Fossils can be damaged and incomplete.**
	- Natural processes (e.g. erosion, movement of Earth's crust) may damage fossils, leaving only incomplete fragments.

2. **Some organisms may not be fossilized.**
	- Organisms with soft bodies cannot be fossilized.
	- Some organisms may have died in conditions not favourable for fossil formation. (e.g. dead bodies in rainforests decay rapidly)

3. **Some fossils are trapped in inaccessible areas.**
   e.g. deep under the sea
