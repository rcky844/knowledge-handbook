##### Interactions between organisms and the environment
- Between organisms (symbiosis)
- Between the environment

##### Energy flow
- Energy flows from one organism to another in the form of chemical energy in food.
- Energy cannot be recycled and is eventually lost from the ecosystem in the form of heat.
- A constant input of energy is needed. Most ecosystems obtain energy from sunlight through photosynthesis by plants.

##### Material cycling
- Materials are cycled between the biotic and abiotic components.
- Elements that make up an organism will be returned to the environment when it dies. It will be taken up by organism in a cycle.
