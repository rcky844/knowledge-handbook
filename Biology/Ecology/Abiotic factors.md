#### Light
**Rate of photosynthesis**:
Light intensity affects the rate of [[photosynthesis]] and hence the growth of plants.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Terrestrial habitats</span>
	- Plants tend to reach a higher position (by growing tall or climbing up other plants) so that they are not blocked from sunlight. (e.g. Ivy)
	- Plants growing in shady areas have larger leaves to absorb more light for photosynthesis and/or more chlorophyll to absorb more sunlight, so the leaves appear darker.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Aquatic habitats</span>
	- Light intensity determines the distribution of plants, decreasing with increasing water depth.
	- Aquatic plants often live in shallow waters to receive more light got photosynthesis.

**Flowering of plants**:
Relative length of daylight and night-time can affect the <u>flowering of plants</u>.
- Some flower during late spring or early summer. (e.g. Iris)
- Some flower during late summer or autumn. (e.g. Chrysanthemum)

**Activities of animals**:
- Diurnal animals are active during the day and rest at night.
- Nocturnal animals are only active at night. They are adapted to live in dark environments. (e.g. owls, bats)

#### Temperature
Metabolic and structural adaptations of an organism determines the temperature range it may survive in.

**Distribution of plants**:
- Some survive in cold regions. (e.g. pine trees, wheat, cabbages)
- Some grow in warm tropical or subtropical regions.
  (e.g. bananas, pineapples, sugar cane)

**Seasonal activities of plants**:
- [[Germination of seeds]]
- [[Growth and development in flowering plants|Flowering]]
- [[Dispersal of seeds and fruits|Fruiting]]

**Regulation of body temperature**:
Animals are classified into two groups by regulation of body temperature.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Homoiotherms</span>
	- They can maintain a fairly constant body temperature by physiological means.
	- They can remain active irrespective of the environmental temperature.
	- They can inhibit a wider geographical range and hence a higher chance of survival.
  **Examples**: mammals and birds
	- Birds are able to maintain the body temperature by muscular contractions during flapping.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Poikilotherms</span>
	- They cannot maintain a constant body temperature, which varies with the environmental temperature.
	- These animal are restricted to areas with a narrower temperature range.
  **Examples**: fish, amphibians, reptiles

**Structural adaptations in animals**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Cold climates</span>
  They have a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, which helps reduce hear loss from the body and acts as an energy reserve. (e.g. seals)

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Hot climates</span>
  They have larger ears and longer limbs, giving them a larger surface area to promote heat loss (e.g. elephants)

**Behavioural methods in animals**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Hibernation</span>
  Metabolic rate becomes so slow that energy use and heat loss can be greatly reduced. (e.g. amphibians, reptiles, mammals)

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Migration</span>
  Species of birds and butterflies migrate to warmer regions during the winter.

#### Water availability
Rainfall is the major source of water for terrestrial organisms, while humidity would affect the rate of water loss.

**Adaptations of organisms living in dry habitats**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Xerophytes</span> (e.g. cacti)
	- They are adapted to survive in environments with little water. (e.g. deserts)
	- They have an extensive root system to absorb water from a large area.
	- They may store water in their stems.
	- They may be covered with a thick cuticle or have their leaves modified into spines to reduce water loss by transpiration.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Desert kangaroo rats</span>
	- They obtain most of their water from metabolism.
	- They have highly effective kidneys that produce very concentrated urine to reduce water loss through urination.
	- Their nasal passages help reabsorb moisture from exhaled air.
	- They are nocturnal and stay in cool holes during the day to reduce water loss by sweating.

#### Wind
It affects the distribution and growth of plants.
- Some depends on wind for pollination and dispersal of seeds.
  (e.g. cedar tree, dandelion)
- Wind direction affects the direction of growth of plants. (e.g. trees)

In windy conditions, plants are likely to lose a lot of water through transpiration. They may have fleshy leaves with a thick cuticle to prevent excessive water loss.

#### Water current
Strong winds cause strong waves crashing against shores. Shore animals have hard shells to protect them from strong waves.

**Mechanism to avoid being washed away**:
- Barnacles secrete a cement-like substance to attach to rock surfaces.
- Chitons and limpets have muscular foot to hold onto rocks.
- Crabs may hide under rocks.

**Characteristics of organisms living in fast-flowing streams**:
- They have a streamlined and flattened body, swimming against water current with little resistance.
- They have their mouth or fins modified to function like suckers, holding onto rocks.

#### Salinity
Refers to the concentration of dissolved salts in water. It determines the water potential of the environment, and the amount of water and minerals an organism can obtain from the environment.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Freshwater habitat</span>
  Organisms face a constant influx of water from the surrounding hypotonic medium, and must be able to remove excessive water from their bodies.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Salt water (sea water)</span>
  Marine organisms must be able to remove excessive salts and reduce water from their bodes. (e.g. mangrove plants)

> **Mangrove plants**:
> - Their roots are immersed in sea water.
> - Their leaves have salt glands to allow them to maintain osmotic balance by removing excessive salts.
> - Their leaves have thick cuticles to reduce water loss (by osmosis).

#### Oxygen concentration
Oxygen is needed for survival but rarely a limiting factor for terrestrial organisms, except at high attitude habitats or in waterlogged soil.

> **Mangrove plants**:
> They have aerial roots that grow above the waterlogged soil, with many lenticels to maximize the gas exchange with air.

**Factors that affect oxygen concentration in water**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Temperature</span>
	- When the temperature increases, the solubility of oxygen in water decreases, concentration of dissolved oxygen decreases.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Water movements</span>
	- Concentration of dissolved oxygen increases when water flows more quickly.
	- Turbulence and splashing can bring more water in contact with oxygen in air so that more oxygen can be dissolved in water.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Organic matter</span>
	- Concentration of dissolved oxygen decreases with more organic matter in water because the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms uses oxygen.

**Density of species**:
Concentration of dissolved oxygen determines the species and the number of organisms an aquatic habitat can support.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Cold, fast-moving water</span>
  They have higher concentration of dissolved oxygen, and more species that need high concentrations of dissolved oxygen. (e.g. trout)

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Warm, still water</span>
  They have lower concentration of dissolved oxygen, and more species that are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations. (e.g. carp)

**Special adaptations to obtain oxygen (aquatic insects)**:
Water scorpions can breathe through a breathing tube that extend out of the water.

#### Soil
Soil provides a place for elongation of roots and anchorage. Different properties of soil affects the types of animals present in the habitat.

**Size of soil particles**:
-  <span style="color: lightgreen">Sand</span>
	- Made up of relatively large soil particles with large air spaces.
	- It cannot provide enough anchorage for large plants.
	
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Silt & clay</span>
	- Made up of smaller particles and are more closely packed.
	- When flooded with water, they become waterlogged easily, so the oxygen content becomes very low (poorly aerated).

**Nutrient content**:
- Nutrients in soil mainly come from organic matter in animal droppings and the remains of dead organism.
- Humus formed from the decomposition of organic matter by detritivores (animals feeding on decomposing organic matter) and microorganisms help retain moisture and improve fertility of soil.

**Soil pH**:
Affects the solubility of inorganic ions in soil water and the amount of nutrients available to plants. (Optimal range: 5.5 ~ 7)
