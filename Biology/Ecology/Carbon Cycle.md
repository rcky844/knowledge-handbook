#### Removal of carbon dioxide from its environment
1. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans is taken up by producers during [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon is <u>fixed into organic compounds</u> stored in their bodies.

#### Transfer of carbon along food chains
2. Carbon in the form of organic compounds is transferred along the food chain from producers to consumers through feeding.
<br>
3. Organic waste and dead bodies of organisms become food for decomposers.

#### Releasing carbon dioxide to the environment
4. Respiration of producers and consumers breaks down organic compounds and releases carbon dioxide.
<br>
5. Decomposition of organic matter by decomposers releases carbon dioxide.
<br>
6. **Burning of fossil fuels**
   - Burning fossil fuels releases carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
   
   **Formation of fossil fuels**
   - Plants and animals that died and are buried underground may turn into fossil fuels (e.g. coal and oil) over million of years.
<br>
7. **Weathering of limestones**
   - Weathering of limestone releases carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
   - When limestone reacts with acids, carbon dioxide is released.
   
   **Formation of limestones**
   - Some marine organisms have shells made up of calcium carbonate. When they die, they sink to the seabed and their shell eventually form limestone (a kind of sedimentary rock).
   - Limestones may become lifted up to the land by Earth movements.
