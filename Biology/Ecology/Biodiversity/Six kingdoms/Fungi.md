**Fungi** is a kingdom consisting of eukaryotes. They can be unicellular (e.g. mushroom, bread mould) or multicellular (e.g. yeast).

They have a <u>cell wall</u> made of <span style="color: skyblue">chitin</span> (a nitrogen containing polysaccharide). They have no chlorophyll and cannot produce their own food.

Multicellular fungi live as a mesh of thread-like filaments collectively called a <span style="color: skyblue">mycelium</span>. Each filament is called a <span style="color: skyblue">hypha</span>.

Most fungi are <span style="color: skyblue">sarophytes</span>, which feed on dead organisms or non-living organic matter. Hyphae secrete enzymes onto the food and digest it outside their body. Soluble nutrients are then absorbed into the cells. Saprophytic fungi play a role in the [[Source of energy#Classification of organisms|recycling of materials in an ecosystem]].

Some fungi are <span style="color: skyblue">parasites</span> that may cause [[Types of pathogens#Fungi|diseases]].

#### Reproduction of fungi
- **Budding in yeast and *Hydra***
  The parent develops an outgrowth (bud), which grows larger and eventually breaks off as an offspring that is smaller than the parent, but is genetically identical to the parent.

- **Spore formation in fungi** (e.g. Bread mould)
  Reproduces by forming spores which can be carried over long distances by wind and will develop into a new fungus under suitable conditions.
