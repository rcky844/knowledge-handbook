**Plantae** is a kingdom consisting of multicellular eukaryotes consisting of plants. They are [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Autotrophs|autotrophs]] and have chlorophyll for carrying out [[photosynthesis]]. They have cell walls made up of cellulose.

Classification of plants ⤴️

#### Non-vascular plants
**Non-vascular plants** (e.g. <span style="color: lightgreen">mosses</span>) are generally <u>small</u> as they <u>lack vascular tissues</u> to support the plant body against gravity. They have simple leaves and stems, and have <u>no true roots</u>. However, they have root-like <span style="color: skyblue">rhizoids</span> to help them anchor to the substrate.

They usually live in <span style="color: lightgreen">damp, shady places</span>. Water and minerals can be <u>absorbed by the whole surface of the plant</u>. Minerals <u>move from cells to cells</u> within the plant by [[diffusion]] and [[osmosis]].

They reproduce by <span style="color: skyblue">spores</span>.

#### Vascular plants
**Vascular plants** have <span style="color: skyblue">vascular tissues</span> for the transport of materials and support. They have <u>true roots, leaves and stems</u>, and can grow larger and taller than non-vascular plants. Most of them are well adapted to dry habitats.

##### Ferns
**Ferns** are <span style="color: lightgreen">seedless</span> vascular plants.
- Most have large, feathery leaves. The young leaves are curled.
- They reproduce by <span style="color: skyblue">spores</span>, usually found on the underside of the leaves.

##### Conifers
**Conifers**, also **gymnosperms**, are a group of tall trees. Most of them are <span style="color: lightgreen">evergreen and have needle-shaped leaves</span>.
- They <u>do not produce flowers</u>. They reproduce by <span style="color: skyblue">naked seeds</span>, which are <u>enclosed in cones</u>.

**Examples**: pines, firs, cypresses

##### Flowering plants
**Flowering plants**, also **angiosperms**, are a diverse group of <u>vascular seed plants</u> that <span style="color: lightgreen">produce flowers</span>. Their seeds are <u>enclosed in a fruit formed from the ovary</u> of the flower.

| Characteristics | Monocots | Dicots |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Number of cotyledons in seeds | One | Two |
| Leaf venation | Parallel venation | Net venation |
| Number of petals in flowers | Usually three or multiples of three | Usually four or five or their multiples |
| Roots | Fibrous roots | Taproots |
| Examples | Grasses, sugar cane, orchids, lilies | *Hibiscus*, roses, sunflowers, cacti |
> **Note**:
> Cotyledons are the first leaves that emerge during [[germination of seeds]].
