**Archaebacteria** is a kingdom consisting of unicellular prokaryotes. Many of them live in extreme environments (e.g. hot springs, highly salty water, oxygen-free environments) where few or no other organisms survive.

Most of them have a cell wall, but its composition lack peptidoglycan and is different from that of [[eubacteria]]. The lipids that make up their cell membrane are unique and different from those in other organisms.

They are mostly heterotrophs, but some are autotrophs. They can live in oxygen-free environments such as marshes and the digestive tract of animals.
