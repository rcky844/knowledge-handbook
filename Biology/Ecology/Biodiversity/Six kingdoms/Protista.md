**Protista** are eukaryotes that have a <u>true nucleus</u> and other <u>membrane-bound organelles</u>. They live mainly in water or moist environments. Some are [[Types of pathogens#Protists|parasites]] living inside other organisms.

**Algae** (<u>plant-like protists</u>) are [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Autotrophs|autotrophs]] that can carry out photosynthesis to make food (e.g. *Spirogyra*, kelps).

**Protozoans** (<u>animal-like protists</u>) are [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Heterotrophs|heterotrophs]] that can move from place to place (e.g. *Amoeba*, *Paramecium*).

**Fungus-like protists** absorb nutrients from dead organisms or non-living organic matter, and reproduce by spores (e.g. slime moulds).
