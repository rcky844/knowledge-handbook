*Pre-context: [[Ecosystems]]*

**Biodiversity** refers to the wide variety of life forms on Earth.

The place where an organism lives is called a <u>habitat</u>. Organisms need to adapt to the specific conditions in their habitats in order to survive.

**Taxonomy** is the branch of classification biology. Classification of organisms allow biologists to study organisms in a systematic way, and also helps in identification of organisms.
