The **endoplasmic reticulum** (ER) is an extensive network of interconnected membrane-bound sacs that extends from the outer nuclear envelope to the periphery of the cell (i.e. cell membrane).

There are two specialised types of ER:
- Rough endoplasmic reticulum
	- Attached with [[Ribosomes]] on the surface.
	- Transports [[Proteins]] produced at the ribosomes.
	- Large quantities are present in protein-secreting cells.
	  (e.g. cells that secrete insulin in the pancreas)

- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
	- Involved in the synthesis and transport of [[Lipids]] within the cytoplasm.
	- Large quantities are present in lipid-secreting cells.
	  (e.g. cells that secrete male sex hormones in the testes / Leydig cells)
