**Archaebacteria** are <span style="color: lightgreen">unicellular prokaryotes</span>, with body size smaller than [[eubacteria]]. They are only observable with high magnification under a light microscope. They belong in the domain *Archaea*.

*Characteristics*:
- Live in <span style="color: lightgreen">extreme environments</spanN> (e.g. hot springs, highly salty water, oxygen-free environments - marshes, digestive tracts)
- Most <span style="color: lightgreen">have a cell wall</span>, with a <span style="color: aqua">composition lacking peptidoglycan</span> and different from that of [[eubacteria]]. The composition of their [[cell membrane]] is unique compared to other organisms.
- Can be <span style="color: lightgreen">beneficial or harmful</span> to animals.

*Locomotion*:
- Some have <span style="color: skyblue">flagella</span> or cilia for movement.
- Some secrete a slime layer and ooze over surfaces like slugs.

*Nutrition & energy*:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Autotrophic</span>: By [[photosynthesis]], acts as a producer.
- <span style="color: skyblue">Heterotrophs</span>: Breaks down and absorb material in dead or decaying organisms, acts as decomposer.

*Reproduction*:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Asexually</span>, by [[Asexual reproduction#Binary fission in bacteria|binary fission]]
- They can reproduce in a short amount of time.
