**Animals** (scientifically *Animalia*) are a diverse group of <span style="color: lightgreen">multicellular eukaryotes</span>. They belong in the domain *Eukarya*. They can be classified by the living habitats and anatomical characteristics.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span style="color: lightgreen">no cell walls</span>.
- Most can move from place to place
  (exceptions include primitive early organisms, like sponge)

*Nutrition*:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Heterotrophic</span>: Depend on other organisms for food, acts as consumers.

#### Invertebrates
**Invertebrates** are animals that <span style="color: lightgreen">do not have a vertebral column</span>.

*General characteristics*:
- Generally <span style="color: lightgreen">soft-bodied</span>, lacking a rigid internal skeleton for the attachment of muscles.
- Some have a <span style="color: skyblue">hydroskeleton</span> (e.g. jellyfish, earthworms), an <span style="color: orange">enclosed, liquid-filled cavity</span> using <span style="color: orange">liquid pressure</span> to provide support.
- Some have an <span style="color: skyblue">exoskeleton</span>. It is a <span style="color: orange">hard or tough outer shell</span>, providing a framework for support, protecting soft body tissues, and <span style="color: lightgreen">preventing water loss</span>.

#### Vertebrates
**Vertebrates** are animals that have a <span style="color: skyblue">vertebral column</span>, which form part of their internal skeleton of <u>bones or cartilage</u>.

##### Fish
**Fish** is a group of organisms living in water.

*Anatomical characteristics*:
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">grills</span> for gas exchange.
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">fins</span> for swimming and balancing in water.
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">streamlined body</span> that reduces resistance while swimming.
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">lateral lines</span> along each side of a fish's body, with <span style="color: lightgreen">sense organ</span> that detects changes in surrounding water pressure caused by predators or prey.
- <span style="color: skyblue">Ectotherms</span> - Mainly <span style="color: lightgreen">gain heat from the environment</span>, body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings. ([[Water#As a temperature buffer]])
- Most have a <span style="color: skyblue">swim bladder</span>, a sac-like organ <span style="color: lightgreen">containing gas</span> that allow them to go up an down by the changes in gas pressure.
- Most are covered with <span style="color: lightgreen">wet, slimy</span> <span style="color: skyblue">scales</span>.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span style="color: skyblue">external fertilization</span> (eggs fertilized outside the body).
- Gametes are released into the surrounding water, where fertilization takes place.

**Examples**: goldfish, eels, sharks, seahorses

##### Amphibians
**Amphibians** are organisms that live part of their live in water and part of their life on land.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span style="color: lightgreen">smooth / naked</span> <span style="color: skyblue">skin</span>.
- Tadpoles use <span style="color: lightgreen">grills for gas exchange</span>, adult amphibians use <span style="color: lightgreen">lungs and skin surface for gas exchange</span>.
- Most adults amphibians have four limbs.
- <span style="color: skyblue">Ectotherms</span> - Mainly <span style="color: lightgreen">gain heat from the environment</span>, body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span style="color: skyblue">external fertilization</span> (eggs fertilized outside the body).
- Gametes are released into the surrounding water, where fertilization takes place.

*Life cycle*:
- Fertilized eggs of amphibians hatch into <span style="color: skyblue">larvae</span> (or <span style="color: skyblue">tadpoles</span>), living in water.
- They undergo <span style="color: violet">metamorphosis</span> to change into adult form, which can live on land.

**Examples**: frog, toad, salamander

##### Reptiles
**Reptiles** are fully adapted to life on land.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">lungs</span> for gas exchange.
- Covered with <span style="color: lightgreen">dry, hard</span> <span style="color: skyblue">scales</span>, which <u>offer protection and prevent water loss</u>.
- <span style="color: skyblue">Ectotherms</span> - Mainly <span style="color: lightgreen">gain heat from the environment</span>, body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span style="color: skyblue">internal fertilization</span> (eggs are fertilized inside the female's body).
- Most lay eggs with a leathery or hard shell, preventing the eggs from desiccation on land and protects the embryo inside.

**Examples**: lizards, snakes, crocodiles, turtles

##### Birds
**Birds** are terrestrial and well-adapted for flight.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">lungs</span> for gas exchange.
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">feathers</span> covering their bodies and have dry scales on their legs.
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">fore limbs</span> modified into <span style="color: skyblue">wings</span>.
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">light-weight bones</span> <span style="color: lightgreen">containing cavities</span>, and a <span style="color: skyblue">beak</span> with <u>no teeth</u>.
- <span style="color: skyblue">Endotherms</span> - <span style="color: lightgreen">generate body heat internally by metabolism</span> to <span style="color: orange">maintain a stable body temperature</span>.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span style="color: skyblue">internal fertilization</span> (eggs are fertilized inside the female's body).
- Lay eggs with a leathery or hard shell.

**Examples**: eagles, hummingbirds, ostriches, penguins

##### Mammals
**Mammals** can be terrestrial or aquatic.

*Characteristics*:
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">lungs</span> for breathing.
- Have <span style="color: skyblue">hair</span> <u>covering their bodies</u>.
- Many have <span style="color: lightgreen">sweat glands</span> in their skin, producing sweat to help cool the body.
- Have limbs specialized for their way of locomotion.
- <span style="color: skyblue">Endotherms</span> - <span style="color: lightgreen">generate body heat internally by metabolism</span> to <span style="color: orange">maintain a stable body temperature</span>.

*Reproduction*:
- Sexual, through <span style="color: skyblue">internal fertilization</span> (eggs are fertilized inside the female's body).
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Female carry the embryo (later fetus)</span> during the gestation period, and have <span style="color: skyblue">placentas</span> for material exchange.
- Females have <span style="color: skyblue">mammary glands</span>, which [[Birth process and parental care#Breast-feeding and its benefits|produce milk]] after the birth of offspring.

**Examples**: humans, rabbits, dogs, pigs, bats, whales, dolphins
