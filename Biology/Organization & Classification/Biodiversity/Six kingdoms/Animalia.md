**Animalia** is the kingdom consisting of multicellular eukaryotes. They have <u>no cell walls</u> and are usually [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs|heterotrophs]] and depend on other organisms for nutrients.

Most animals are able to <u>move</u> from place to place, and they are adapted to live in a variety of habitats (both aquatic and terrestrial).

Classification of animals ⤴️

#### Invertebrates
**Invertebrates** are animals that <span style="color: lightgreen">do not have a vertebral column</span>. They are generally soft-bodied animals that lack a rigid internal skeleton for the attachment of muscles.

- Some of them have a <span style="color: skyblue">hydroskeleton</span> (e.g. jellyfish, earthworms). It is an <u>enclosed, liquid-filled cavity</u> using <u>liquid pressure</u> to provide support.
- Some of them have an <span style="color: skyblue">exoskeleton</span>. It is a <u>hard or tough outer shell</u>, providing a framework for support, protecting soft body tissues, and <u>preventing water loss</u>.

#### Vertebrates
**Vertebrates** are animals that have a <span style="color: skyblue">vertebral column</span>, which form part of their internal skeleton of <u>bones or cartilage</u>.

##### Fish
**Common characteristics**:
- They have <span style="color: skyblue">grills</span> for gas exchange.
- They have <span style="color: skyblue">fins</span> for swimming and balancing in water.
- They have <span style="color: skyblue">streamlined body</span> that reduces resistance while swimming.
- There are <span style="color: skyblue">lateral lines</span> along each side of a fish's body, a <span style="color: lightgreen">sense organ</span> that detects changes in water pressure caused by predators or prey in the surrounding water.
- They are <span style="color: skyblue">ectotherms</span> and mainly <span style="color: lightgreen">gain heat from the environment</span>. Their body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings.

**Specific characteristics**:
- Most have a <span style="color: skyblue">swim bladder</span>, a sac-like organ that <span style="color: lightgreen">contain gas</span>. By changing the amount of gas in the bladder, it allows them to move up or down.
- Most are covered with <span style="color: lightgreen">wet, slimy</span> <span style="color: skyblue">scales</span>.
- Most reproduce by <span style="color: skyblue">external fertilization</span> (eggs fertilized outside the body). They release gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization takes place.

**Examples**: goldfish, eels, sharks, seahorses

##### Amphibians
**Characteristics**:
- They have <span style="color: lightgreen">smooth / naked</span> <span style="color: skyblue">skin</span>.
- Most begin life in water as <span style="color: skyblue">larvae</span> (or <span style="color: skyblue">tadpoles</span>) and then live on land as adults.
- Tadpoles use <u>grills for gas exchange</u>, adult amphibians use <u>lungs and skin surface for gas exchange</u>.
- Most adults amphibians have four limbs.
- They are <span style="color: skyblue">ectotherms</span> and mainly <span style="color: lightgreen">gain heat from the environment</span>. Their body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings.
- They reproduce by <span style="color: skyblue">external fertilization</span> (eggs fertilized outside the body). The females release eggs and the males release sperms into the water for fertilization. Fertilized eggs develop and hatch into tadpoles, which the undergo metamorphosis to change into adult form.

**Examples**: frog, toad, salamander

##### Reptiles
**Characteristics**:
- They are fully adapted to life on land.
- They have <span style="color: skyblue">lungs</span> for gas exchange.
- They are covered with <span style="color: lightgreen">dry, hard</span> <span style="color: skyblue">scales</span>, which <u>offer protection and prevent water loss</u>.
- They are <span style="color: skyblue">ectotherms</span> and mainly <span style="color: lightgreen">gain heat from the environment</span>. Their body temperature varies with the temperature of their surroundings.
- They reproduce by <span style="color: skyblue">internal fertilization</span> (eggs are fertilized inside the female's body).
	- After fertilization, most of them lay eggs with a leathery or hard shell.
	- The shell prevents the eggs from drying out on land and protects the embryo inside.

**Examples**: lizards, snakes, crocodiles, turtles

##### Birds
**Characteristics**:
- They are terrestrial and well-adapted for flight.
- They have <span style="color: skyblue">lungs</span> for gas exchange.
- They have <span style="color: skyblue">feathers</span> covering their bodies and have dry scales on their legs.
- Their <u>fore limbs</u> are modified into <span style="color: skyblue">wings</span>.
- They have <span style="color: skyblue">light-weight bones</span> that <span style="color: lightgreen">contain cavities</span>, and a <span style="color: skyblue">beak</span> with <u>no teeth</u>.
- They are <span style="color: skyblue">endotherms</span> and can <u>generate body heat internally by metabolism</u> to <u>maintain a relatively constant body temperature</u>.
- They reproduce by <span style="color: skyblue">internal fertilization</span> (eggs are fertilized inside the female's body) and lay eggs with a leathery or hard shell.

**Examples**: eagles, hummingbirds, ostriches, penguins

##### Mammals
- They can be terrestrial or aquatic.
- They have <span style="color: skyblue">lungs</span> for breathing.
- They have <span style="color: skyblue">hair</span> <u>covering their bodies</u>. The skin of many mammals has <span style="color: lightgreen">sweat glands</span>, producing sweat to help cool the body.
- They have limbs specialized for a particular way of moving.
- They are <span style="color: skyblue">endotherms</span> and can <u>generate body heat internally by metabolism</u> to <u>maintain a relatively constant body temperature</u>.
- **Female mammals** have <span style="color: skyblue">mammary glands</span>, which [[Birth process and parental care#Breast-feeding and its benefits|produce milk]] after the birth of offspring.
	- Milk contains the nutrients the young mammal needs, and antibodies to help the young fight off diseases.

**Examples**: humans, rabbits, dogs, pigs, bats, whales, dolphins
