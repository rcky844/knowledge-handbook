**Eubacteria**, also simply **bacteria**, are small (0.5 ~ 5.0 µm) <span style="color: lightgreen">unicellular prokaryotes</span>. They are only observable with high magnification under a light microscope. They belong in the domain *Bacteria*.

![[bacteria_structure.webp|400]]

*Characteristics*:
- Live in <span style="color: lightgreen">moderate environments</spanN> (e.g. digestive tracts of humans)
- Come in many shapes — <span style="color: orange">spherical, rod-shaped or spiral</span>
- Have <span style="color: lightgreen">no true nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles</span>.
- Have a <span style="color: lightgreen">circular chromosome</span> lying free in the cytoplasm, and small rings of DNA called <span style="color: skyblue">plasmid</span>.
- Have a rigid cell wall made of <span style="color: skyblue">peptidoglycan</span>.
- Some have a <span style="color: skyblue">capsule</span> outside the cell wall.
- Can be <span style="color: lightgreen">beneficial or harmful</span> to animals.

*Locomotion*:
- Some have <span style="color: skyblue">flagella</span> or cilia for movement.
- Some secrete a slime layer and ooze over surfaces like slugs.

*Nutrition & energy*:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Autotrophic</span>: By [[photosynthesis]], acts as a producer.
  (e.g. cyanobacteria contains chlorophyll)
- <span style="color: skyblue">Heterotrophs</span>: Breaks down and absorb material in dead or decaying organisms, acts as decomposer.

*Reproduction*:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Asexually</span>, by [[Asexual reproduction#Binary fission in bacteria|binary fission]]
- They can reproduce in a short amount of time.
