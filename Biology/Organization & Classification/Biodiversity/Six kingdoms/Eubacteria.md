**Eubacteria** is a kingdom consisting of unicellular prokaryotes. They have <u>no true nucleus</u> or other <u>membrane-bound organelles</u>. They can come in many shapes — spherical, rod-shaped or spiral.

They have a circular chromosome lying free in the cytoplasm. There are also small rings of DNA called <span style="color: skyblue">plasmid</span>.

Their cell wall is rigid and made of <span style="color: skyblue">peptidoglycan</span>. Some bacteria have a <span style="color: skyblue">capsule</span> outside the cell wall. Some have <span style="color: skyblue">flagella</span> for <u>locomotion</u>.

Some bacteria are [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Autotrophs|autotrophs]], but most are [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Heterotrophs|heterotrophs]] instead.
- Cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll and can carry out photosynthesis to make their own food.

Some bacteria can cause [[Types of pathogens#Bacteria|diseases]]. However, most are harmless or even beneficial.
- Some bacteria live in the intestines to help us use the nutrients from the food we eat.
