# Structure & adaptations
*See also: [[Gas exchange in plants]] / [[Photosynthesis]]*

## Leaf blade
- **Broad**: Provide a <span class="hi-green">large surface area</span> for gas exchange, and absorbing light for photosynthesis.
- **Flat and thin**: <span class="hi-green">Shorten the diffusion distance</span> for gases to reach the mesophyll cells (between internal and external environment), as well as allowing <span class="hi-green">light</span> to reach photosynthetic cells easily.

## Epidermis
- **Closely-packed cells**: Protect the inner tissues of the leaf from <span class="hi-blue">mechanical damage and infections</span>.
- **Covered by a thin waxy cuticle**: <span class="hi-green">Impermeable</span> to water and <span class="hi-green">reduces the loss of water</span> by evaporation.
- **Transparent cuticle & epidermis**: Most epidermal cells <u>do not contain chloroplasts</u>, which <span class="hi-green">allows light to penetrate</span> and reach the photosynthetic mesophyll beneath them.

## Mesophyll
*Palisade mesophyll*:
- **Tightly-packed columnar cells**: <span class="hi-green">Higher density of chloroplasts</span> for carrying out photosynthesis.
- **Located on upper layer of leaves**: Cells are under direct illumination by sunlight and helps <span class="hi-green">maximize the amount of light absorbed</span> for photosynthesis.

*Spongy mesophyll*:
- **Loosely-packed cells**: Lower density of chloroplasts than palisade mesophyll.
- **Lots of large air spaces**: Provides a <span class="hi-green">large surface area</span> and allows gases to diffuse freely inside the leaf for gas exchange to facilitate photosynthesis.
- **Presence of moist water film**: Water film covering the surfaces of these cells allows gases to first dissolve in it and <span class="hi-green">diffuse into cells readily</span>.

> [!tip] Experiment on presence of air spaces
> When a leaf is put into a hot water bath, the air in the air spaces expands and bubbles appear on the surface of the leaf.

## Stomata and guard cells
![[leaf_stomata.webp|480]]

*Stomata*:
- Allow gases to pass into or out of the leaf <span class="hi-blue">rapidly for gas exchange</span>.
- In <span class="hi-green">bright sunlight</span>, the size of the stoma will become larger, <span class="hi-green">more carbon dioxide in air could diffuse</span> through stomatal pores into the air spaces, photosynthesis occurs at a higher rate.
- <u>Lower epidermis of leaves contains more stomata</u> than the upper epidermis. This can <span class="hi-green">reduce water loss</span> as the temperature of the upper epidermis is higher under direct sunlight.
- They are also present on stems of herbaceous plants for gas exchange.

> [!info]
> The difference in density of stomata can be observed by peeling off the upper and lower epidermis, and observing them under the microscope separately.

*Guard cells*:
- Surrounds the stomata to allow <span class="hi-green">regulation of the size</span> of stomata and <span class="hi-green">rate of gas exchange</span>.
- The inner wall is thicker than the outer wall. This allows the <span class="hi-green">outer wall to stretch more than the inner wall</span> for the cell to bend when it is turgid, <span class="hi-blue">opening the stomata</span> for gas exchange.
- Aquatic plants have no guard cells as <u>gas exchange occurs all over the plant surfaces</u>.

## Vascular bundles
*See also: [[Transport of substances]]*

**Vascular bundles** in the midrib and veins consists of two types of vascular tissues â€” <span class="hi-blue">xylem</span> (transports water and minerals) and <span class="hi-blue">phloem</span> (transports food).

# Differences of leaves in different plants
*See also: [[Gas exchange in plants]]*

*Terrestrial plants*: (e.g. moss leaf)
- Has <span class="hi-blue">no stomata, no cuticle</span> and their leaves are <span class="hi-blue">one-cell thick</span>.
- Survives only in <span class="hi-green">moist and shady environments</span> as they have large surface area to volume ratio with a higher rate of water loss.
- Atmospheric gases and carbon dioxide <span class="hi-green">dissolves in the water film on the leaf</span> and then diffuses in and out through the entire surface of the leaf.

*Submerged leaves of aquatic plants*:
- Surrounded by bodies of water, and has <span class="hi-blue">no stomata and cuticle</span> on the leaf surface, as there is no danger of desiccation.
- <span class="hi-green">Leaf surface is permeable</span>, so dissolved gases can diffuse directly into the leaves all over their surfaces.

*Floating leaves*: (e.g. water lily)
- Has stomata and cuticle only on the <span class="hi-blue">upper epidermis</span>.
- <span class="hi-green">Dissolved gases</span> can directly diffuse into the leaves through the <span class="hi-blue">lower epidermis</span>.

*Woody plants*:
- Have stems surrounded by <span class="hi-blue">cork</span> (an outer layer of protective tissues) that is <span class="hi-green">impermeable to gases</span>.
- With <span class="hi-blue">lenticels</span> (small openings) where cork cells are <span class="hi-green">loosely packed</span> to allow gas exchange.
