**Roots** <span class="hi-green">anchor</span> the plant in the soil and <span class="hi-green">absorb water and minerals</span>.

![[root_structure.webp]]

*Structures*:
- **Epidermis**: <span class="hi-green">Protects the inner tissues</span> from injuries and infections.
- **Root cap**: <span class="hi-green">Protects the root tip</span>, where its cells have to be continually replaced as they are rubbed off when the root grows through soil.
- **Cortex**: Made up of layers of <span class="hi-blue">thin-walled cells</span> to store food, and allow water and minerals to move across the root.
- **Vascular bundle**: Consists of <span class="hi-blue">xylem</span> (transports water and minerals) and <span class="hi-blue">phloem</span> (transports food), located in the center of the root.

*Adaptations (absorption of water & minerals)*:
- The epidermis is <span class="hi-green">not covered by cuticle</span>, so <span class="hi-blue">water and minerals</span> can enter the root easily, and allow [[Gas exchange in plants|gas exchange]] to occurs freely.
- The epidermis consists of one layer of <span class="hi-blue">closely-packed thin-walled cells</span>, while root hair cells have <span class="hi-blue">thin cell walls</span>. This provides a short [[diffusion]] distance for water and minerals.
- Roots are <span class="hi-blue">highly branched</span> and <span class="hi-blue">root hairs are numerous</span>. This <span class="hi-green">increases the surface area for absorption</span> of water and minerals.
- Roots have <span class="hi-blue">long and fine root hairs</span> (outgrowths). This allows the roots to reach into spaces between soil particles to <span class="hi-green">absorb water and minerals more efficiently</span>.
- Root hair cells contain many [[mitochondria]] to provide energy for the absorption of minerals by [[active transport]].

*Absorption (water in roots)*:
1. **Water is absorbed into the root hair cells by [[osmosis]].**
   The cytoplasm and cell sap of root hair cells contain dissolved substances, the <u>water potential of root hair cells is usually lower than that of soil water</u>.

2. **Water moves from the root hair cells into the neighbouring cells.**
	- Water moves inwards from cell to cell by [[osmosis]] down a water potential gradient (water potential of root hair cells > neighbouring cells in cortex; due to water absorption) across the cortex.
	- Some of the water moves between the cell walls of adjacent cells without entering the cytoplasm or the vacuole of the cells.

3. **Water is drawn up by transpiration pull created by the evaporation of water from the leaves.**

*Absorption (minerals in roots)*:
- **Normal conditions**: Concentration of mineral ions in root hair cells is <u>higher than surrounding soil water</u>. Mineral ions are taken up into the root by [[active transport]] <span class="hi-green">against a concentration gradient</span> requiring energy from [[respiration]].
- **Abnormal conditions**: Concentration of mineral ions in root hair cells is <u>lower than surrounding soil water</u>. Minerals enter the root hair cells by [[diffusion]] <span class="hi-green">down the concentration gradient</span>.
