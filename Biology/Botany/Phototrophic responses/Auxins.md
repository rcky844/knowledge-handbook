**Auxins** are a group of plant hormones produced in the apical meristem at the tip of shoots and roots. They are transported to the regions of elongation, stimulating the cells to elongate and hence promote growth.

#### Mechanisms of phototropic responses in shoots and roots
When the plant is illuminated from all directions:
![[phototrophic_all.webp|500]]
- Auxins are produced in the shoot tip and root tip.
- The auxins distribute evenly under illumination from all directions in the regions of elongation of the shoot and the root.
- The shoot grows straight up without bending, while the root grows straight down without bending.
\
When the plant is illuminated with unilateral light:
![[phototrophic_uni.webp|600]]
- Unilateral light causes auxins to be transported from the illuminated side to the shaded side of the shoot or the root.
- The high auxin concentration stimulates shoot growth on the shaded side, and therefore the shoot bends towards the light.
- The high auxin concentration inhibits root growth on the shaded side, and therefore the root bends away from the light.

#### Effects of different concentrations of auxins
For example, in the following graph:
![[auxins_graph.webp|550]]

- Auxin concentrations from 10<sup>-6</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> ppm promote root growth, but are insufficient to promote shoot growth.
- Auxin concentrations from 10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> ppm promote both shoot and root growth.
- Auxin concentrations from 10<sup>-2</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> ppm promote shoot growth, but inhibit root growth.
- Auxin concentrations above 10<sup>2</sup> ppm inhibit both shoot and root growth.

#### Discovery of auxins
![[auxins_coleoptile.webp|500]]
Phototropism was investigated using **coleoptiles** in the past to find out how they are able to detect light and respond to it.

A **coleoptile** is a protective sheath that covers the first leaf of a monocotyledonous seedling as the young shoot emerges from the soil.

**Coleoptiles** are suitable for experiments because:
- They are fast-growing.
- They are easy to handle.
- They have a simple structure for easy observation.

##### Experiments on discovering auxins
> **Note**:
> Some of the experiments below were performed in darkness to eliminate the effect of light.

###### Charles Darwin’s experiment on phototropism (1880)
![[auxins_exp1.webp|600]]

**Conclusions**:
- Unilateral light is detected by the tip of the coleoptile.
- Bending growth (response) did not occur in the tip itself but in the region below the tip.

Darwin made the hypothesis that a signal must be transmitted from the tip to the lower part of the coleoptile.

###### Boysen-Jensen’s experiments on nature of signal transmission (1913)
![[auxins_exp2.webp|500]]

**Observations**:
An agar block inserted between the tip and the lower part of each coleoptile did not affect growth, the coleoptile grew and bent towards the light.

**Conclusions**:
The mica plate (which is impermeable to chemicals) blocked the transmission of the signal from the tip to the lower part of the coleoptile. The signal transmitted from the tip to the lower part of the coleoptile is proved to be chemical in nature.

![[auxins_exp3.webp|500]]

**Conclusions**:
The chemical produced by the tip passes down the shaded side of the coleoptile.

###### Frits Went’s experiments (1926)
![[auxins_exp4.webp|600]]

**Conclusions**:
- The agar block contained the chemical produced by the tip of the coleoptile.
- This chemical stimulated growth as it passed down the decapitated coleoptile.
- The decapitated coleoptile bent to one side because of a higher concentration of the growth-promoting chemical on the other side.

![[auxins_exp5.webp|600]]

**Conclusions**:
Unilateral light had caused an uneven distribution of the chemical ([[Auxins]]) and the shaded side had a higher concentration of the chemical.
