The elements needed by plants are classified into two groups:
- **Major elements (macronutrients)**
  They are used to <u>make organic compounds</u>, e.g. nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), Sulphur (S).

- **Trace elements (micronutrients)**
  They are used for <u>regulating metabolism</u>, e.g. iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn).

Below lists the details of some elements:
**Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)**
- **Ion absorbed by plants**: Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) / Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>)
- **Main functions**: Synthesis of amino acids, nucleic acids, chlorophyll
- **Deficiency diseases**:
	- Poor growth
	- Chlorosis (Yellow leaves)

**Phosphorus (P)**
- **Ion absorbed by plants**: Phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>)
- **Main functions**: Component of nucleic acids, ATP, cell membranes
- **Deficiency diseases**:
	- Poor growth of roots
	- Purple patches on leaves

 **Magnesium (Mg)**
 - **Ion absorbed by plants**: Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>)
 - **Main functions**: Synthesis of chlorophyll
 - **Deficiency diseases**:
	 - Poor growth
	 - Chlorosis (Yellow leaves)

**Potassium (K)**
- **Ion absorbed by plants**: Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>)
- **Main functions**: For photosynthesis and transport of substances
- **Deficiency diseases**:
	- Poor growth of flowers and fruits
	- Curled leaves with brown edges
