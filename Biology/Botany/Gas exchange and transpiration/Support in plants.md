#### Turgidity of thin-walled cells
<span style="color: lightgreen">Herbaceous stems</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">non-woody parts</span> of plants (e.g. leaves) consist mostly of <u>thin-walled cells</u>. They rely mainly on the turgidity of these cells for support.

- **Sufficient water supply**: Pith and cortex gain water from xylem vessels by osmosis and becomes <span style="color: gold">turgid</span>, keeping stems firm to stand upright.

- **Insufficient water supply**: Transpiration rate becomes higher than water absorption rate (e.g. on hot dry days), pith and cortex becomes flaccid, the stem is no longer supported by turgidity, the plant <span style="color: gold">wilts</span>.

#### Rigidity of thick-walled cells
**Thick-walled cells** provide mechanical support.
- Cell walls of xylem vessels are thick and lignified, making them hard and rigid.
- Supports plants even without sufficient water supply, as they consists of dead cells.

<span style="color: lightgreen">Woody plants</span> are supported mainly by <span style="color: gold">rigidity of xylem vessels</span>.
- Older xylem tissues are pushed towards the centre as the plant grows, developing into wood as they are further hardened with lignin and forms annual rings.
- Wood contributes to the strength of woody stems.

Vascular bundles are arranged in a ring to resist the bending force of the wind.
