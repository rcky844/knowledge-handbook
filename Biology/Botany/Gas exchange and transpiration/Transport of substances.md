#### Xylem
![[xylem.webp]]

The **xylem** transports water and minerals.

##### Adaptations for transporting water and minerals
- **Xylem vessels are long and hollow tubes, made up of dead, elongated cells with no cytoplasm and no nuclei. There are also no end walls between adjacent cells.**
  This allows a free flow of water with little resistance.

- **Xylem vessels are thick and lignified.**
  This provides <u>mechanical support</u> to keep the vessels open, even with the negative pressure created during transpiration pull.

#### Phloem

The **phloem** transports organic nutrients (e.g. sucrose and amino acids) within the plant.

##### Adaptations for transporting organic nutrients
- **Sieve tubes have cytoplasm but no nucleus.**
  This allows organic nutrients to flow with little resistance.

- **Sieve plates have many small pores.**
  This allows organic nutrients to move from cell to cell.

- **Companion cells have cytoplasm, a nucleus and a large number of mitochondria.**
  This is to provide energy for metabolic activities ([[Active transport]] of organic nutrients) of the sieve tube.

#### Distribution of vascular tissues.

- **In leaves**: xylem is above phloem

- **In stems**: xylem (outer), phloem (inner)

- **In roots**: xylem (star), phloem (‘planets’)

#### Process of transporting water and minerals
- As leaves transpire (evaporation of water vapour), the water potential of the mesophyll cells becomes lower. Water moves from xylem vessels into the mesophyll cells by [[Osmosis]].
- The loss of water from the xylem vessels in the leaves creates transpiration pull (a pulling force) that draws water up the xylem vessels from the roots to the leaves.
- The transpiration pull eventually draws water from the xylem vessels of the roots, which creates a water potential gradient from the xylem vessels to the root epidermis.
- The water potential of the root hair cells becomes lower than that of the soil water, and water moves into the root hair cells by osmosis.

#### Translocation of organic nutrients
The **translocation of organic nutrients** takes place through the phloem.
- Carbohydrates synthesized in the leaves are first converted into sucrose.
- Sucrose is then transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant where it is then used or stored.
	- Growing regions (e.g. buds and root tips)
	- Storage tissues (e.g. in the fruits and roots)

##### Ringing experiment
> **TODO**: This part is currently in consideration for addition for the following reason:
> *The experiment could be used to demonstrate the position of the vascular tissues.*
