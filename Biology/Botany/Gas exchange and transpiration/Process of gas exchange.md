**Gas exchange** in plants rely on passive ventilation (diffusion only).

#### In leaves
##### Into the leaf
1. Gases in the surroundings diffuse down their concentration gradients into the air spaces through the stomata.
2. Gases first dissolve in the water film on the surface of spongy mesophyll cells and then diffuse into the cells.
3. Gases diffuse into the neighbouring cells.

##### Out of the leaf
1. Gases diffuse from cell to cell down their concentration gradients toward the air spaces.
2. Gases diffuse from the water film on the surface of spongy mesophyll cells into the air spaces.
3. Gases diffuse out of the leaf through the stomata.

#### In roots

- Due to the absence of cuticle, gas exchange occurs all over the root surface.
- Root hairs provide a large surface area for diffusion of gases.
- Oxygen in soil air diffuses into the root hairs and epidermal cells.
- Carbon dioxide produced by respiration diffuses out of the cells into soil air.
