**Transpiration** is the process where a plant loses water in the form of water vapour by <u>evaporation</u>.

Most plants absorb water from the soil continuously, but only a very small amount s used by the plants in [[photosynthesis]] and other cellular activities. Most of the water absorbed by the plant is lost through transpiration, which occurs mainly through the stomata. Small portions of water is lost through the cuticle present on surfaces of leaves and herbaceous stems, and lenticels of woody stems.

#### Significance
- **Creates transpiration pull**
  Transpiration pull is the main force which [[Transport of substances|transports water and dissolved minerals up the xylem vessels from the roots to the leaves]].

- **Absorption of water and dissolved minerals**
  Water is lost to absorb water by transpiration pull. It can be described as a 'necessary evil'.

- **Prevents over-heating in hot weather**
  Water takes away heat from the plant surfaces when it evaporates, reducing the temperature of the plant.

#### Effects of environmental factors
##### Relative humidity
![[transpiration_relative_humidity.webp|200]]

<u>The rate of transpiration decreases with increasing relative humidity</u>, or when there is a higher concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere.

This is because a higher relative humidity decreases the concentration gradient of water vapour between the air spaces in the leaves and the surrounding air. Thus, water vapour will diffuse out of the air spaces more slowly.

##### Temperature
![[transpiration_temperature.webp|200]]

<u>The rate of transpiration increases with air temperature</u>, as a higher temperature increases the rate of water evaporation from the surfaces of mesophyll cells. Furthermore, air can hold more water vapour at higher temperature (relative humidity of the surrounding air is lowered).

The concentration gradient of water vapour between the air spaces and the atmosphere is increased.

##### Air movement

In still air, water vapour accumulates around the stomata after it has diffused out of the leaves. This reduces the concentration gradient of water vapour between the air spaces and the atmosphere, Water vapour diffuses out of the leaves more slowly.

In windy conditions, the rate of transpiration increases under windy conditions. Air current carry water vapour away from the leaf surfaces, increasing the concentration gradient of water vapour between the air spaces and the surrounding air.

##### Light intensity
![[transpiration_light.webp|200]]

The rate of transpiration increases with light intensity. As the light intensity increases, the stomata opens wider, more water vapour in the air spaces diffuses out of the leaves.

Furthermore, the leaf temperature increases at higher light intensities, as light intensity is usually correlated with illumination by sunlight.

##### Availability of water
- Adequate soil water allow plants to transpire at higher rates as the soil can provide enough water to replenish the loss.
- Dry soil will make the plant undergo water stress, as water loss is not replenished, and the stomata closes, decreasing the rate of transpiration.

#### Internal factors affecting transpiration
**Density and distribution of stomata on leaves**
In terrestrial dicotyledonous plants, there are fewer stomata on the upper epidermis of the leaves. This reduces water loss when the leaves are directly exposed to sunlight.

**Leaf area**
The greater the total area of a plant, the more cuticle and stomata will be present, the greater is the rate of transpiration.

#### Adaptations to prevent excessive water loss
*See also: [[Leaves]]*

**Waxy cuticle covering the epidermis**
The epidermis is covered by a layer of waxy cuticle that is impermeable to water, reducing evaporation of water from the inner tissues of the leaves.

**Guard cells control the size of the stomata**
When light is not available for [[photosynthesis]] or the plant becomes [[Water (Photosynthesis)|dehydrated]], the stomata close and water loss from the leaves is reduced.

**Distribution of stomata**
The upper epidermis usually has fewer stomata than the lower epidermis. This is because the upper surface of the leaves is directly lit by sunlight and its temperature will be higher. Having fewer stomata on the upper epidermis reduces the transpiration rate of the leaves.
