The elements needed by plants are classified into two groups:
- **Major elements (macronutrients)**
  They are used to <u>make organic compounds</u>, e.g. nitrogen ($\ce{N}$), phosphorus ($\ce{P}$), magnesium ($\ce{Mg}$), potassium ($\ce{K}$), calcium ($\ce{Ca}$), Sulphur ($\ce{S}$).

- **Trace elements (micronutrients)**
  They are used for <u>regulating metabolism</u>, e.g. iron ($\ce{Fe}$), zinc ($\ce{Zn}$), copper ($\ce{Cu}$), manganese ($\ce{Mn}$).

Below lists the details of some elements:
**Nitrogen ($\ce{N2}$)**
- **Ion absorbed by plants**: Nitrate ($\ce{NO3-}$) / Ammonium ($\ce{NH4+}$)
- **Main functions**: Synthesis of amino acids, nucleic acids, chlorophyll
- **Deficiency diseases**:
	- Poor growth
	- Chlorosis (Yellow leaves)

**Phosphorus ($\ce{P}$)**
- **Ion absorbed by plants**: Phosphate ($\ce{PO4^3-}$)
- **Main functions**: Component of nucleic acids, ATP, cell membranes
- **Deficiency diseases**:
	- Poor growth of roots
	- Purple patches on leaves

 **Magnesium ($\ce{Mg}$)**
 - **Ion absorbed by plants**: Magnesium ($\ce{Mg^2+}$)
 - **Main functions**: Synthesis of chlorophyll
 - **Deficiency diseases**:
	 - Poor growth
	 - Chlorosis (Yellow leaves)

**Potassium ($\ce{K}$)**
- **Ion absorbed by plants**: Potassium ($\ce{K+}$)
- **Main functions**: For photosynthesis and transport of substances
- **Deficiency diseases**:
	- Poor growth of flowers and fruits
	- Curled leaves with brown edges
