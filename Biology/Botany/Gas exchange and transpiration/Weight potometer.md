- Same precautions should be applied to this set-up as in the set-up with the bubble potometer.

- Volume of water absorbed is equal to the drop in water level in the burette, while the volume of water loss by transpiration is the decrease in the weight of the whole set-up.

- The amount of water absorbed is slightly greater than the amount of water lost by the leafy shoot. This indicates that some water is retained in the shoot. The water is used in photosynthesis, growth and other metabolic activities.
