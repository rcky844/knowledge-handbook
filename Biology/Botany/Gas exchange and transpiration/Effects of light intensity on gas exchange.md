During [[photosynthesis]], the size of stomata becomes larger, more carbon dioxide can be absorbed and more oxygen can be released. On the contrary, stomata close in darkness.

- **A**: Low light intensity, photosynthesis < respiration
	- <u>Net uptake</u> of oxygen and net release of carbon dioxide.
	- Only respiration is carried out in darkness.

- **B**: At the compensation point, photosynthesis = respiration
	- <u>No net</u> exchange of gases.

- **C**: High light intensity, photosynthesis > respiration
	- Net uptake of carbon dioxide and net release of oxygen.

- **D**: Maximum photosynthesis, photosynthesis > respiration
	- Factors other than light intensity (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub> concentration) is in short supply and limits the rate of photosynthesis.
