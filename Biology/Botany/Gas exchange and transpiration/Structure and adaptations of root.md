The root anchor the plant in the soil and absorb water and minerals.

- The **epidermis** protects the inner tissues from injuries and infections.
- The **root cap** protects the root tip. Cells of the root tip have to be continually replaced as they are rubbed off when the root grows through soil.
- The **cortex** is made up of layers of thin walled cells to store food (e.g. starch grains) and allow water and minerals to move across the root.
- The **vascular bundle** in the center of the root consists of two types of vascular tissues â€” <u>xylem</u> (transports water and minerals) and <u>phloem</u> (transports food).

#### Adaptations for absorption of water and minerals
- **The epidermis is not covered by cuticle.**
  This allows water and minerals to enter the root easily and allow gas exchange to occurs freely.

- **The epidermis consists of one layer of closely-packed thin-walled cells and the root hair cells have thin cell walls.**
  This provides a short [[Diffusion]] distance for water and minerals.

- **Roots are highly branched and root hairs and numerous.**
  This increases the surface area for absorption of water and minerals.

- **Roots have long and fine root hairs (outgrowths).**
  This allows the roots to reach into spaces between soil particles to absorb water and minerals more efficiently.

- **Root hair cells contain many mitochondria.**
  Provide energy for the absorption of minerals by [[Active transport]].

#### Absorption of water in the roots
1. **Water is absorbed into the root hair cells by [[Osmosis]].**
   The cytoplasm and the cell sap of the root hair cells contain dissolved substances, the water potential of root hair cells is usually lower than that of soil water.

2. **Water moves from the root hair cells into the neighbouring cells.**
	- The water potential of root hair cells becomes higher than that of the neighbouring cells in the cortex because of water absorption.
	- Water moves inwards from cell to cell by [[Osmosis]] down a water potential gradient across the cortex.
	- Some of the water moves between the cell walls of adjacent cells without entering the cytoplasm or the vacuole of the cells.

3. **Water is drawn up by transpiration pull created by the evaporation of water from the leaves.**

#### Absorption of minerals in the roots
- **In normal conditions, root hair cells have higher concentrations of mineral ions than surrounding soil water.**
  Mineral ions are taken up into the root by [[Active transport]] against a concentration gradient and requires energy from respiration.

- **In abnormal conditions, root hair cells have lower concentrations of mineral ions than surrounding soil water.**
  Minerals enter the root hair cells by [[Diffusion]] down the concentration gradient.
