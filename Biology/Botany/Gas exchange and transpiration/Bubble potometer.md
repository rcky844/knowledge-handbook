- A leafy shoot should be cut under water to prevent air bubbles from entering the xylem vessels and blocking water uptake.

- All connections should be smeared with vaseline to prevent leakage of water.

- An air bubble should be introduced into the graduated capillary tube by lifting the open end of the capillary tube out of water.

- The rate of water uptake is found by calculating the rate of movement of the air bubble (unit: cm s<sup>-1</sup>), which is an indirect measurement of the rate of transpiration.
