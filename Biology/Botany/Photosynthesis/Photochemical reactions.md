**Photochemical reactions**, also called **light reactions**, are reactions driven by light energy that take place in the thylakoids of [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]] in plants. It is the first stage of [[photosynthesis]].

In the reaction, light energy is absorbed by [[chlorophyll]] and converted to chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. Water is split, releasing oxygen as a by-product.

##### Light absorption and electron transport

- When a chlorophyll molecule in the thylakoid membrane absorbs light energy, electrons are excited to higher energy levels and leave the chlorophyll molecule. They then pass through an electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane.
- The electron transport chain consists of a series of electron carriers arranged in order of decreasing energy levels. As an electron passes from one carrier of a higher energy level to another carrier of lower energy level, energy is released.

##### Photophosphorylation â€“ synthesis of ATP
![[photosynthesis_photochem_s2.webp|420]]

- **Description**
  Catalysed by the enzyme ATP synthase, some of the energy from electron transport is used to synthesize ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate.

- **Meaning of the naming**
  Phosphorylation: Addition of a phosphate to a molecule
  Photo-: Reaction is driven by energy coming from light

##### Photolysis of water
- **Description**
  Catalysed by several enzymes, some of the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

- **Process**
  Hydrogen is picked up by a NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) hydrogen accepter to form NADPH, which is reduced NADP.

- **By-product**
  Oxygen is produced as a by-product of the reaction. It is either used in respiration or released as a gas to the atmosphere.

#### Products from photochemical reactions
Light energy is converted to chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, with the release of oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis.

##### Uses of products in carbon fixation
- ATP will provide energy to drive the reactions of [[carbon fixation]].
- NADPH will act as a reducing agent, providing reducing power by donating hydrogen in [[carbon fixation]].
