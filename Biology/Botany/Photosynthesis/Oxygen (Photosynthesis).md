##### Involved processes
- [[Photochemical reactions#Photolysis of water]]
  Oxygen is produced as a by-product of photosynthesis.

##### Burning splint test
- The gas is collected and then tested with a glowing splint. If the splint relights, it shows that the gas produced has high oxygen content and indicates photosynthesis has occurred.
- The test is best performed with water plants, as oxygen can be collected easily by displacement of water.

1. Place some water plants (e.g. _Hydrilla_) in a beaker of dilute sodium hydrogencarbonate solution, which provides carbon dioxide for the plant to carry out photosynthesis.

2. Cover the plant with the filter funnel with rubber tubings. Put a test tube completely filled with dilute sodium hydrogencarbonate solution on top of the funnel.

3. Leave the setup in bright light for at least a day until a quarter of the test tube is filled with gas.

4. Remove the test tube carefully and immediately put a glowing splint over the mouth of the test tube to test for oxygen.
