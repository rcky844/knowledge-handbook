**Photosynthesis** is the process by which plants and other [[Heterotrophs and autotrophs#Autotrophs|autotrophs]] (e.g. algae) use energy from sunlight (light energy) to convert carbon dioxide and water to carbohydrates (e.g. glucose) as food and releasing oxygen as a by-product.

#### Word equation
carbon dioxide + water  $\xrightarrow[\text{by chlorophyll}]{\text{light energy captured}}$  glucose + oxygen

#### Metabolism
- Photosynthesis is an [[Anabolism|anabolic process]] in which complex organic molecules (carbohydrates) are synthesized from simple inorganic molecules (carbon dioxide and water).
- Light energy is effectively converted to chemical energy stored in organic molecules.

#### Significance
- **Sustaining plant life**: Photosynthesis provides essential materials for plants.
	- **Glucose**: Used in respiration to provide energy for cellular activities. Extra glucose can be converted to starch for storage or synthesized into cellulose for building cell walls.
	- **Other organic nutrients (e.g. proteins, lipids)**: Can be converted from intermediates of photosynthesis for metabolism and the growth of plants.

- **Providing food and maintaining the energy flow in ecosystems**
	- As producers in ecosystems, plant captures light energy from the Sun and converts it to chemical energy stored in their bodies, other organisms depend directly on plants for food and energy.
	- The stored chemical energy is transferred to consumers and decomposers along a food chain, providing a constant input of energy to maintain the energy flow and sustain life.

- **Maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere**
	- Respiration and combustion of fossil fuels use oxygen and produce carbon dioxide, lowering atmospheric oxygen levels and increasing carbon dioxide levels.
	- During photosynthesis, plants take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen, this helps maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

By the word equation of photosynthesis:
- If one of the factors is in short supply, it will limit the rate of photosynthesis, and so is called a <u>limiting factor</u>.

To study the effects of different factors on the rate of photosynthesis, we can measure:
- The rate of formation of products (e.g. oxygen and carbohydrates)
- The rate of use of raw materials (e.g. carbon dioxide)
