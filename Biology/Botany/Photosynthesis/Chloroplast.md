![[chloroplasts.webp]]
The **chloroplast** is an organelle surrounded by a <u>double membrane</u>, it is found in some cells of green plants.

- **Thylakoids**
  Disc-shaped membraneous sacs found on the thylakoid membrane. An extensive network of thylakoid membranes provide a large surface area for attachment of [[Chlorophyll]] molecules for the absorption of light.

- **Grana**
  Thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana (singular: granum), the stacking arrangement provides a large surface area in a limited space to pack more [[Chlorophyll]] for the absorption of light.

- **Interconnection of thylakoids with adjacent grana**
  This allows for efficient transport of photosynthetic products within the chloroplast.

- **Stroma**
  Jelly-like fluid that fills the space enclosed by the inner membrane of a chloroplast.
  It contains enzymes that catalyse some of the photosynthetic reactions.

- **Starch grains**
  Act as a temporary store of carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis.
