#### Experiment on its need in photosynthesis
![[photosynthesis_co2_test.webp|360]]

- **Set-up**
  Placing sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to remove carbon dioxide from the air in one side of the set-up.

- **Leaf A (experimental setup)**
  Can carry out photosynthesis to produce starch, which is stained blue-black in iodine test.

- **Leaf B (control setup)**
  Cannot carry out photosynthesis to produce starch, and is stained brown in iodine test.

#### Involved processes
- [[Carbon fixation#Carbon dioxide fixation and the formation of a 3-C compound]]
  Carbon dioxide is combined with a five-carbon (5-C) compound (a carbon dioxide acceptor) to form two molecules of a 3-C compound.

#### Rate of photosynthesis (Concentration)

#### Experiment
![[photosynthesis_light_rate_exp.webp|450]]
The experimental procedure can be similar to that in [[Light (Photosynthesis)#Experiment]].
Instead, the concentration of $\ce{NaHCO3}$ solution varies.

Note that:
- **Dependent variable**: Rate of photosynthesis *(volume of gas collected per unit time)*
- **Independent variable**: $\ce{CO2}$ concentration *(concentration of $\ce{NaHCO3}$ solution)
- **Control variables**: Temperature, Light intensity *(distance of light from the Hydrilla plant)*

Since the Earth's atmosphere has a relatively low carbon dioxide concentration of about 0.04%, <ins>carbon dioxide concentration</ins> usually limits the rate of photosynthesis. An increase in carbon dioxide concentration should increase the rate of photosynthesis, provided that other factors are not limiting.

- At low carbon dioxide concentrations, the rate of photosynthesis increases with an increase in carbon dioxide concentration because more carbon dioxide is available for carbon fixation.

- As the carbon dioxide concentration further increases, the rate of photosynthesis levels off because a factor other than carbon dioxide concentration limits it.
