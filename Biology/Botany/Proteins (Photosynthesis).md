#### Synthesis
- Plants can also combine the [[Carbohydrates (Photosynthesis)|intermediate compounds]] of photosynthesis with minerals (e.g. nitrate & sulphate) to form amino acids, which makes up proteins.
- Proteins are important for growth and repair. They form parts of the cytoplasm and cell membranes. Many important biomolecules (e.g. enzymes) are also proteins.
