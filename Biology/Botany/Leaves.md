***(TMP!!!)***

#### Structure & Adaptations

##### Leaf blade

- **Broad and flat**: Provide a large surface area for gas exchange, and absorbing light for photosynthesis.
- **Thin**: Shorten the diffusion distance for gases to reach the mesophyll cells, as well as allowing light to reach photosynthetic cells easily.

##### Epidermis

- **Closely packed cells**: Protect the inner tissues of the leaf from mechanical damage and infections.
- **Covered by a thin waxy cuticle**: Impermeable to water and reduces the loss of water by evaporation.
- **Cuticle & epidermis are transparent**: Most epidermal cells do not contain chloroplasts. This allows light to penetrate and reach the photosynthetic mesophyll beneath them.

##### Mesophyll

- **Palisade mesophyll with tightly-packed columnar cells**
	- Contains numerous / higher density of chloroplasts for carrying out photosynthesis.
	- Located on the upper layer of the leaf, so the cells are under direct illumination by sunlight. This help maximize the amount of light absorbed for photosynthesis.

- **Spongy mesophyll with loosely packed cells**
	- Contains fewer / lower density of chloroplasts than palisade mesophyll.
	- Forms a lot of large air spaces for gas exchange.
		- Provides a large surface area and allows gases to diffuse freely inside the leaf for gas exchange to facilitate photosynthesis.
		- When a leaf is put into a hot water bath, the air in the air spaces expands and bubbles appear on the surface of the leaf.
	- Water film covers the surfaces of spongy mesophyll cells. This allows gases to first dissolve in it and diffuse into the cells readily.

##### Stomata and guard cells
![[leaf_stomata.webp|480]]

- **Contains numerous stomata**: Allow gases to pass into or out of the leaf rapidly.
	- Carbon dioxide in air diffuses through stomatal pores into air spaces of palisade mesophyll, the size of the stoma will affect the rate of photosynthesis.
	- The lower epidermis of leaves contains more stomata than the upper epidermis. This can reduce water loss since the temperature of upper epidermis is higher as it is under direct sunlight.
		- This can be observed under the microscope by peeling off the upper and lower epidermis.
	- Also present on stems of herbaceous plants for gas exchange.

- **Guard cells surrounds the stomata**: Allow regulation of the size of the stomata and rate of gas exchange.
