#### Structure & Adaptations
*See also: [[Gas exchange in plants]], [[Photosynthesis]]*

##### Leaf blade
- **Broad**: Provide a <u>large surface area for gas exchange</u>, and absorbing light for photosynthesis.
- **Flat and thin**: <u>Shorten the diffusion distance for gases to reach the mesophyll cells</u> (between internal and external environment), as well as allowing light to reach photosynthetic cells easily.

##### Epidermis
- **Closely packed cells**: Protect the inner tissues of the leaf from mechanical damage and infections.
- **Covered by a thin waxy cuticle**: Impermeable to water and reduces the loss of water by evaporation.
- **Transparent cuticle & epidermis**: Most epidermal cells do not contain chloroplasts. This allows light to penetrate and reach the photosynthetic mesophyll beneath them.

##### Mesophyll
- **Palisade mesophyll with tightly-packed columnar cells**
	- Contains numerous / higher density of chloroplasts for carrying out photosynthesis.
	- Located on the upper layer of the leaf, so the cells are under direct illumination by sunlight and helps maximize the amount of light absorbed for photosynthesis.

- **Spongy mesophyll with loosely packed cells**
	- Contains fewer / lower density of chloroplasts than palisade mesophyll.
	- Forms a lot of large air spaces for gas exchange.
		- Provides a large surface area and allows gases to diffuse freely inside the leaf for gas exchange to facilitate photosynthesis.
		- When a leaf is put into a hot water bath, the air in the air spaces expands and bubbles appear on the surface of the leaf.
	- Water film covers the surfaces of spongy mesophyll cells. This allows gases to first dissolve in it and diffuse into the cells readily.

##### Stomata and guard cells
![[leaf_stomata.webp|480]]

- **Contains numerous stomata**: Allow gases to pass into or out of the leaf rapidly.
	- Carbon dioxide in air diffuses through stomatal pores into air spaces of palisade mesophyll, the size of the stoma will affect the rate of photosynthesis.
	- The lower epidermis of leaves contains more stomata than the upper epidermis. This can reduce water loss since the temperature of upper epidermis is higher as it is under direct sunlight.
		- This can be observed under the microscope by peeling off the upper and lower epidermis.
	- Also present on stems of herbaceous plants for gas exchange.

- **Guard cells surrounds the stomata**: Allow regulation of the size of the stomata and rate of gas exchange.
	- When the cell is turgid, the outer wall will stretch more than the inner wall and the cell will bend. The stomata opens to facilitate gaseous exchange.
	- Aquatic plants have no guard cells as gas exchange occurs all over the plant surfaces.

##### Vascular bundles
**Vascular bundle** in the midrib and veins consists of two types of vascular tissues â€” <u>xylem</u> (transports water and minerals) and <u>phloem</u> (transports food).


#### Differences of leaves in different plants
*See also: [[Process of gas exchange (plants)]]*

> **FIXME**: The descriptions below may focus heavily on the example of plants.

Some <u>terrestrial plants</u> (e.g. moss leaf) has <span style="color: lightgreen">no stomata, no cuticle and their leaves are one-cell thick</span>.
- Since its surface area to volume ratio is large, it would lead to a higher rate of water loss from the plant. Therefore, it can only survive in a moist and shady environment.
- <span style="color: red">Atmospheric gases and carbon dioxide dissolves into the water film</span> on the leaf and then diffuses in and out through the entire surface of the leaf.

<u>Submerged leaves of aquatic plants</u> are surrounded by bodies of water and has no stomata and cuticle on the leaf surface, as there is no danger of desiccation.
- This allows the leaf surface to be permeable. Dissolved gases can diffuse directly into the leaves all over their surfaces.

<u>Leaves floating on water</u> (e.g. water lily) has stomata and cuticle only on the upper epidermis.
- Dissolved gases can directly diffuse into the leaves through the lower epidermis.

Woody plants have stems surrounded by cork (an outer layer of protective tissues) that is impermeable to gases.
- However, there are lenticels (small openings) whee cork cells are loosely packed to allow gas exchange.
