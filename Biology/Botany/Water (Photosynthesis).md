##### Involved processes
- [[Photochemical reactions#Photolysis of water]]
  Oxygen is produced as a by-product of photosynthesis.

##### Experiment on its need in photosynthesis
- Unfortunately, it is not possible to remove all the water from a plant for investigation as it is also required in many metabolic reactions other than photosynthesis.
