**Gas exchange** in plants rely on <span class="hi-green">passive ventilation</span> ([[diffusion]] only).

# In leaves
## Into the leaf
1. Gases in the surroundings diffuse down their concentration gradients <u>into</u> the <span class="hi-blue">air spaces</span> through the stomata.
2. Gases first <span class="hi-green">dissolve in the water film</span> on the surface of spongy mesophyll cells and then diffuse into the cells.
3. Gases diffuse into the neighbouring cells.

## Out of the leaf
1. Gases diffuse from cell to cell down their concentration gradients <u>toward</u> the <span class="hi-blue">air spaces</span>.
2. Gases <span class="hi-green">diffuse from water film</span> on the surface of spongy mesophyll cells into the air spaces.
3. Gases diffuse out of the leaf through the stomata.

# In roots
![[gas_exchange_roots.webp|420]]
- Due to the <span class="hi-green">absence of cuticle</span>, gas exchange occurs all over the root surface.
- Root hairs provide a <span class="hi-green">large surface area</span> for [[diffusion]] of gases.
- Oxygen in soil air diffuses into the root hairs and epidermal cells.
- Carbon dioxide produced by [[respiration]] diffuses out of the cells into soil air.
