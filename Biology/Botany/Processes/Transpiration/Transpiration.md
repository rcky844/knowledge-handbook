**Transpiration** is the process where a plant loses water in the form of water vapour by <span class="hi-green">evaporation</span>.

Most plants <u>absorb water from soil continuously</u>. Most of the water absorbed by a plant is <span class="hi-green">lost through transpiration</span>, only a very small amount is used by the plants in [[photosynthesis]] and other cellular activities.

*Loss of water*:
- Most of the water is lost through the <span class="hi-blue">stomata</span>.
- Small portions of water are lost through the <span class="hi-blue">cuticle</span> present on surfaces of leaves and herbaceous stems, and <span class="hi-blue">lenticels</span> of woody stems.

# Process

# Significance
- **Setting up transpiration pull**
  Transpiration pull is the main force which [[Transport of substances|transports water and dissolved minerals up the xylem vessels from the roots to the leaves]].

- **Absorption of water and dissolved minerals**
  Water is lost in order to absorb water by transpiration pull, a form of 'necessary evil'.

- **Prevents over-heating in hot weather**
  Water takes away heat from the plant surfaces when it evaporates, reducing the temperature of the plant.

# Effects of environmental factors
## Relative humidity
![[transpiration_relative_humidity.webp|200]]

*Effects*: Rate of transpiration <span class="hi-blue">decreases</span> with increasing relative humidity.
(higher concentration of water vapour in atmosphere)

*Explanation*:
- A higher relative humidity <span class="hi-green">decreases the concentration gradient</span> of water vapour between air spaces in leaves and surrounding air.
- Water vapour diffuses out of the air spaces more slowly.

## Temperature
![[transpiration_temperature.webp|200]]

*Effects*: Rate of transpiration <span class="hi-blue">increases</span> with increasing relative humidity.

*Explanation*:
- A higher temperature <span class="hi-green">increases the rate of water evaporation</span> from surfaces of mesophyll cells.
- Air can hold more water vapour at higher temperature (relative humidity of surrounding air is lowered), so concentration gradient of water vapour between air spaces and atmosphere is increased.

## Air movement
![[transpiration_wind.webp|200]]

*In still air*: Lower transpiration rate
- Water vapour <span class="hi-green">accumulates around the stomata</span> after diffusing out of the leaves.
- Concentration gradient of water vapour between air spaces and atmosphere is reduced, water vapour diffuses out of the leaves more slowly.

*In windy conditions*: Higher transpiration rate
- <u>Air current</u> carries water vapour away from the leaf surfaces.
- Concentration gradient of water vapour between air spaces and atmosphere is increased, water vapour diffuses out of the leaves more quickly.

## Light intensity
![[transpiration_light.webp|200]]

*Effects*: Rate of transpiration <span class="hi-blue">increases</span> with light intensity.

*Explanation*:
- As light intensity increases, the <span class="hi-green">stomata opens wider</span>, more water vapour in the air spaces diffuses out of the leaves.
- Leaf temperature increases at higher light intensities, as light intensity is usually correlated with illumination by sunlight.

## Availability of water
- Adequate soil water allow plants to transpire at higher rates as the soil can provide enough water to replenish the loss.
- Dry soil will make the plant undergo <span class="hi-blue">water stress</span>, as water loss is not replenished, the <span class="hi-green">stomata closes</span>, decreasing the rate of transpiration.

# Effects of internal factors
- **Density and distribution of stomata on leaves**
  In <span class="hi-blue">terrestrial dicotyledonous plants</span>, there are fewer stomata on the upper epidermis of the leaves. This reduces water loss when the leaves are directly exposed to sunlight.

- **Leaf area**
  The greater the total area of a plant, the <span class="hi-green">more cuticle and stomata</span> will be present, the greater is the rate of transpiration.

# Adaptations to prevent excessive water loss
*See also: [[Leaves]]*

- **Waxy cuticle covers the epidermis**
  The epidermis is covered by a layer of waxy cuticle that is <span class="hi-green">impermeable to water</span>, reducing evaporation of water from the inner tissues of the leaves.

- **Guard cells control the size of the stomata**
  When light is not available for [[photosynthesis]] or the plant becomes [[Water (Photosynthesis)|dehydrated]], the <span class="hi-green">stomata close</span> and water loss from the leaves is reduced.

- **Distribution of stomata**
  The upper epidermis usually has <span class="hi-green">fewer stomata</span> than the lower epidermis to reduce the transpiration rate of the leaves, as the upper surfaces of leaves are directly lit by sunlight and its temperature will be higher.
