*Aim*: To measure the rate of transpiration

*Limitations*:
- A potometer can only measure the rate of water uptake.

*Assumptions*:
- The rate of water uptake is the same as the rate of transpiration.

> [!tip]
> Some water is retained in the shoot for [[photosynthesis]], growth and other metabolic activities.

*Precautions*:
- A leafy shoot should be <u>cut under water</u> to <span class="hi-green">prevent air bubbles</span> from entering the xylem vessels and <span class="hi-green">blocking water uptake</span>.
- All connections should be smeared with <span class="hi-blue">vaseline</span> to <u>prevent leakage of water</u>.

*Calculation*:
- The rate of water uptake is found by calculating the rate of movement of the air bubble (unit: $\pu{cm s-1}$), which is an indirect measurement of the rate of transpiration.
