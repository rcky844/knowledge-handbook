*Procedural details*:
- A leafy shoot should be <u>cut under water</u> to <span class="hi-green">prevent air bubbles</span> from entering the xylem vessels and <span class="hi-green">blocking water uptake</span>.
- All connections should be smeared with <span class="hi-blue">vaseline</span> to <u>prevent leakage of water</u>.
- An air bubble should be introduced into the graduated capillary tube by lifting the open end of the capillary tube out of water.

*Calculation*:
- The rate of water uptake is found by calculating the rate of movement of the air bubble (unit: cm s<sup>-1</sup>), which is an indirect measurement of the rate of transpiration.
