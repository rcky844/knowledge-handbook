# Xylem
The **xylem** transports water and minerals.

*Structural features*:
- Long and hollow
- Made up of dead, elongated cells with no cytoplasm and nuclei
- Has no end walls between adjacent cells
- Thick and lignified

> [!tip] Adaptations of xylem
> - The xylem vessels form a hollow tube with <span class="hi-green">little resistance</span>.
> - Thick and lignified vessels provide <span class="hi-green">mechanical support</span> to keep the vessels open, even with negative pressure created during transpiration pull.

# Phloem
The **phloem** transports organic nutrients (e.g. sucrose and amino acids) within the plant.

*Structural features & adaptations*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Sieve tubes</span> <u>have cytoplasm but no nucleus</u>. This allows organic nutrients to <span class="hi-green">flow with little resistance</span>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Sieve plates</span> have <u>many small pores</u>. This allows organic nutrients to move from cell to cell.
- <span class="hi-blue">Companion cells</span> have cytoplasm, a nucleus, and <u>large numbers of mitochondria</u> to provide energy for metabolic activities ([[active transport]] of organic nutrients) of the sieve tube.

# Distribution of vascular tissues
- **In leaves**: xylem is above phloem
  ![[vasculardist_leaves.webp|450]]

- **In stems**: xylem (outer), phloem (inner)

- **In roots**: xylem (star), phloem (‘planets’)

# Process of transporting water and minerals
1. Transpiration <span class="hi-green">lowers the water potential</span> of mesophyll cells. Water moves from xylem vessels into the mesophyll cells by [[osmosis]].
2. Loss of water from xylem vessels of leaves <span class="hi-green">creates transpiration pull</span> to draw water up the xylem vessels from roots to leaves.
3. Transpiration pull <span class="hi-green">draws water from xylem vessels of roots</span>, creating a water potential gradient from xylem vessels to the root epidermis.
4. Water potential of root hair cells becomes <span class="hi-green">lower than soil water</span>. Water moves into root hair cells by [[osmosis]].

# Translocation of organic nutrients
- Takes place through the phloem.
- Carbohydrates synthesized in the leaves are first converted into <span class="hi-blue">sucrose</span>, which is then transported from leaves to other parts of the plant for use or storage.

*Usage of organic nutrients*:
- **Growing regions** (e.g. buds and root tips)
- **Storage tissues** (e.g. in the fruits and roots)

## Ringing experiment
> **TODO**: This part is currently in consideration for addition for the following reason:
> *The experiment could be used to demonstrate the position of the vascular tissues.*
