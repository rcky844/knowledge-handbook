# Turgidity of thin-walled cells
<span class="hi-green">Herbaceous stems</span> and <span class="hi-green">non-woody parts</span> of plants (e.g. leaves) consist mostly of <span class="hi-blue">thin-walled cells</span>. They rely mainly on the turgidity of these cells for support.

- **Sufficient water supply**: Pith and cortex gain water from xylem vessels by osmosis and becomes <span class="hi-blue">turgid</span>, keeping stems firm to stand upright.

- **Insufficient water supply**: Transpiration rate becomes higher than water absorption rate (e.g. on hot dry days), pith and cortex becomes flaccid, the stem is no longer supported by turgidity, the plant <span class="hi-blue">wilts</span>.

# Rigidity of thick-walled cells
**Thick-walled cells** provide mechanical support.
- Cell walls of xylem vessels are <span class="hi-blue">thick and lignified</span>, making them <span class="hi-green">hard and rigid</span>.
- Supports plants even without sufficient water supply, as they consists of <span class="hi-green">dead cells</span>.

<span class="hi-green">Woody plants</span> are supported mainly by <span class="hi-blue">rigidity of xylem vessels</span>.
- Older xylem tissues are pushed towards the centre as the plant grows, developing into wood as they are further hardened with lignin and forms <span class="hi-blue">annual rings</span>.
- Wood contributes to the strength of woody stems.

Vascular bundles are arranged in a ring to resist the bending force of the wind.
