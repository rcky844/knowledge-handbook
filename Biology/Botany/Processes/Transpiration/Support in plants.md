# Turgidity
**Turgidity** is a means of support for <span class="hi-green">herbaceous stems</span> and <span class="hi-green">non-woody parts</span> of plants (e.g. leaves). They rely mainly on the turgidity of <span class="hi-blue">thin-walled cells</span> (e.g. pith, cortex) for support.

*Sufficient water supply*:
- Thin-walled cells gain water from xylem vessels by [[osmosis]] and becomes <span class="hi-blue">turgid</span>.
- The stem stands upright.

*Insufficient water supply*: (during hot & dry days) 
- <span class="hi-blue">Transpiration rate</span> becomes higher than <span class="hi-blue">water absorption rate</span>.
- Thin-walled cells lose water and becomes <span class="hi-blue">flaccid</span>.
- The stem is no longer supported, and bends.
- The plant <span class="hi-blue">wilts</span>.

# Rigidity
**Rigidity** is a means of mechanical support in <span class="hi-green">woody plants</span>. They rely mainly on the rigidity of <span class="hi-blue">thick-walled cells</span> of <span class="hi-blue">xylem vessels</span>.

*Properties of xylem vessels for support*:
- Cell walls of xylem vessels are <span class="hi-blue">thick and lignified</span>, making them <span class="hi-green">hard and rigid</span>.
- Supports plants even without sufficient water supply, as they consists of <span class="hi-green">dead cells</span>.

> [!note] Wood
> Wood contributes to the strength of woody stems.
> 
> It is formed when older xylem vessels are pushed towards the centre during growth, and develops into wood as they are further hardened with lignin, forming annual rings.
