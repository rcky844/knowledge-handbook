*Aim*: To measure the amount of water absorbed and lost

*Limitations*:
- A potometer can only measure the rate of water uptake.

*Assumptions*:
- Any loss of mass is due to transpiration.

*Precautions*:
- A leafy shoot should be <u>cut under water</u> to <span class="hi-green">prevent air bubbles</span> from entering the xylem vessels and <span class="hi-green">blocking water uptake</span>.
- All connections should be smeared with <span class="hi-blue">vaseline</span> to <u>prevent leakage of water</u>.
- An oil layer is added to prevent the evaporation of water, which can cause overestimation of water loss.

*Calculation*:
- Volume of water absorbed is equal to the drop in water level in the burette, while the volume of water loss by transpiration is the decrease in the weight of the whole set-up.
- The amount of water absorbed is slightly greater than the amount of water lost by the leafy shoot. This indicates that some water is retained in the shoot for [[photosynthesis]], growth and other metabolic activities.
