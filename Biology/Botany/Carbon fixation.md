**Carbon fixation** occurs in a cyclic series of reactions (called the **Calvin Cycle**) in the stroma of chloroplasts, in which carbon atoms from carbon dioxide are incorporated into organic molecules. They are also referred to as ‘dark reactions’ because they do not require light, depending on ATP and NADPH instead produced in the [[photochemical reactions]].

Overall, ATP and NADPH are used to convert carbon dioxide to glucose. ATP provides energy that drives several steps of the Calvin cycle, and NADPH provides hydrogen to reduce the 3-C compound to form glucose. Finally, the Calvin cycle regenerates ADP and NADP to be reused in [[photochemical reactions]].

##### Carbon dioxide fixation and the formation of a 3-C compound

- In the stroma, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combine with a five-carbon (5-C) compound (a carbon dioxide acceptor) to form two molecules of a 3-C compound.

##### Reduction of the 3-C compound and formation of glucose

- The 3-C compound is then reduced to a <u>3-C sugar</u> called triose phosphate. This reaction requires energy from ATP and hydrogen from NADPH, both of which came from [[photochemical reactions]].
- Triose phosphate is the primary product of the Calvin cycle, some of them combine in pairs to form [[Carbohydrates (Photosynthesis)#Glucose|glucose]] (6-C).

##### Regeneration of the carbon dioxide acceptor
![[photosynthesis_carbon_fix_s3.webp|450]]

- Most triose phosphate molecules are used to regenerate the 5-C carbon dioxide acceptor for the Calvin cycle to repeat.
- The regeneration process requires ATP from [[photochemical reactions]] to provide energy.
