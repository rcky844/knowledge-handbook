A **chromosome** is made up of DNA wrapped around special protein molecules called histone.
It is normally visible under a light microscope only during the metaphase of cell division.

#### Role in cell division
![[chromosome_cartoonish.webp|250]]

In [[interphase]], each chromosome is duplicated (DNA is replicated). When the cell is about to divide at the beginning of [[nuclear division]] (prophase), the [[Interphase#Under light microscope|chromatin]] coils tightly into a chromosome. Each [[chromosome]] is visible as a X-shaped structure made up of two chromatids joined together at the centromere. The joined copies are now referred to as sister chromatids (as they are identical copies of each other).

During cell division, genetic information is carried by DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) to be passed from a parent cell to the daughter cells.

#### Numbers of chromosomes
The number of chromosomes in a single cell varies from species to species. However, all body cells from a particular species have a fixed number of chromosomes.

- Cell or organism with two sets of chromosomes is described as diploid (2n).
  e.g. human somatic cells
- Cell with only one set of chromosomes is described as haploid (n).
  e.g. sex cells, gametes

#### Homologous chromosomes
A pair of **homologous chromosomes**, or **homologs**, is a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during fertilisation.

- **Parental chromosomes**: The set of chromosomes from <u>male</u> parent.
- **Maternal chromosomes**: The set of chromosomes from <u>female</u> parent.
