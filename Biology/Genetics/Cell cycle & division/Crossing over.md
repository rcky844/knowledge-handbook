**Crossing over** is a process when two non-sister chromatids of a homologous pair cross each other at certain points, exchanging corresponding segments. This may happen when homologous chromosomes pair up during [[Meiotic cell division#Prophase I|prophase I]].

This process brings about new genetic combinations in gametes.
