**Independent assortment**, or **random segregation**, describes the independent separation of genes during the development of gametes.

In [[Meiotic cell division#First meiotic cell division (meiosis I) homologous chromosomes separate|meiosis I]], the paired homologous chromosomes line up along the equatorial plane.
The arrangement of [[Chromosome|chromosomes]] in each homologous pair at the equatorial plane is random, and the two members of each pair separate independently of any other pair.
The gametes produced vary in their combinations of chromosomes. (2<sup>n</sup>)
