Infectious diseases can be transmitted from person to person. Some infectious diseases may even have more than one mode of transmission.

In this document, major methods of transmission are detailed with possible prevention methods.

#### Direct contact
Transmission may occur through direct physical contact (e.g. touching, kissing, sexual intercourse), or sharing of personal items (e.g. towels, combs, clothes). Pathogens may enter through wounds on the skin, or when rubbing our eyes or nose with hands that have contacted the pathogen.

##### Examples
- Athlete's foot
- Chickenpox
- Hand, foot and mouth disease
- STIs (e.g. genital herpes, Gonorrhea)

##### Prevention
- Avoid direct physical contact with infected persons. Wear protective gloves and clothing when taking care of infected persons.
- Do not share personal items (e.g. towels, combs or clothes).
- Maintain good personal hygiene (e.g. washing hands after contact with an infected person).


#### Droplets and air-borne transmission
When infected person talks, coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets of mucus and saliva containing pathogens are released into the air, with some landing on and contaminating nearby surfaces. Some pathogens transmitted may be so tiny that they can travel long distances and stay suspended in the air for a long time.

They enter another person's body when they reach the mucous membranes of the nose, eyes and mouth of another person.

##### Prevention
- Wearing a face mask if infected or when in close contact with infected persons.
- Cover the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and disinfecting the hands afterwards.
- Avoid going to crowded and poorly ventilated public areas when an air-borne disease is prevalent.
- Maintain good indoor ventilation so that droplets are blown away by fresh air.
- Frequently clean and disinfect surfaces which may be touched in public areas.
  (e.g. door handles, lift buttons, handrails, etc.)


#### Contaminated food and water
##### Examples
- Eggs, meat or other food products from an infected animal
- When handling food with unwashed hands (after going to the toilet) → Tapeworms!
- Draining sewage (may contain faeces) into water supply systems without proper treatment → Cholera!

##### Prevention
- Washing hands with liquid soap after going to the toilet and before handling food.
- Adopting food hygiene practices in food handling
  (e.g. use separate cooking utensils for handling raw and cooked food)
- Buying food from clean and reliable shops or markets.
- Cooking food and boil drinking water thoroughly, and at the right temperatures.
- Refrigerating food at the right temperature. Maintain the refrigerator at or below 4°C and the freezer at or below -18°C.
- Dispose of faeces and sewage only when treated properly.


#### Bodily fluids
Some pathogens are present in body fluids (e.g. blood, semen and vaginal secretions) of infected persons. They may enter the body of another person through wounds, by sharing of needles or syringes, or during sexual intercourse.

##### Examples
- HIV/AIDS
- Hepatitis B
- Syphilis

##### Prevention
- Wearing gloves when treating wounds or handling blood.
- Avoid sharing toothbrushes, scalpels and other objects that may be contaminated with blood.
- Practice safe sex and wear a condom during sexual contact.
- Screen blood before transfusion.
- Never share injection and needles.


#### By vectors
Vectors are organisms that carries pathogens from one host to another.

##### Examples
- **Cockroaches & houseflies**
  Feed on faeces in sewers or food waste, and their body parts may pick up the pathogens. If they land on or touch food items, the food become contaminated with pathogens.
  → Cholera!

- **Mosquitoes**
  It may bite an infected person and takes up the pathogens. When it bites a healthy person, the pathogens are transmitted to that person. Only female mosquitoes bite and suck blood from animals to obtain necessary proteins for their eggs, while male mosquitoes survive by feeding on nectar and fruit juices.
  → Malaria, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika fever!


##### Prevention
- **Do not leave food unattended**
  Place food in covered containers so that cockroaches and houseflies cannot reach the food.

- **Kill vectors**
  Spray pesticides or larvicidal oil around mosquito’s habitats.

- **Remove potential breeding grounds of vectors**
  Clear standing water, which is a common breeding site for mosquitoes.
  Remove potential exposed sources of food so cockroaches would not invade the home.

- **Take action to avoid mosquito bites**
  Wear light-coloured long-sleeved clothing, apply insect repellents and use mosquito nets or screens
