**Sickle-cell anaemia** is a genetic disorder of the blood. It is caused by a [[Mutations#Gene mutations|substitution of one base in the gene coding]] for a polypeptide chain in the [[Red blood cells|haemoglobin]].

The mutation alters the <span class="hi-green">conformation and properties of haemoglobin</span>. In conditions of low oxygen concentration, the abnormal haemoglobin molecules form <u>long fibres</u> within the red blood cells, causing them to <u>become sickle-shaped</u>.

*Problem*:
- **Lower oxygen carrying capacity**
  They do not carry oxygen as efficiently as normal red blood cells.

- **Red blood cells sticks together**
  The red bloods tend to <u>stick together</u>, <span class="hi-green">blocking blood vessels and prevent normal blood flow</span>, causing organ damage.

- **Shorter lifespan than normal red blood cells**
  The sickle-shaped cells are more likely to be damaged and have a <span class="hi-green">shorter lifespan</span> than normal red blood cells. The patients do not produce red blood cells fast enough to replace dead red blood cells, leading to <span class="hi-blue">anaemia</span>.

Individuals who are heterozygous have one allele for normal haemoglobin and one sickle-cell allele, their red blood cells are slightly fragile because 50% of the haemoglobin in the cells is abnormal. Although individuals with malaria is mildly anaemic, they are more resistance to malaria, which is caused by *[[Types of pathogens#Protists|Plasmodium]]*.

In areas where malaria is common (due to presence of mosquitoes), <span class="hi-green">heterozygous individuals have a selective advantage</span> over people with normal red blood cells.
