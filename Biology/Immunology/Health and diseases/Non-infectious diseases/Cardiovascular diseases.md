**Cardiovascular diseases** refer to two types of diseases:
- Heart diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease)
- Cerebrovascular diseases (e.g. stroke)

# Development
**Cardiovascular diseases** are caused by a build-up of <span class="hi-blue">plaque</span> in arteries. A plaque forms when <span class="hi-blue">cholesterol and other fatty substances</span> deposits on the inner wall of the artery. As it builds up and becomes larger in size, it <span class="hi-green">narrows the artery and hardens the arterial wall</span>.

If the plaque ruptures, a <u>blood clot</u> can form on its surface, <span class="hi-green">reducing blood flow</span> through the artery.

As the blood clot forms, one of the following complications may arise:
- **Coronary heart disease**: One or more coronary arteries is blocked or bursts, reducing blood flow to cardiac muscles, the cardiac muscle may die, resulting in a heart attack.
- **Stroke**: An artery in the brain is blocked or bursts. Blood supply to a part of the brain is reduced, and the brain cells nearby die due to insufficient oxygen supply.

# Risk factors
In the risk factors listed below, some cannot be avoided. However, risk factors related to behaviour and lifestyle choices are modifiable. Therefore, it is possible to adopt healthy lifestyles in order to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.

## Biological risk factors
### Ageing
- Ageing provides time for plaques to build up.
- They have also been exposed to other risk factors over time.

### Gender
- Men have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases compared to women of the same age.
- Woman's risk after menopause is similar to man.

### Family history
- Some genes are related to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- Individuals with a family history of cardiovascular diseases are more likely to develop these diseases.

## Behavioural risk factors
### Smoking
- **Nicotine**: Increases blood viscosity and the chance of forming blood clots, and causes blood vessels to constrict and raises heart rate, forcing the heart to work harder.
- **Carbon monoxide**: Binds to haemoglobin readily and reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, forcing the heart to work harder to supply enough oxygen for body tissues.
	- Increased workload of the heart leads to a higher risk of heart attack.
- *Prevention*: Quit smoking

### Unhealthy diet
- A diet high in saturated fat and trans fat raises the blood cholesterol level. Excess cholesterol slowly builds up in the inner walls of arteries and forms plaques as it circulates the blood.
- High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Eating foods with high salt content raises blood pressure.
- *Prevention*: A healthy lifestyle can be devised, see [[Balanced diet]].

### Physical inactivity
- People who are physically inactive or have a sedentary lifestyle are more likely to be overweight or obese.
- Overweight individuals are more likely to have high blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- Being overweight also makes the heart work harder, increasing the risk of heart attack.
- *Prevention*: Exercise regularly
  (e.g. doing at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity five times a week)

# Treatments
## Balloon angioplasty
![[balloon_angioplasty.webp|400]]
1. A <u>small tube with a tiny balloon</u> is inserted into the narrowed region of the artery.
2. The balloon is <span class="hi-green">inflated</span> and the plaque is <span class="hi-green">flattened</span>. The size of the lumen increases.
3. The balloon is <span class="hi-green">deflated</span> and withdrawn. The metal mash may be left in the artery to keep the artery open.

## Coronary bypass surgery
![[bypass_surgery.webp|380]]
- A short length of blood vessel is taken from another part of the body (usually the leg).
- The blood vessel is then grafted to connect the aorta and the coronary artery to <span class="hi-green">bypass the blockage</span>, creating an alternative pathway for blood to reach the cardiac muscle.
