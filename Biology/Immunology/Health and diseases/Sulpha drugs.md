**Sulpha drugs** are synthetic antibacterial drugs derived from sulphur-containing compounds called sulphonamides.

**Sulphonamides** are enzyme inhibitors to inhibit the synthesis of a metabolite (folic acid), which is necessary for cell division in bacteria, slowing down bacterial growth. However, they do not kill bacteria.

These drugs often caused allergies and have mostly been replaced by antibiotics, which are more effective and have fewer side effects.

#### Examples of usage
- In treating UTIs
- Preventing infections in patients with severe burns
