By the definition of the World Health Organisation (WHO):

> "A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease." â€” *Constitution of the World Health Organisation*, signed April 7, 1948

The definition dismantles a <span class="hi-blue">labelling effect</span> and addresses a common misconception regarding health where people with [[Diseases]] are labelled as unhealthy, especially those carrying an incurable [[Non-infectious diseases|chronic diseases]].

Therefore, there is no <u>"black-and-white"</u> definition of health, but multiple factors that contribute to health. These factors include:
1. **Physical well-being**
	- Proper body functions
	- Free from diseases and injuries

2. **Mental well-being**
	- Ability to cope with stress in life
	- Ability to work or study productively and realises his or her potential

3. **Social well-being**
	- Good inter-personal relationships
	- Respects and gets along well with others
