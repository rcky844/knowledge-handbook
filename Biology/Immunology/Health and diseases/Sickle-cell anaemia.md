**Sickle-cell anaemia** is a genetic disorder of the blood. It is caused by a [[Mutations#Gene mutations|substitution of one base in the gene coding]] for a polypeptide chain in the [[Red blood cells|haemoglobin]].

The mutation alters the conformation and properties of haemoglobin. In conditions of low oxygen concentration, the abnormal haemoglobin molecules form long fibres within the red blood cells. This causes the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped.

**Problem**:
- **Lower oxygen carrying capacity**
  They do not carry oxygen as efficiently as normal red blood cells.

- **Red blood cells sticks together**
  The red bloods tend to stick together, blocking blood vessels and prevent normal blood flow, causing organ damage.

- **Shorter lifespan than normal red blood cells**
  The sickle-shaped cells are more likely to be damaged and have a shorter lifespan than normal red blood cells. The patients do not produce red blood cells fast enough to replace dead red blood cells, leading to anaemia.
