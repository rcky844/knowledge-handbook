**Antibiotics** are chemicals produced by certain bacteria and fungi which can kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microorganisms. The first known antibiotic Penicillin was produced by fungus *Penicillium*, which was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928 and later isolated by other scientists to treat infections.

#### Actions of antibiotics
Antibiotics kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria by disrupting essential processes or structures. Their actions include:

1. **Inhibiting formation of bacterial cell walls**
   Bacterial cell walls may not form properly during cell division and becomes weakened.
   It eventually burst (lyse) due to the influx of water by [[osmosis]].

2. **Disruption of cell membrane functions**
   Antibiotics binds to or inserts into the bacterial membrane and cause permeabilization and depolarization. The interference with the membrane's integrity compromises bacterial structural stability and impairs vital functions, resulting in cell lysis.

3. **Inhibiting protein synthesis**
   Antibiotics bind to bacterial [[ribosomes]] and disrupts processes such as translation or transcription. Growth and repair may not occur, growth of bacteria is inhibited.

4. **Inhibiting synthesis of nucleic acids**
   Bacterial cells cannot reproduce, inhibiting the growth of bacteria.


#### Indiscriminate use of antibiotics
> **Indiscriminate use of antibiotics** without proper jurisdiction might create a <u>future threat for another pandemic due to antibiotic resistance</u>. According to WHO, antibiotics become less effective against different strains of bacteria. *(Daria S, Islam MR., 2022)*

##### Causes
- Antibiotics are <span style="color: lightgreen">wrongly prescribed to treat viral infections</span> (e.g. influenza).
- Patients prescribed antibiotics <span style="color: lightgreen">do not finish the whole course of antibiotics</span>.
- Antibiotics are added to animal feeds indiscriminately to prevent illnesses among livestock.

##### Consequences
###### Development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria
Indiscriminate usage of antibiotics has caused many antibiotics to become ineffective as it increases the chances for the development of antibiotic resistance.

**Process of developing antibiotic resistance**:
![[antibiotic_resistance_development.webp]]

Multidrug-resistant bacteria (dubbed 'superbugs') have become more common, especially at hospitals and clinics. Infections caused by these bacteria are often incurable by conventional antibiotics and are often life-threatening.

###### Antibiotics kill beneficial bacteria
The intestines of the human body hosts a large number of bacteria. Antibiotics may kill these bacteria. As a result, pathogenic bacteria will face less competition for resources, encouraging the growth of pathogenic bacteria so the disease may develop even faster. The removal of beneficial bacteria from the gut may also cause side effects, such as diarrhoea.

###### Development of allergies to antibiotics after prolonged usage
> Several studies have shown that the use of antibiotics early in life significantly increases the risk of asthma in children; and antibiotic overuse might be associated with increased risk of allergy-related disease. *(Chen YL, Sng WJ, Wang Y, Wang XY., 2019)*
