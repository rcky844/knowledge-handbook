*Pre-context: [[Blood glucose levels and regulation]]*

#### Symptoms and signs
- **Presence of glucose in urine**
  The blood glucose levels are so high that the [[kidneys]] fail to reabsorb all the glucose, and therefore excess glucose is excreted in urine.

- **Frequent urination**
  Body cells lose water to the blood by [[osmosis]], leading to an increase in blood volume and hence an increase in urine production.

> **Note**:
> Glucose is soluble in water and affects the water potential of the blood.
> ↪️ See also: [[Parameters of the internal environment#Glucose level in blood]]

- **Intense thirst**
  The decrease in water potential of the blood stimulates the 'thirst centre' in the brain, making the person thirsty.

#### Types of diabetes
- **Diabetes Type I** (insulin-dependent diabetes)
  The pancreas does not secrete enough insulin.

- **Diabetes Type II** (non-insulin-dependent diabetes)
  The body cells do not respond to insulin.

#### Comparison with normal people
![[diabetes_graphs.webp|500]]
As body cells do not take up excess glucose from the blood, the <u>blood glucose level of a diabetic may become abnormally high</u>, especially after a meal.

**Blood glucose level for a diabetic**:
- There is a <u>larger rise</u> (rises to a higher level) in the blood glucose level.
- The blood glucose level remains high for a <u>longer time</u>.

> **Note**:
> - The blood glucose level may fluctuate as the body tries to maintain a stable level by [[negative feedback system]].
> - The gradual decrease in blood glucose level is due to the lost of glucose in the urine.

**Blood insulin level for type I diabetes**:
- The blood insulin level is lower than a healthy person.
- Although there is an increase in the blood glucose level, the blood insulin level shows little change.

**Blood insulin level for type II diabetes**:
- The blood insulin level is higher than a healthy person.
- However, the blood glucose level will not fall even though there is a high insulin level, as the body cells do not respond to the insulin.

> **Note**:
> - Blood insulin level should lag behind the blood glucose level.

#### Care for diabetics
- They have to monitor their blood glucose levels (e.g. glucometer) at intervals throughout the day.
- They may need injections of insulin after meals to lower the blood glucose level.

> **Note**:
> Injection dose of insulin must be carefully controlled.
> - If too much insulin is injected, the blood glucose level may fall so low that body cells cannot obtain enough glucose for respiration and [[metabolism]] will slow down.

#### Dietary considerations for diabetics
Meals should be <u>high-fibre, low glycaemic index (GI) carbohydrates</u> and be <u>low in total saturated fats, added sugar and salt</u>.
- They can have frequent meals, but in small portions.
- They should avoid food which elevates blood glucose level in a short time.

##### Glycaemic index (GI)
The **glycemic index** is a number from 0 to 100 assigned to a food, with pure glucose arbitrarily given the value of 100, which represents the relative rise in the blood glucose level two hours after consuming that food.

> **Note**:
> - Low GI food will lead to small fluctuations in blood glucose level.
> - The chance of having too high of a blood glucose level is reduced.
