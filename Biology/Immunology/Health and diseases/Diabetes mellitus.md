*Pre-context: [[Blood glucose levels and regulation]]*

#### Symptoms and signs
- **Presence of glucose in urine**
  The blood glucose levels are so high that the [[kidneys]] fail to reabsorb all the glucose, and therefore excess glucose is excreted in urine.

- **Frequent urination**
  Body cells lose water to the blood by [[osmosis]], leading to an increase in blood volume and hence an increase in urine production.

> **Note**:
> Glucose is soluble in water and affects the water potential of the blood.
> ↪️ See also: [[Parameters of the internal environment#Glucose level in blood]]

- **Intense thirst**
  The decrease in water potential of the blood stimulates the 'thirst centre' in the brain, making the person thirsty.

#### Types of diabetes
- **Diabetes Type I** (insulin-dependent diabetes)
  The pancreas does not secrete enough insulin.

- **Diabetes Type II** (non-insulin-dependent diabetes)
  The body cells do not respond to insulin.

#### Comparison with normal people
![[diabetes_graphs.webp|500]]
As body cells do not take up excess glucose from the blood, the <u>blood glucose level of a diabetic may become abnormally high</u>, especially after a meal.

**Characteristics of the blood glucose level for a diabetic**:
- There is a <u>larger rise</u> in the blood glucose level.
- The blood glucose level remains high for a <u>longer time</u>.

> **Note**:
> - The blood glucose level may fluctuate as the body tries to maintain a stable level by [[negative feedback system]].
> - The gradual decrease in blood glucose level is due to the lost of glucose in the urine.

#### Care for diabetics
- They have to monitor their blood glucose levels (e.g. glucometer) at intervals throughout the day.
- They may need injections of insulin after meals to lower the blood glucose level.

> **Note**:
> Injection dose of insulin must be carefully controlled.
> - If too much insulin is injected, the blood glucose level may fall so low that body cells cannot obtain enough glucose for respiration and [[metabolism]] will slow down.
