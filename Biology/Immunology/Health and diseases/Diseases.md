**Diseases** are abnormal conditions that affect the body of an organism, indicated by <span class="hi-blue">signs and symptoms</span>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Signs</span> are objective evidences of the presence of a disease which can be <span class="hi-green">observed or measured</span> by the patient and other people. (e.g. fever and cough)
- <span class="hi-blue">Symptoms</span> are <span class="hi-green">sensations</span> or changes in body function experiences by the patient only. These changes are subjective. (e.g. headache)

# Types of diseases
- [[Infectious diseases]]
  Diseases that can be spread from one person to another, caused by <span class="hi-blue">pathogens</span> (disease-causing agents).

- [[Non-infectious diseases]]
  Diseases that cannot be spread from person to person, caused by biological factors (e.g. ageing and heredity), environmental factors and behavioural factors.

# Spread of diseases
- **Low income countries**: [[Infectious diseases]] (e.g. cholera) are widespread due to their crowded living conditions and poor hygiene.
- **High income countries**: [[Non-infectious diseases]] are on the rise.
- **Global warming**: Rise in global temperature.
  (e.g. Favours the reproduction of mosquitoes → More frequent outbreaks of malaria and dengue fever)
- **Globalisation**: People travel around the world more frequently, spreading around the world more rapidly.

# Prevention of diseases
## Personal health
- Adopting healthy lifestyles
- Maintaining good personal hygiene

↪ Reduces the chances of getting infectious and non-infectious diseases.
(e.g. cancer & heart diseases)

## Community health
1. *Water and food safety*
   Public services (e.g. WSD, FEHD) provides clean water and monitors food safety, protecting citizens from <span class="hi-blue">water-brone and food-brone diseases</span>.

2. *Environmental hygiene*
   Public services (e.g. DSD, FEHD) offers treatment to household sewage, cleansing services (e.g. street sweeping and waste collection) and pest control services (e.g. monitoring mosquito levels).

3. *Health and medical services*
	- **Medical treatment services**
	  (e.g. through out-patient clinics, specialist clinics, hospitals)
	- **Disease monitoring** (e.g. CHP)
	  Alerts the public of possible health risks and takes timely measures (e.g. quarantine) to control the spread of infectious diseases.
	- **Preventive services**
		- *Screening programmes*: Allows early detection of non-infectious diseases so they can be <span class="hi-green">treated before progression into later stages</span>, improving cure rates and reducing costs on medical care. (e.g. screening tests for cancer)
		- *Immunisation programme*: Prevents disease outbreaks by [[vaccination]] where individuals are made immune to a disease. If a large majority of population is immunised against a certain disease, the disease will not spread easily.
		- *Health education*: Talks, exhibitions and through mass media to raise awareness.
