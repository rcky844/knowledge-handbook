**Diseases** are abnormal conditions that affect the body of an organism, indicated by signs and symptoms.

**Signs** are objective evidences of the presence of a disease which can be observed or measured by the patient and other people. (e.g. fever and cough)

**Symptoms** are sensations or changes in body function experiences by the patient only. These changes are subjective. (e.g. headache)

#### Types of diseases

- [[Infectious diseases]]
  Diseases that can be spread from one person to another, caused by pathogens (disease-causing agents).
- [[Non-infectious diseases]]
  Diseases that cannot be spread from person to person, caused by biological factors (e.g. ageing and heredity), environmental factors and behavioural factors.

#### Spread of diseases
- **Low income countries**: [[Infectious diseases]] (e.g. cholera) are widespread. This is due to their crowded living conditions and poor hygiene.
- **High income countries**: [[Non-infectious diseases]] are on the rise.
- **Global warming**: Rise in global temperature.
  (e.g. Favour the reproduction of mosquitoes → More frequent outbreaks of malaria and dengue fever)
- **Globalisation**: People travel around the world more frequently, spreading around the world more rapidly.

#### Prevention of diseases
##### Personal health
- Adopting healthy lifestyles
- Maintaining good personal hygiene
Reduce the chances of getting infectious and non-infectious diseases. (e.g. cancer & heart diseases)

##### Community health
1. **Water and food safety**
   Public services (e.g. WSD, FEHD) provides clean water and monitors food safety, protecting citizens from water-brone and food-brone diseases.

2. **Environmental hygiene**
   Public services (e.g. DSD, FEHD) offers treatment to household sewage, cleansing services (e.g. street sweeping and waste collection) and pest control services (e.g. monitoring mosquito levels).

3. **Health and medical services**
	- **Medical treatment services**
	  (e.g. through out-patient clinics, specialist clinics, hospitals)
	- **Disease monitoring** (e.g. CHP)
	  Alerts the public of possible health risks and takes timely measures (e.g. quarantine) to control the spread of infectious diseases.
	- **Preventive services**
		- **Screening programmes**: Allows early detection of non-infectious diseases so they can be treated before progression into later stages, improving cure rates and reducing costs on medical care. (e.g. screening tests for cancer)
		- **Immunisation programme**: Prevents disease outbreaks by vaccination where individuals are made immune to a disease. If a large majority of population is immunised against a certain disease, the disease will not spread easily.
		- **Health education**: Talks, exhibitions and through mass media → Raises awareness.
