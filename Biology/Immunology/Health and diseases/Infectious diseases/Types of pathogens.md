# Viruses
**Viruses** are non-cellular entities and do not carry out metabolism, requiring host cells to reproduce.

![[viruses_structure.webp|500]]

They get into living host cells and take over its metabolism to <span class="hi-green">produce virus particles</span> through <u>interfering with cell functions</u> (e.g. synthesis of nucleic acids or proteins), and release them to <span class="hi-green">infect more cells</span> by <u>damaging its cell membrane</u>.

| Disease | Virus |
| :--: | :--: |
| Influenza (flu) | Influenza viruses |
| Hepatitis (liver inflammation) | Hepatitis viruses |
| Dengue fever | Dengue viruses |
| Human immunodeficiency<br>virus (HIV) | Acquired immunodeficiency<br>syndrome (AIDS) |
| Measles | Measles virus |
| Severe acute respiratory<br>syndrome (SARS) | SARS-associated coronavirus |

Outside a host, viruses cannot reproduce and eventually disintegrates. However, [[Transmission and prevention of infectious diseases#Droplets and air-borne transmission|some viruses remain viable for a long period of time in air]].

# Bacteria
**Bacteria** are prokaryotic, free-living organisms usually consisting of one cell.

![[bacteria_structure.webp|400]]

- Some types of bacteria form [[Mutualism|mutualistic]] or [[Commensalism|commensal]] relationships within the human body (e.g. in the human [[stomach]]).
- Some types of bacteria are <span class="hi-blue">pathogenic</span> and can cause diseases by production of <span class="hi-blue">enzymes or toxins</span> that damage cells or interfere with normal functions.

| Disease | Bacteria |
| :--: | :--: |
| Cholera (causes diarrhoea) | *Vibrio cholerae*<br>(produces toxins that irritate the intestines) |
| Tetanus (lockjaw) | *Clostridium tetani*<br>(produces toxins that causes muscle contractions) |
| Tuberculosis (white death) | *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*<br>(attacks the lung) |
| Gonorrhea | *Neisseria gonorrhea*<br>(UTIs / kidney infections / inflammation) |

# Protists
**Protists** are a type of eukaryotic organism, where a significant number of protists are pathogenic parasites that must infect other organisms to survive and propagate.

*Example*: Pathogenic genus of protist *Plasmodium* (causes Malaria)
- Upon entering the bloodstream, the protist invades and reproduces in liver cells, and then in <span class="hi-blue">red blood cells</span>.
- The red blood cells eventually burst, releasing a large number of mature parasites to infect other cells, while also secreting toxins that cause fever, sweating and shivering.
- The parasite is commonly [[Transmission and prevention of infectious diseases#By vectors|transmitted by mosquitoes]].

# Fungi
Pathogenic **fungi** can grow on surfaces of the human body, where it secretes digestive enzymes onto the human tissues and absorb digestive products for growth.

*Examples*:
- *Trichophyton rubrum* grow on skin and nails, causing athleteâ€™s foot and onychomycosis.
- *Candida albicans* infects the lining of the mouth, oseophagus and vagina, or even invade internal organs (e.g. lungs and brain) in persons with weakened immune systems.

# Prions
**Prions** are <span class="hi-green">misfolded proteins</span> of normal proteins found in the <span class="hi-blue">central nervous system</span> of mammals.
- They can trigger normal proteins in the brain to <span class="hi-green">fold abnormally</span>.
- As they accumulate, neurones are destroyed and leaves holes in the brain tissue, making it spongy, causing <u>terminal neurodegenerative diseases</u>.
