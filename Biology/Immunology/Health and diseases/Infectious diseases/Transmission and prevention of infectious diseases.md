# Direct contact
Transmission may occur through <span class="hi-green">direct physical contact</span> (e.g. touching, kissing, sexual intercourse), or <span class="hi-green">sharing of personal items</span> (e.g. towels, combs, clothes).

Pathogens may enter through <u>wounds on the skin</u>, or when <u>rubbing our eyes or nose with hands</u> that have contacted the pathogen.

## Examples
- Athlete's foot
- Chickenpox
- Hand, foot and mouth disease
- STIs (e.g. genital herpes, Gonorrhea)

## Prevention
- Avoid direct physical contact with infected persons. Wear <u>protective gloves</u> and <u>clothing</u> when taking care of infected persons.
- Do not share personal items (e.g. towels, combs or clothes).
- Maintain good personal hygiene (e.g. washing hands after contact with an infected person).

# Droplets and air-borne transmission
When infected person talks, coughs or sneezes, <span class="hi-green">tiny droplets of mucus and saliva</span> containing pathogens are released into the air, with some landing on and contaminating nearby surfaces. Some pathogens transmitted may be so tiny that they can travel long distances and stay suspended in the air for a long time.

They enter another person's body when they reach the <span class="hi-blue">mucus membranes</span> of the nose, eyes and mouth of another person.

## Prevention
- Wearing a <u>face mask</u> if infected or when in close contact with infected persons.
- Cover the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and disinfecting the hands afterwards.
- Avoid going to crowded and poorly ventilated public areas when an air-borne disease is prevalent.
- Maintain good <u>indoor ventilation</u> so that droplets are blown away by fresh air.
- Frequently <u>clean and disinfect surfaces</u> which may be touched in public areas.
  (e.g. door handles, lift buttons, handrails, etc.)

# Contaminated food and water
## Examples
- Eggs, meat or other food products from an infected animal
- When handling food with unwashed hands (after going to the toilet)
- Draining sewage (may contain faeces) into water supply systems without proper treatmentso

## Prevention
- Washing hands with <u>liquid soap</u> after going to the toilet and before handling food.
- Adopting food hygiene practices in food handling
  (e.g. use separate cooking utensils for handling raw and cooked food)
- Buying food from clean and reliable shops or markets.
- Cooking food and boil drinking water thoroughly, and at the right temperatures.
- Refrigerating food at the right temperature. Maintain the refrigerator at or below 4°C and the freezer at or below -18°C.
- Dispose of faeces and sewage only when treated properly.

# Bodily fluids
Some pathogens are present in body fluids (e.g. blood, semen and vaginal secretions) of infected persons. They may enter the body of another person through <u>wounds</u>, by sharing of <u>needles or syringes</u>, or during <u>sexual intercourse</u>.

## Examples
- HIV/AIDS
- Hepatitis B
- Syphilis

## Prevention
- Wearing <u>gloves</u> when treating wounds or handling blood.
- Avoid sharing toothbrushes, scalpels and other objects that may be contaminated with blood.
- Practice safe sex and wear a condom during sexual contact.
- Screen blood before transfusion.
- Never share injection and needles.

# By vectors
**Vectors** are organisms that <span class="hi-green">carries pathogens</span> from one host to another.

## Examples
- **Cockroaches & houseflies** (e.g. Cholera)
  Feed on faeces in sewers or food waste, and their body parts may pick up the pathogens. Food may become contaminated if they land on or touch food items.

- **Mosquitoes** (e.g. Malaria, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika fever)
  Bites infected persons and transfers their pathogens to a healthy person. Only female mosquitoes bite and suck blood from animals to obtain necessary proteins for their eggs, but male mosquitoes survive by feeding on nectar and fruit juices.

## Prevention
- **Do not leave food unattended**
  Place food in <u>covered containers</u> so that cockroaches and houseflies cannot reach the food.

- **Kill vectors**
  Spray <u>pesticides or larvicidal oil</u> around mosquito’s habitats.

- **Remove potential breeding grounds of vectors**
  Clear <u>standing water</u>, a common breeding site for mosquitoes, and remove potential <u>exposed sources of food</u> so cockroaches would not invade the home.

- **Take action to avoid mosquito bites**
  Wear light-coloured long-sleeved clothing, apply insect repellents and use mosquito nets or screens
