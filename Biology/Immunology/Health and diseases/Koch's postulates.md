The **Koch's postulates** are a set of criteria for determining whether a particular [[Types of pathogens|microorganism]] is the cause of a specific [[Infectious diseases|infectious disease]]. It was proposed by German doctor Robert Koch in 1882.

- **Postulate 1**:
  The suspected pathogen must be found in all animals suffering from the disease, but not in healthy animals.
  (confirmed by microscopic observations of samples from healthy and infected animals)

- **Postulate 2**:
  The pathogen must be isolated from the diseased animal and grown in pure culture.
  (streak agar plate with samples from diseased or healthy animal)

- **Postulate 3**:
  The cultured pathogen must cause the same disease when introduced into a healthy animal.
  (introduce the suspected pathogen into a healthy animal)

- **Postulate 4**:
  The same pathogen must be isolated from the infected animal.
  (take blood or tissue sample and observe under microscope and/or streak agar plates with it)
