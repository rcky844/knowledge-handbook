**Viruses** are non-cellular entities and do not carry out metabolism, requiring host cells to reproduce. They get into living cells and take over the cell's metabolism to product virus particles and release them to infect more cells.

Most viruses cause disease by interfering with cell functions (e.g. synthesis of nucleic acids or proteins), or by damaging the cell membrane of the host cell.

Below lists major examples of diseases and the viruses involved:
- **Influenza (flu)**: Influenza viruses
- **Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)**: Hepatitis viruses
- **Dengue fever**: Dengue viruses
- **Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)**: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
- **Measles**: Measles virus
- **Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)**: SARS-associated coronavirus

Outside a host, viruses cannot reproduce and eventually disintegrates. However, [[Transmission and prevention of infectious diseases#Droplets and air-borne transmission|some viruses remain viable for a long period of time in air]].


#### Bacteria
![[bacteria_structure.webp|400]]
**Bacteria** are [[Sub-cellular structures in cells#Comparing prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells|prokaryotic, free-living organisms]] usually consisting of one cell. Some types of bacteria form [[Mutualism|mutualistic]] or [[Commensalism|commensal]] relationships within the human body (e.g. in the human [[stomach]]), while some other types of bacteria are pathogenic and can cause diseases in the human body.

Pathogenic bacteria produce enzymes or toxins that can damage cells or interfere with normal functions.

Below lists major examples of diseases and the bacteria involved:
- **Cholera (causes diarrhoea)**: *Vibrio cholerae* (produces toxins that irritate the intestines)
- **Tetanus (lockjaw)**: *Clostridium tetani* (produces toxins that causes muscle contractions)
- **Tuberculosis (white death)**: *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (attacks the lung)
- **Gonorrhea**: *Neisseria gonorrhea* (UTIs / kidney infections / inflammation)


#### Protists
**Protists** are a type of eukaryotic organism. A significant number of protists are pathogenic parasites that must infect other organisms to survive and propagate. In this section, the pathogenic genus of protist *Plasmodium*, which causes the disease Malaria, will be detailed.

Upon entering the bloodstream, the protist invades and reproduces in liver cells, and then in red blood cells. The red blood cells eventually burst, releasing a large number of mature parasites to infect other cells. It also secretes toxins that cause fever, sweating and shivering. The parasite is commonly [[Transmission and prevention of infectious diseases#By vectors|transmitted by mosquitoes]].


#### Fungi
Some pathogenic **fungi** can grow on surfaces of the human body, where it secretes digestive enzymes onto the human tissues and absorb digestive products for growth.

Below lists major examples of pathogenic fungi:
- *Trichophyton rubrum* grow on skin and nails, causing athleteâ€™s foot and onychomycosis.
- *Candida albicans* infects the lining of the mouth, oseophagus and vagina. It may even invade internal organs (e.g. lungs and brain) in persons with weakened immune systems.


#### Prions
**Prions** are misfolded proteins of normal proteins found in the central nervous system of mammals. They can trigger normal proteins in the brain to fold abnormally. As they accumulate, neurones are destroyed and leaves holes in the brain tissue, making it spongy.

It can cause terminal neurodegenerative diseases. In cattle, it can cause mad cow disease.
Prions cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and are typically transmitted to humans by infected meat products. Prions may also form by genetic mutations.
