#### Principles of vaccination
Vaccines are introduced into the body for inducing immunity to a specific disease. They contain antigens which may come from one of the following sources:
- Live, weakened (or attenuated) pathogens
- Dead pathogens
- Parts of the pathogen (e.g. viral proteins)
- Inactivated toxins produced by pathogens

As vaccines do not contain <u>active pathogens</u>, they do not cause diseases.

The antigens present in a vaccine stimulate the body to produce a [[Primary and secondary response#Primary response|primary response]], and memory cells for that particular antigen are produced. When the memory cells encounter the same antigen from live pathogens in the future, they can produce a [[Primary and secondary response#Secondary response|secondary response]] quickly.
