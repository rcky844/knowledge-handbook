**Vaccines** are introduced into the body for <u>inducing immunity to a specific disease</u>. They contain antigens which may come from one of the following sources:
- Live, <span style="color: skyblue">weakened (or attenuated) pathogens</span>
- <span style="color: skyblue">Dead pathogens</span>
- Parts of the pathogen (e.g. viral proteins)
- Inactivated toxins produced by pathogens

As vaccines do not contain <u>active pathogens</u>, they do not cause diseases.

**Explanation**:
- <span style="color: violet">Antigens</span> present in a vaccine are <span style="color: lightgreen">recognized by lymphocytes</span> to produce a [[Primary and secondary response#Primary response|primary response]].
- <span style="color: violet">Memory cells</span> for that antigen are <span style="color: lightgreen">produced</span>.
- <span style="color: aqua">When the memory cells encounter the same antigens again, they will quickly produce a large amount of antibodies to destroy the pathogens.</span> ([[Primary and secondary response#Secondary response|secondary response]])

#### Mutation of pathogens
**Example**: HKCEE 2010 Paper 1 Q8(a)
Influenza viruses undergo mutation easily. Explain why this characteristic of viruses make control of influenza difficult.
- The virus will form a <span style="color: aqua"><u>new strain</u></span>.
- <span style="color: violet">Memory cells</span> developed previously <span style="color: lightgreen">become ineffective</span> against the new strain. /
  The <span style="color: skyblue">existing population</span> <span style="color: lightgreen">does not have immunity</span> against the new strain. /
  <span style="color: aqua">Existing vaccine becomes ineffective</span>.
