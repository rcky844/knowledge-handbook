**Chemical barriers** in body defence are body secretions that kill or slow down the growth of pathogens.

#### Sebum
- Oily secretions produced by sebaceous glands in the skin.
- Contains chemicals that kill certain pathogens.

#### Tears and saliva
- Secreted by tear glands and salivary glands respectively.
- Contain lysozyme, which can kill certain bacteria by catalysing the breakdown of bacterial cell walls.

#### Digestive juices
- Secreted by gastric glands in the stomach which contains strong hydrochloric acid.
- Strong acids kills most of the pathogens in food, except for spores form of bacteria.

#### Vaginal secretion
- Acidic secretion due to the presence of lactic acid.
- Slows down the growth of most pathogens.
