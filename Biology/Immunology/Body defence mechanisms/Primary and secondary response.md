*Pre-context: [[Lymphocytes]]*

In an immune response, memory cells are also produced for memorising the antigen, and are responsible for immunological memory.

#### Primary response
**Primary response** happens when an antigen enters the body for the first time.

- **Latent period** (before the rise of antibody levels): Longer
- **Rate of antibody production**: Slower
- **Level of antibodies**: Lower
- **Protection period**: Shorter

**Explanation**:
Only a few specific [[lymphocytes]] can recognise the antigen. It takes time for lymphocytes to come into contact with the antigen and become activated.

**Disease symptoms**: May appear
The pathogen has time to reproduce and cause harm.

> [!note]
> Once an infection has been fought off, the plasma cells and killer T cells die within a few weeks, while the memory cells formed in the primary response can live for years.

#### Secondary response
**Secondary response** happens when the same antigen enters the body again.

- **Latent period** (before the rise of antibody levels): Shorter
- **Rate of antibody production**: Faster
- **Level of antibodies**: Higher
- **Protection period**: Longer

**Explanation**:
Memory cells recognise the antigen more rapidly. They divide and differentiate quickly into large number of plasma cells, killer T cells and memory cells. The plasma cells produce a large number of antibodies and the killer T cells destroy the pathogens or infected cells directly.

**Disease symptoms**: May not appear
The pathogens are killed before they can reproduce and cause harm.

↪️ The individual is referred to as immune to the disease in a secondary response.
