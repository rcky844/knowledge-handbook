In an immune response, memory cells are also produced for memorising the antigen, and are responsible for immunological memory.

#### Primary response
**Primary response** happens when an antigen enters the body for the first time.

- **Latent period** (before the rise of antibody levels): Longer
- **Rate of antibody production**: Slower
- **Level of antibodies**: Lower
- **Protection period**: Short

This is because only a few specific lymphocytes can recognise the antigen. It takes time for lymphocytes to come into contact with the antigen and become activated.

Disease symptoms may appear as the pathogen has time to reproduce and cause harm. Once an infection has been fought off, the plasma cells and killer T cells die within a few weeks, while the memory cells formed in the primary response can live for years.

#### Secondary response
**Secondary response** happens when the same antigen enters the body again.

- **Latent period** (before the rise of antibody levels): Shorter
- **Rate of antibody production**: Faster
- **Level of antibodies**: Higher
- **Protection period**: Long

This is because memory cells recognise the antigen more rapidly. They divide and differentiate quickly into large number of plasma cells, killer T cells and memory cells. The plasma cells produce a large number of antibodies and the killer T cells destroy the pathogens or infected cells directly.

Disease symptoms may not appear because the pathogens are killed before they can reproduce and cause harm, rendering the individual immune to the disease.
