# Non-specific defence mechanisms
**Non-specific defence mechanisms** do not target any specific pathogen, and protects the body against all types of invading pathogens and other substances as the first line of defence.

1. [[Physical barriers]]
2. [[Chemical barriers]]
3. [[Blood clotting]]
4. [[Phagocytosis (body defence)|Phagocytosis]]
5. [[Inflammatory responses]]

# Specific defence mechanisms
When physical and chemical barriers fail to stop the entry of pathogens and other **non-specific defences** fail to kill the pathogens, the immune system takes over to produce an <span class="hi-blue">immune response</span>.

## Components
1. [[Antigens]]
2. [[Lymphocytes]]
3. [[Antibodies]]

## Responses
- [[Primary and secondary response]]
- [[Vaccination]]
- [[Active immunity & Passive immunity]]
