**Blood clotting** helps prevent the entry of pathogens through the wound, and prevents excessive bleeding.

# Process
1. [[Blood platelets]] are attracted to the wound by chemicals released from the vessel wall.
2. Chain reactions started by blood platelets and damaged cells releasing substances causes <span class="hi-blue">fibrinogen</span> (a soluble [[Blood#Composition of blood|plasma protein]]) to convert into <span class="hi-blue">fibrin</span>, an <span class="hi-green">insoluble thread-like protein fibre</span>.
3. Fibrin threads form a network to trap blood cells to form a blood clot.
