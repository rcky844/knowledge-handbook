**Physical barriers** in body defence provide protection against the entry of pathogens.

*Skin*:
- The outermost layer of the <span class="hi-orange">skin epidermis</span> is made up of <span class="hi-blue">dead cornified cells</span>, which forms a tough barrier that can keep out pathogens.
- It can also help regulate [[Parameters of the internal environment#Body temperature|body temperature]].

*Breathing system*: ([[Nostrils and nasal cavity|main article]])
- <span class="hi-blue">Nasal hairs</span> in the nasal cavity can <span class="hi-green">filter large dust particles</span> from incoming air to stop them from entering the respiratory tract.
- <span class="hi-blue">Epithelial cells</span> lining the respiratory tract are <span class="hi-green">closely-packed</span> which form a <span class="hi-orange">physical barrier</span> to prevent pathogens from entering body tissues.
- <span class="hi-blue">Mucus-secreting cells</span> also lining the respiratory tract produces mucus to <span class="hi-green">trap pathogens and dust particles</span> from the incoming air. The mucus is then swept by <span class="hi-blue">cilia</span> of ciliated epithelium for removal.
