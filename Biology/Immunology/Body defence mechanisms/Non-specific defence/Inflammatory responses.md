**Inflammatory responses** are initiated when the body is wounded or infected.

# Mechanism & Process
![[inflammatory_response_diagram.webp]]

The damaged tissue releases <span class="hi-blue">histamine</span>.
- Arterioles nearby undergo <span class="hi-blue">vasodilation</span> (dilate) so that <span class="hi-green">more blood flows to the damaged tissues</span>.
- <span class="hi-green">Permeability of capillary walls increases</span>, more phagocytes and blood plasma move out of capillaries and into tissue fluid to reach the damaged tissue.
- Phagocytes engulf pathogens and remove dead body cells, facilitating wound healing.
- More tissue fluid is formed at the would, which helps <span class="hi-green">dilute the toxins</span> released by pathogens and reduce tissue damage.

# Signs & symptoms of inflammation
- **Redness**
  Arterioles near the wound dilate, <span class="hi-green">increasing blood flow</span> to nearby tissues, making them red.

- **Heat**
  Increased blood flow <span class="hi-green">raises temperature</span> of the wound, so the wounded area feels hot.

- **Swelling**
  Permeability of capillary walls increases, allowing more blood plasma to escape to <span class="hi-green">form tissue fluid</span>. Excess tissue fluid accumulates at the wound and causes swelling.

- **Pain**
  Built-up tissue fluid <span class="hi-green">presses against</span> and stimulates <span class="hi-blue">pain receptors</span> in the skin, causing pain at the wound.

> [!note]
> Sometimes pus (yellowish fluid) forms at the wound, which contains dead phagocytes, the remains of pathogens and other dead cells.
