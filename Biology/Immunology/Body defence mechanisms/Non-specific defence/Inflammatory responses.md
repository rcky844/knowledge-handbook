**Inflammatory responses** are initiated when the body is wounded or infected.

# Mechanism & Process
![[inflammatory_response_diagram.webp]]

- The damaged tissue releases <span class="hi-blue">histamine</span>.
- Arterioles nearby <span class="hi-blue">vasodilate</span> so that <span class="hi-green">more blood flows to the damaged tissues</span>.
- <span class="hi-green">Permeability of capillary walls increases</span>, more <span class="hi-blue">phagocytes and blood plasma</span> move out of capillaries and into tissue fluid.
	- <span class="hi-green">More tissue fluid is formed at the would</span>, which helps <span class="hi-orange">dilute the toxins</span> released by pathogens and reduce tissue damage.
	- <span class="hi-orange">Phagocytes engulf pathogens</span> and remove dead body cells, facilitating wound healing.

# Signs & symptoms of inflammation
- **Redness**: Arterioles near the wound dilate, <span class="hi-green">increasing blood flow</span> to nearby tissues.
- **Heat**: Increased blood flow <span class="hi-green">raises temperature</span> of the wound.
- **Swelling**: <span class="hi-orange">Permeability of capillary walls increases</span>, allowing more blood plasma to escape to <span class="hi-green">form tissue fluid</span> and accumulate at the wound.
- **Pain**: Built-up tissue fluid <span class="hi-green">presses against</span> <span class="hi-blue">nerve endings</span> and stimulates <span class="hi-blue">pain receptors</span> in the skin.

> [!tip]
> Sometimes pus (yellowish fluid) forms at the wound, which contains dead phagocytes, the remains of pathogens and other dead cells.
