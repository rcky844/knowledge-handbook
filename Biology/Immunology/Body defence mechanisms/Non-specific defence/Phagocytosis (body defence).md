**Phagocytosis** is a mechanism to kill pathogens that passed different barriers and entered the body.

<span class="hi-blue">Phagocytes</span> (a type of white blood cell) move towards the pathogens to carry out [[phagocytosis]] to <span class="hi-green">engulf</span> the pathogens and <span class="hi-green">digest</span> them with [[enzymes]]. Some of these phagocytes can squeeze between the cells of capillary walls and enter the infected body tissues.

1. The phagocyte forms extensions (<span class="hi-blue">pseudopodia</span>) to engulf the pathogen in a <span class="hi-blue">vesicle</span>.
2. <span class="hi-blue">Lysosomes</span> fuse with the vesicle and release <span class="hi-blue">lysozyme</span> (enzyme) into it to digest the pathogen.
3. The digested pathogen is released.
