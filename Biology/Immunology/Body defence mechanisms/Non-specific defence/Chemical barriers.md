**Chemical barriers** in body defence are body secretions that kill or slow down the growth of pathogens.

# Sebum
- <u>Oily secretions</u> produced by <span class="hi-blue">sebaceous glands</span> in the skin.
- Contains chemicals that kill certain pathogens.

# Tears and saliva
- Secreted by <span class="hi-blue">tear glands</span> and <span class="hi-blue">salivary glands</span> respectively.
- Contain <span class="hi-blue">lysozyme</span>, which can kill certain bacteria by <span class="hi-green">catalysing the breakdown of bacterial cell walls</span>.

# Digestive juices
- Secreted by <span class="hi-blue">gastric glands</span> in the [[Stomach#Stomach wall|stomach]] which contains strong <span class="hi-blue">hydrochloric acid</span>.
- Strong acids kills most of the pathogens in food, except for spores form of bacteria.

# Vaginal secretion
- <span class="hi-green">Acidic</span> secretion due to the presence of <span class="hi-blue">lactic acid</span>.
