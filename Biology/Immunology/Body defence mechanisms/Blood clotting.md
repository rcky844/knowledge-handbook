**Blood clotting** as a body defence mechanism helps prevent the entry of pathogens through the wound, while preventing excessive bleeding.

#### Process
1. Blood platelets are attracted to the wound by chemicals released from the vessel wall.
2. Chain reactions started by blood platelets and damaged cells releasing substances <u>causes fibrinogen</u> (a soluble [[plasma protein]]) <u>to convert into fibrin, an insoluble thread-like protein fibre</u>.
3. Fibrin threads form a network to trap blood cells to form a blood clot.
