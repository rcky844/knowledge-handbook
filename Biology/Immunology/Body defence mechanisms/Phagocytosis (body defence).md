**Phagocytosis** is a mechanism as the line of defence when pathogens pass different barriers and enter the body.

Phagocytes (a type of white blood cell) move towards the pathogens to carry out [[Phagocytosis]] to engulf the pathogens and digest them with enzymes. Some of these phagocytes can squeeze between the cells of capillary walls and enter the infected body tissues.

#### Process

1. The phagocyte forms extensions (pseudopodia) to engulf the pathogen in a vesicle.
2. Lysosomes fuse with the vesicle and release lysozyme into it to digest the pathogen.
3. The digested pathogen is released.
