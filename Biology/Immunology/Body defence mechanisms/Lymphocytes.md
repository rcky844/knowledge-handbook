**Lymphocytes** are cells responsible for <span style="color: lightgreen">identifying foreign antigens</span> and producing an immune response.

**Storage**:
- After becoming mature, lymphocytes circulate in the <span style="color: violet">blood and lymph</span>, or are <span style="color: aqua">stored in lymph glands and other lymphatic organs</span>.

**Actions**:
- On the surfaces of lymphocytes, there are antigen receptors. They are all <span style="color: lightgreen">identical on a particular lymphocyte</span> and binds only to a specific [[antigens|antigen]].
- When an antigen of a pathogen binds to a lymphocyte with the matching receptor, it becomes <span style="color: aqua">activated</span> to produce an immune response.

> [!note]
> The wide diversity of antigen receptors on the large number of different lymphocytes allows the immune system to recognise many different antigens.

#### Types of lymphocytes
The diagram below shows the major types of lymphocytes:
![[lymphocytes_types.webp|500]]
- **B cells**: Produced and mature in the [[bone marrow]], mainly involved with [[Antibodies|antibody]] production.
- **T cells**: Produced in the bone marrow but mature in the [[thymus gland]], responsible for producing cell-mediated immune response (relies mainly on actions of white blood cells).

##### B cells
When a B cell becomes activated, it <u>divides repeatedly</u> to form many identical cells, and <u>differentiating</u> into two different types of cells:
- **Plasma cells**: Secrete [[antibodies]] into blood, tissue fluid and lymph to act against invading pathogens. Responsible for humoral immunity.
- **Memory B cells**: Memorise the pathogen, allows for a quicker immune response if the same antigen enters the body again.
##### T cells
There are three major types of T cells:
- **Helper T cells**: Help coordinate the immune response by  releasing chemicals called [[lymphokines]].
- **Killer T cells**: Bind to cells infected by pathogens or abnormal cells (e.g. cancer cells) and destroy them directly.
	- This is done by making holes in their cell membranes so the cell contents leak out.
- **Memory T cells**: Memorise the pathogen, allows for a quicker immune response if the same [[Antigens|antigen]] enters the body again.

#### Memorisation of antigens
Some of the lymphocytes produced includes memory cells. Below lists information related to their functionality.
