**Lymphocytes** are cells responsible for identifying foreign antigens and producing an immune response.

After becoming mature, lymphocytes circulate in the blood and lymph, or are stored in lymph glands and other lymphatic organs.

On the surfaces of lymphocytes, there are antigen receptors. They are all identical on a particular lymphocyte and binds only to a specific [[antigens]]. The wide diversity of antigen receptors on the large number of different lymphocytes allows the immune system to recognise many different antigens.

When an antigen of a pathogen binds to a lymphocyte with the matching receptor, it becomes activated to produce an immune response.

#### Types of lymphocytes
The diagram below shows the major types of lymphocytes:
![[lymphocytes_types.webp|450]]
- **B cells**: Produced and mature in the [[bone marrow]], mainly involved with [[Antibiodies|antibody]] production.
- **T cells**: Produced in the bone marrow but mature in the [[thymus gland]], responsible for producing cell-mediated immune response. (relies mainly on actions of white blood cells)

##### B cells
When a B cell becomes activated, it divides repeatedly to form many identical cells, and differentiating into two different types of cells:
- **Plasma cells**: Secrete [[antibodies]] into blood, tissue fluid and lymph to act against the invading pathogen. Responsible for humoral immunity.
- **Memory B cells**: Memorise the pathogen, allowing for a quicker immune response if the same antigen enters the body again.

##### T cells
There are three major types of T cells:
- **Helper T cells**: Helps coordinate the immune response. When it becomes activated, it releases chemicals called [[lymphokines]].
- **Killer T cells**: Bind to cells infected by pathogens or abnormal cells (e.g. cancer cells) and destroy them directly.
	- This is achieved by making holes in their cell membranes so the cell contents leak out.
- **Memory T cells**: Memorise the pathogen, allowing for a quicker immune response if the same [[Antigens|antigen]] enters the body again.

#### Memorisation of antigens
Some of the lymphocytes produced includes memory cells. Below lists information related to their functionality.
