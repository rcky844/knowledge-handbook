*Pre-context: [[Lymphocytes]]*

In an immune response, memory cells are also produced for memorising the antigen, and are responsible for immunological memory.

# Primary response
**Primary response** happens when an antigen enters the body for the <span class="hi-green">first time</span>.
- *Latent period* (before the rise of antibody levels): Longer
- *Rate of antibody production*: Slower
- *Peak level of antibodies*: Lower
- *Protection period*: Shorter

**Explanation**:
Only a few specific [[lymphocytes]] can recognise the <span class="hi-blue">antigen</span> (of a pathogen). It <u>takes time</u> for lymphocytes to come into contact with the antigen and become <span class="hi-green">activated</span>.

**Disease symptoms**: May appear
The pathogen has time to <span class="hi-green">reproduce</span> and cause harm.

> [!note]
> Once an infection has been fought off, the plasma cells and killer T cells die within a few weeks, while the memory cells formed in the primary response can live for years.

# Secondary response
*See also: [[Vaccination]]*

**Secondary response** happens when the <span class="hi-green"><u>same</u> antigen enters the body again</span>.
- *Latent period* (before the rise of antibody levels): Shorter
- *Rate of antibody production*: Faster
- *Peak level of antibodies*: Higher
- *Protection period*: Longer

**Explanation**:
- Memory cells can recognise the <span class="hi-blue">antigen</span> (of a pathogen) more rapidly.
- They <span class="hi-green">divide and differentiate quickly</span> into large numbers of plasma cells, killer T cells and memory cells.
- The plasma cells <span class="hi-green">produce a large number of antibodies</span> and the killer T cells destroy the pathogens or infected cells directly.

**Disease symptoms**: May not appear
The pathogens are killed before they can reproduce and cause harm.

â†ª The individual is referred to as immune to the disease in a secondary response.
