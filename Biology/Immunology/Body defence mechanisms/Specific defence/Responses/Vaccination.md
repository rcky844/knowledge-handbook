**Vaccines** are introduced into the body for <u>inducing immunity to a specific disease</u>. They contain antigens which may come from one of the following sources:
- Live, <span class="hi-blue">weakened</span> (or attenuated) pathogens
- <span class="hi-green">Dead pathogens</span>
- Parts of the pathogen (e.g. viral proteins)
- Inactivated toxins produced by pathogens

↪️ As vaccines do not contain <u>active pathogens</u>, they do not cause diseases.

*Explanation*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Antigens</span> present in a vaccine are <span class="hi-green">recognized by lymphocytes</span> to produce a [[Primary and secondary response#Primary response|primary response]].
- <span class="hi-blue">Memory cells</span> for that antigen are produced.
- When the memory cells encounter the same antigens again, they will quickly  <span class="hi-green">produce a large amount of antibodies</span> to destroy the pathogens. ([[Primary and secondary response#Secondary response|secondary response]])

# Mutation of pathogens
*Example*: Influenza viruses undergo mutation easily. Explain why this characteristic of viruses make control of influenza difficult.
- The virus will form a <span class="hi-green">new strain</span>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Memory cells</span> developed previously <span class="hi-green">become ineffective</span> against the new strain. /
  The <span class="hi-blue">existing population</span> <span class="hi-green">does not have immunity</span> against the new strain. /
  <span class="hi-green">Existing vaccine becomes ineffective</span>.
