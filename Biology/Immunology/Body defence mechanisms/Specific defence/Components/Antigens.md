- They are unique to the cell possessing them and act as <span class="hi-green">markers for cell recognition</span>.
- The immune system can distinguish between its <span class="hi-blue">own ('self') and foreign ('non-self') antigens</span>. It acts on cells with foreign antigens by triggering an immune response.
