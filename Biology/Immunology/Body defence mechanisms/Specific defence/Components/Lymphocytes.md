**Lymphocytes** are cells responsible for <span class="hi-green">identifying foreign antigens</span> and producing an immune response.

*Storage*:
- After becoming mature, lymphocytes circulate in the <span class="hi-blue">blood and lymph</span>, or are stored in <span class="hi-blue">lymph glands</span> and other lymphatic organs.

*Actions*:
- On the surfaces of lymphocytes, there are antigen receptors. They are all <span class="hi-green">identical on a particular lymphocyte</span> and binds only to a specific [[Antigens|antigen]].
- When an antigen of a pathogen binds to a lymphocyte with the matching receptor, it becomes <span class="hi-blue">activated</span> to produce an immune response.

> [!info]
> The wide diversity of antigen receptors on the large number of different lymphocytes allows the immune system to recognise many different antigens.

# Types of lymphocytes
![[lymphocytes_types.webp|500]]
- **B cells**: Produced and mature in the <span class="hi-blue">bone marrow</span>, mainly involved with [[Antibodies|antibody]] production.
- **T cells**: Produced in the bone marrow but mature in the <span class="hi-blue">thymus gland</span>, responsible for producing cell-mediated immune response (relies mainly on actions of white blood cells).

## B cells
When a B cell becomes activated, it <span class="hi-green">divides repeatedly</span> to form many identical cells, and <span class="hi-green">differentiating</span> into two different types of cells:
- **Plasma cells**: Secrete [[antibodies]] into blood, tissue fluid and lymph to act against invading pathogens. Responsible for <span class="hi-blue">humoral immunity</span>.
- **Memory B cells**: <span class="hi-green">Memorise</span> the pathogen, allows for a quicker immune response if the same antigen enters the body again.

## T cells
- **Helper T cells**: Help coordinate the immune response by releasing chemicals called [[lymphokines]].
- **Killer T cells**: Bind to cells infected by pathogens or abnormal cells (e.g. cancer cells) and <span class="hi-green">destroy them directly</span> by <u>making holes</u> in their cell membranes so the cell contents leak out.
- **Memory T cells**: <span class="hi-green">Memorise</span> the pathogen, allows for a quicker immune response if the same [[Antigens|antigen]] enters the body again.

![[Lymphokines]]

> [!warning]
> <span class="hi-blue">Phagocytes</span> are not a type of lymphocyte, as they can generate the same response to any pathogen (non-specific).

# Memorisation of antigens
Some of the lymphocytes produced includes memory cells, which relates to their functionality:
- [[Primary and secondary response]]
- [[Vaccination]]
