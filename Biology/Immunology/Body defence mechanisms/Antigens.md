**Antigens** are <u>proteins</u> present on surfaces of all cells.
- They are unique to the cell possessing them and act as <u>markers for cell recognition</u>.
- The immune system can <u>distinguish between its own ('self') and foreign ('non-self') antigens</u>. It acts on cells with foreign antigens by triggering an immune response.
