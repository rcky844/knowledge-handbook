#### Mechanisms and processes
**Inflammatory responses** are initiated when the body is wounded or infected. When tissues are damaged, they release chemicals called histamine. This cause nearby arterioles to dilate (vasodilation) so that more blood flows to the damaged tissues.

The chemicals also increase the permeability of capillary walls, allowing more phagocytes and blood plasma to reach the damaged tissue. As a result, more phagocytes and blood plasma move out of the capillaries and into the tissue fluid.

During the response, phagocytes engulf and remove dead body cells. This facilitates wound healing. Plus, more tissue fluid is formed at the would. This helps dilute the toxins released by pathogens and reduce tissue damage.

#### Signs and symptoms of inflammation

- **Redness**
  Arterioles near the wound dilate, increasing blood flow to nearby tissues, making them red.

- **Heat**
  Increased blood flow raises the temperature of the wound, so the wounded area feels hot.

- **Swelling**
  Permeability of capillary walls increases, allowing more blood plasma to escape to form tissue fluid. Excess tissue fluid accumulates at the wound and causes swelling.

- **Pain**
  Built-up tissue fluid presses against and stimulates pain receptors in the skin, causing pain at the wound.

â†³ Sometimes pus (yellowish fluid) forms at the wound, containing dead phagocytes, the remains of pathogens and other dead cells.
