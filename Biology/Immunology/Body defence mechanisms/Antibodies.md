**Antibodies** are Y-shaped protein molecules produced by [[Lymphocytes#B cells|plasma cells]]. They have two identical antigen-binding sites, allowing it to bind to an [[Antigens|antigen]] having a matching shape to form an antigen-antibody complex.

The production and action of antibodies are very specific. Only the matching type of antigen can stimulate a B cell to produce antibodies, and the antibody can only act against that particular type of antigen.

#### Action of antibodies
- Some antibodies bind to antigens of the pathogen and make holes on the pathogen surface, causing the pathogen to break apart. This process is called lysis.
- Some antibodies bind to antigens of the pathogen and help phagocytes detect the pathogen more easily, thus making phagocytosis easier.
- Some antibodies may cause pathogens to clump together. The clumping process is called agglutination. It prevents pathogens from reproducing or entering body cells. It also helps phagocytes engulf the pathogens.
- Some antibodies bind to the toxins secreted by pathogens and neutralise them, making them harmless. These antibodies are called antitoxins.
