**Antibodies** are Y-shaped protein molecules produced by [[Lymphocytes#B cells|plasma cells]]. They have <u>two identical antigen-binding sites</u>, which allows it to bind to an [[Antigens|antigen]] having a matching shape to form an antigen-antibody complex.

**Specificity in production and action**:
- Only the matching type of antigen can stimulate a B cell to produce antibodies.
- The antibody can only act against a particular type of antigen.

#### Examples for actions of antibodies
- **Making holes to cause lysis**
  The antibody bind to antigens of the pathogen and make holes on the pathogen surface, causing the pathogen to break apart.

- **Helping detection by phagocytes**
  The antibody bind to antigens of the pathogen and help phagocytes detect the pathogen more easily, thus making [[phagocytosis]] easier.

- **Clumping of pathogens**
  The antibody cause pathogens to clump together (agglutination). It prevents pathogens from reproducing or entering body cells, and helps phagocytes engulf the pathogens.

- **Neutralising toxins**
  The antibody (antitoxins) bind to the toxins secreted by pathogens and neutralise them, making them harmless.
