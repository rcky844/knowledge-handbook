- **Components**: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sometimes sulphur
- **Basic units**: [[amino acids]]

![[protein_folding.webp|300]]
- Varying sequences and length of dipeptides and polypeptides are formed when amino acids join together by condensation.
- The different sequences give rise to protein molecules with different shapes (conformation) to serve different functions.

### Functions & examples
- **Component of cellular structures**:
	- Proteins are important for the growth and repair of body tissues.
	- e.g. cytoplasm, cell membrane, etc.
- **Formation of some important molecules**:
	- **Haemoglobin**: Involved in the transport of oxygen in blood
	- **Enzymes**: Speed up chemical reactions in cells
	- **Antibodies**: Help protect our body against diseases
	- **Hormones**: Involved in regulating metabolic processes in the body
- **Source of energy**: Used when the human body is short of carbohydrates and lipids
