**Minerals** in organisms occur as inorganic ions dissolved in cytoplasm and body fluids. They are essential for regulating [[Metabolism]], but only needed in small amounts, as too much of it may affect water potential or disrupt neural signalling.

#### Nitrates (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>)
For making proteins, nucleic acids and chlorophyll.

#### Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>)
For making chlorophyll in plants.
A minor component of bones and teeth.

#### Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)
For muscle contractions and blood clotting.
A major component of bones, teeth and shells.

#### Iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>)
For making chlorophyll in plants.
For making haemoglobin in red blood cells.

#### Phosphorous / Phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>)
For making nucleic acids, cell membrane and ATP.

#### Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>)
Important for nerve impulse transmission and muscle contractions.

#### Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>)
Important for maintaining water balance and nerve impulse transmission.

#### Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>)
Important for maintaining water balance and nerve impulse transmission.
