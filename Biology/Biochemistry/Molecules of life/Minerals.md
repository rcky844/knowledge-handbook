**Minerals** in organisms occur as inorganic ions dissolved in cytoplasm and body fluids. They are essential for regulating [[Metabolism]], but only needed in small amounts, as too much of it may affect water potential or disrupt neural signalling.

#### Nitrates ($\ce{NO3-}$)
For making proteins, nucleic acids and chlorophyll.

#### Magnesium ($\ce{Mg^2+}$)
For making chlorophyll in plants.
A minor component of bones and teeth.

#### Calcium ($\ce{Ca^2+}$)
For muscle contractions and blood clotting.
A major component of bones, teeth and shells.

#### Iron ($\ce{Fe^3+}$)
For making chlorophyll in plants.
For making haemoglobin in red blood cells.

#### Phosphorous / Phosphate ($\ce{PO4^3-}$)
For making nucleic acids, cell membrane and ATP.

#### Potassium ($\ce{K+}$)
Important for nerve impulse transmission and muscle contractions.

#### Sodium ($\ce{Na+}$)
Important for maintaining water balance and nerve impulse transmission.

#### Chloride ($\ce{Cl-}$)
Important for maintaining water balance and nerve impulse transmission.
For making hydrochloric acid in gastric juice.
