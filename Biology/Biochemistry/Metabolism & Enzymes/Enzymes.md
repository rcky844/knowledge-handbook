**Enzymes** are proteins that act as biological <u>catalysts</u>. The substances they act on are referred to as **substrates**. They are often named by the reactions they catalyse or substrates, and ends with 'ase'.

To start any chemical reactions, sufficient activation energy must be supplied to the reactants. Enzymes provide a reaction pathway with lower activation energy in order to allow the reaction to occur and/or speed up the reaction. Note that the energy levels of both reactants and products are not changed by the action of enzymes.

#### Mechanism
![[enzymes_mechanism.webp|500]]
Each enzyme has an <u>active site</u> with a specific shape. When the substrate collide with the enzyme and binds to the active site of the enzyme, an <u>enzyme-substrate complex</u> is formed. This allows the reaction to proceed with lower activation energy.

Enzymes have specificity to the substrate it can act on. Only substrate with complementary shape can bind to the enzyme to form an enzyme-substrate complex. The 'lock-and-key' model is often used to explain the specificity of enzyme action.

The products are released once the reaction has completed, with the enzyme remaining unchanged and free to combine with other substrates.

#### Properties of enzymes
- Enzymes are protein molecules and remain active outside the body.
- Enzymes serve as biological catalysts to speed up (catalyse) [[Metabolism|metabolic reactions]] in organisms without being used up or chemically altered.
- Enzymes are reusable after the reactions and required in small amounts.
- Enzymes are highly specific in action, one type of enzyme catalyses only one type of reaction.
- Enzyme activity is affected by temperature and pH because they are proteins.
  It will undergo an irreversible process called denaturation if the conditions are not suitable.

#### Factors that affect enzymatic reactions
Note that rate of enzymatic reactions are measured by the rate at which substrates are used up or the rate at which products are formed. There are a few factors that could affect enzymatic reactions, they are listed below:
1. [[Effects of temperature on enzymatic reactions|Temperature]]
2. [[Effects of pH level on enzymatic reactions|pH level]]
3. [[Effects of inhibitors on enzymatic reactions|Presence of inhibitors]]
