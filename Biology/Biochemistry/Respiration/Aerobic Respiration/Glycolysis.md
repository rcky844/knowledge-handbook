**Glycolysis** is the first stage of respiration. It is a process to <u>break down glucose in the cytoplasm</u>.
- It <span style="color: lightgreen">does not require oxygen</span> and can occur in either aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
- It involves a series of <span style="color: lightgreen">enzyme-controlled</span> reactions and occurs in two phases.

**Overall products** (per glucose molecule):
- 2 pyruvate (3-C)
- Net gain of 2 ATP
- 2 NADH (reduced NAD)

1. **Phosphorylation**
   Glucose (6-C) is phosphorylated by 2 ATP to form fructose bisphosphate (6-C).
   ↪️ $\ce{Glucose + 2ATP → Fructose bisphosphate}$

> **Note**:
> ATP is used to make glucose more reactive (it is usually very stable) and to lower the activation energy of the reaction.

2. **Lysis**
   Fructose bisphosphate (6-C) splits into two molecules of triose phosphate (3-C).
   ↪️ $\ce{Fructose bisphosphate → 2 Triose phosphate}$

3. **Oxidation**
   Hydrogen is removed from each molecule of triose phosphate and transferred to coenzyme NAD to form 2 NADH (reduced NAD).
   ↪️ $\ce{4H + 2NAD → 2NADH + 2H+}$

4. **Dephosphorylation**
   Phosphates are transferred from the intermediate substrate molecules to form 4 ATP through substrate-linked phosphorylation.
   ↪️ $\ce{4P_i + 4ADP → 4ATP}$

5. **Production of pyruvate**
   End product of glycolysis which can be used in the next stage of respiration.
   ↪️ $\ce{2 Triose phosphate → 2 Pyruvate}$
