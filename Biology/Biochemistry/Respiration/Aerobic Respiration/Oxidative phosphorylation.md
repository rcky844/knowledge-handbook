**Oxidative phosphorylation** is the last stage of [[aerobic respiration]]. It takes place on the inner membrane of the [[mitochondria]] and uses the energy released by the oxidation of NADH and FADH to phosphorylate ADP to ATP.

1. **Regeneration of NAD and FAD**
	- NADH and FADH is oxidized to NAD and FAD respectively for usage in [[glycolysis]] and the [[Krebs cycle]].
	- Hydrogen atoms are donated by reduced NAD and FAD

2. **Electron transport and ATP formation**
	- Hydrogen atoms <u>split into protons</u> ($\ce{H+}$) <u>and electrons</u> ($\ce{e-}$).
	- The high energy electrons release energy as they move through the <span style="color: skyblue">electron transport chain</span>.
	- The released energy is used to transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane from the matrix into the intermembrane space.
	- A concentration gradient of protons is established between the intermembrane space and the matrix.
	- The protons return to the matrix via facilitated diffusion through the channel protein <span style="color: skyblue">ATP synthase</span>.
	- <u>The movement of protons down their concentration gradient provides energy for ATP synthesis.</u>

3. **Formation of water**
	- Oxygen is the <u>final electron acceptor</u> in the electron transport chain.
	- It combines with protons and electrons at the end of the electron transport chain from $\ce{NADH}$ and $\ce{FADH2}$ to form water.
	- Without oxygen, electron transport chain will stop functioning, and NAD and FAD cannot be regenerated. The [[link reaction]] and the [[Krebs cycle]] will stop.
