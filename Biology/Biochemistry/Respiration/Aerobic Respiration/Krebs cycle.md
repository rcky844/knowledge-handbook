The **Krebs cycle** is a cyclic series of enzyme-controlled reactions that take place in the mitochondrial matrix.

**Overall products** (per glucose molecule):
- Coenzyme A (CoA) → reused!
- 4 Carbon dioxide ($\ce{CO2}$)
- 6 Reduced NAD ($\ce{NADH}$)
- 2 Reduced FAD ($\ce{FADH2}$)
- 2 ATP

> **Note**:
> Spelling oxaloacetate or citrate is not required.

1. **Combination of acetyl-CoA with oxaloacetate (4-C)**
	- Acetyl CoA (2-C) enters the circular pathway via the [[link reaction]]. Oxaloacetate (4-C) accepts the 2-C acetyl fragment from acetyl-CoA to form citrate (6-C).
	- Coenzyme A is released for reuse in the [[link reaction]] to carry another acetyl group.

2. **Regeneration of oxaloacetate (4-C)**
   ![[oxaloacetate_regen.avif|450]]
	- **Decarboxylation of citrate**: Releasing $\ce{2CO2}$ as waste gas.
	- **Dehydrogenation of citrate**: Releasing $\ce{H}$ atoms that reduce coenzymes NAD and FAD.
	  ↪️ $\ce{8H + 3NAD + FAD → 3NADH + 3H+ + FADH2}$
	- **Substrate-level phosphorylation**: A phosphate is transferred from one of the intermediates to ADP, forming $\ce{1ATP}$.

> **Note**:
> The Kerbs cycle turns twice for each glucose molecule that undergoes [[glycolysis]].
