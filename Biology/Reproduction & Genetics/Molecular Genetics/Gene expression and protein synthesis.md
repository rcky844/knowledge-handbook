**Messenger RNA** (mRNA) carries the genetic code to the cytoplasm to direct [[Proteins|protein]] synthesis. The synthesis of proteins occurs in two stages.

# Stages of protein synthesis
1. [[Transcription]] - synthesis of mRNA in the nucleus.
2. [[Translation]] - synthesis of polypeptide (protein) in the cytoplasm.
