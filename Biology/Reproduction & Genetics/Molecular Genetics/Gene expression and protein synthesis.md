**Messenger RNA** (mRNA) carries the genetic code to the cytoplasm to direct [[Proteins|protein]] synthesis. The synthesis occurs in two stages.

#### Transcription
**Transcription** is the synthesis of mRNA using part of the nucleus DNA as a template.

##### Process
1. **Unwinding of DNA double helix**
	- An enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to a region of the DNA near the beginning of the gene to be transcribed.
	- The [[hydrogen bonds]] holding the two DNA strands of the double helix breaks. A section of the DNA double helix unwinds, exposing the bases of each DNA strand.
	- The **template strand** is the DNA strand that is transcribed. It acts as the template for synthesizing mRNA.
	- The **coding strand** is the DNA strand that is not transcribed.

2. **Pairing of RNA nucleotides with complementary bases**
	- RNA polymerase moves along the template strand, free RNA nucleotides pair with the exposed bases following the rules of [[DNA, chromosomes and genes|complementary base pairing]]. The enzyme catalyses the joining of adjacent RNA nucleotides to form an mRNA strand.
	- The base sequence of mRNA is complementary and identical to both the template strand and the coding strand, except it has the base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).

3. **Rewinding of DNA strands**
	- RNA polymerase separates from the DNA and releases the mRNA when it reaches ttWhen the end of the gene.
	- The DNA rewinds to reform the double helix.

Every triplet code on the DNA template strand is transcribed into a complementary sequence on the mRNA, called a codon.

The mRNA produced by transcription then leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores and enter the cytoplasm.

#### Translation
**Translation** leads to the synthesis of a polypeptide. It requires an amino acid sequence determined by the series of codons on the mRNA. This process occurs at [[ribosomes]] in the [[cytoplasm]].

##### Role of transfer RNA
**Transfer RNA (tRNA)** molecules act as carries of amino acids, bringing specific amino acids to the [[ribosomes]]. There are different tRNA molecules in the cytoplasm.

- At one end of the tRNA molecule is a binding site for a specific amino acid.
- At the other end of the tRNA molecule is a sequence of three unpaired bases (anticodon). It can pair with complementary mRNA codon.

##### Synthesizing a polypeptide
1. **Molecule of mRNA binds to ribosome**
	- A tRNA carrying the first amino acid binds to the start codon on the mRNA.
	- The tRNA has a complementary anticodon with the mRNA. //TODO chk

##### Assembling a protein
The polypeptide produced by translation then coils and folds to form a protein.
- Some proteins consists of more than one polypeptide.
- The amino acid sequence of each polypeptide determines the three-dimensional structure (conformation) of the protein molecule.

**Different fates of proteins**:
- Proteins made on free ribosomes in the cytoplasm stay in the cell and will be used within it. They may be enzymes that catalyse chemical reactions in the cell.
- Proteins made on ribosomes attach to the rough ER are either embedded in the cell membrane (e.g. channel proteins, carrier proteins and receptor proteins) or exported out of the cell (e.g. digestive enzymes, hormones and antibodies).
