**Genetic code** is a set of rules that determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein. It is stored in the sequence of nucleotide bases in the DNA of a gene.

It has the following features:
- **Triplet code**
  A sequence of <u>three consecutive bases</u> (triplet / codon) on a DNA strand <u>codes for one amino acid</u>.

- **Degenerate code**
  There are four types of bases in DNA, different combinations produce 64 triplet codes to specify 20 types of amino acids used to make proteins.
  The excessive number of triplet codes means that <u>certain triplet codes code for the same amino acids</u>.
	
- Some triplet codes serve as '**start signals**' or '**stop signals**' for protein synthesis.
- The code is read in a **continuous manner**. There is no break between codes.
- The code is **non-overlapping**. The adjacent triplet do not share a base.
- The code is **universal**. The <u>same triplet code</u> codes for the <u>same amino acid</u> in all species.
