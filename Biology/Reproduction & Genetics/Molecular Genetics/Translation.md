**Translation** leads to the <u>synthesis of a polypeptide (protein)</u>, with the amino acid sequence determined by the series of codons on the mRNA. This process occurs at [[Ribosomes]] in the cytoplasm.

> [!note]
> Production of proteins occurs in the cytoplasm.

#### Role of transfer RNA
**Transfer RNA (tRNA)** molecules are <u>carriers of amino acids</u>, bringing specific amino acids to the [[Ribosomes]]. There are different tRNA molecules in the cytoplasm.

- At one end of the tRNA molecule is a <u>binding site for a specific amino acid</u>.
- At the other end of the tRNA molecule is a <u>sequence of three unpaired bases (anticodon - complementary to codons of mRNA)</u>. It can pair with complementary mRNA codon.

> [!note]
> **tRNA** is a <u>single-stranded molecule</u> twisted into the shape of a clover leaf. <u>It is made in the nucleus through transcription and then moves out to the cytoplasm.</u>

#### Synthesis of a polypeptide
*Pre-context: [[Genetic code]]*
↪️ Some triplet codes serve as 'start signal' or 'stop signals' for protein synthesis.
(Start: AUG; End: UAA / UAG / UGA)

- First, molecule of mRNA binds to a [[Ribosomes|ribosome]]. tRNA in the cytoplasm complementary to the codons <u>binds to the start codon on the mRNA</u>, carrying amino acid.
- Then, another tRNA carrying another amino acid binds to the next codon with its complementary anticodon. The <span style="color: skyblue">amino acids</span> are joined together by <span style="color: lightgreen">peptide bonds</span>.
- The process repeats, the ribosome moving one codon further along the mRNA. The proceeding tRNAs will be <u>released to pick up another amino acid</u>.
- The ribosome continue to move until it reaches a <u>stop codon</u> on the mRNA. The mRNA and the polypeptide will be released, translation is complete.

> [!note]
> - [[Ribosomes]] provides <u>two sites (codons) for amino acids</u>. Therefore, a tRNA will separate from the mRNA when another codon is to be translated and there are not enough sites for binding tRNA.
> - There is <u>no corresponding tRNA for the stop codon</u>.

#### Assembling a protein
The polypeptide produced by translation then <u>coils</u> and <u>folds</u> to form a protein.
- <u>Some proteins consists of more than one polypeptide.</u>
- The <u>amino acid sequence</u> of each polypeptide determines the <u>three-dimensional structure (conformation)</u> of the protein molecule.

**Different fates of proteins**:
- Proteins made on **free ribosomes** in the cytoplasm <u>stay in the cell</u> and will be used within it (e.g. enzymes).
- Proteins made on **ribosomes attach to the rough ER** are either <u>embedded in the cell membrane</u> (e.g. channel proteins, carrier proteins and receptor proteins) or <u>exported out of the cell</u> (e.g. digestive enzymes, hormones and antibodies).
