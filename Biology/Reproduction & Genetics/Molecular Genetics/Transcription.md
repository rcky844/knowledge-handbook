**Transcription** is the <u>synthesis of mRNA</u> using part of the nucleus DNA as a template.

![[dna_strands.webp|500]]
- **Template strand**: The DNA strand to be transcribed.
- **Coding strand**: The DNA strand that is not transcribed, it is identical to the mRNA.

#### Process
1. **Unwinding of the double helix of DNA**
	- The <span style="color:skyblue">RNA polymerase</span> binds to a region of the DNA near the <u>beginning of the gene</u>.
	- The [[hydrogen bonds]] between the nitrogenous bases of the two DNA strands of the double helix <u>breaks</u>.
	- A section of the DNA double helix <u>unwinds</u>.

2. **Pairing of free and complementary RNA nucleotides**
	- The RNA polymerase makes use of one DNA strand as a <u>template (the template strand)</u>.
	- Exposed nitrogenous bases of the DNA attract and form [[hydrogen bonds]] with their <span style="color: lightgreen">complementary and free</span> <span style="color: skyblue">RNA nucleotides</span> in the <u>presence of RNA polymerase</u>. (see [[Genes|complementary base pairing]])
	- The RNA polymerase moves along the template strand. The process is <u>repeated</u> until the it <u>reaches the end of the gene</u>. A long messenger RNA is formed.

> [!note]
> The base sequence of mRNA is <u>identical to the coding strand</u> and complementary to the template strand, except it has the <u>base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T)</u>.

3. **Rewinding of DNA strands**
	- The RNA polymerase <u>separates from the DNA and releases the mRNA</u>.
	- The mRNA produced then <u>leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores</u> and enters the <u>cytoplasm</u>. It then rests on a [[Ribosomes|ribosome]] (free or ER-bounded) for translation.
	- The <u>DNA rewinds</u> to reform a double helix.
