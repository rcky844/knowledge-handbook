**Cytokinesis** is the process by which the cytoplasm divides into two equal halves to form two daughter cells.

#### In animal cells

The cell membrane around the middle of the dividing cells move inwards, constricting to form a cleavage furrow, which deepens until the parent cell separates to form two daughter cells.

#### In plant cells

A cell plate is formed midway between the two daughter nuclei, growing inwards and dividing the cytoplasm into two halves to form two daughter cells.
