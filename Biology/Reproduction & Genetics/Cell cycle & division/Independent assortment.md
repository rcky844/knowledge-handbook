**Independent assortment**, or **random segregation**, describes the independent separation of genes during the development of gametes in [[Meiotic cell division#First meiotic cell division (meiosis I) homologous chromosomes separate|meiosis I]]. The gametes produced vary in their combinations of chromosomes. ($2^n$)

**Process**:
- The paired homologous chromosomes line up along the equatorial plane.
- The arrangement of [[chromosomes]] in each homologous pair at the equatorial plane is random.
- <span class="hi-green"><u>The two members of each pair of homologous chromosomes are separated independently.</u></span>
