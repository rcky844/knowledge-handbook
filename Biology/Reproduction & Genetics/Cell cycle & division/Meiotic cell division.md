**Meiotic cell division** involves meiosis (division of the nucleus) and [[cytokinesis]] (division of the cytoplasm) to form <span class="hi-green">four genetically different, haploid daughter cells</span>. This occurs in <span class="hi-green">gamete-producing cells in reproductive organs</span>.

# Stages of meiosis
## First meiotic cell division (meiosis I): homologous chromosomes separate
### Prophase I
![[meiosis_prophase_i.webp|300]]
- Replicated DNA coils tightly into chromosomes.
  Each [[Chromosomes|chromosome]] is visible as two sister chromatids.
- <span class="hi-blue">Homologous chromosome</span> pair up.
- The <span class="hi-blue">chromatids</span> of the homologous pair may exchange segments with each other by [[crossing over]].
- The <span class="hi-blue">nuclear membrane</span> breaks down.
- <span class="hi-blue">Spindle fibres</span> start to form.

### Metaphase I
![[meiosis_metaphase_i.webp|300]]
- <span class="hi-blue">Homologous pairs</span> line up along the equatorial plane.
- The <span class="hi-blue">spindle fibres</span> attach to the chromosomes at the centromeres.

### Anaphase I
![[meiosis_anaphase_i.webp|300]]
- The <span class="hi-blue">spindle fibres</span> shorten and pull the two chromosomes of each homologous pair apart to opposite poles of the cell.

### Telophase I
![[meiosis_telophase_i.webp|300]]
- The <span class="hi-blue">spindle fibres</span> break down.
- A <span class="hi-blue">nuclear membrane</span> forms around each group of chromosomes. This is followed by [[cytokinesis]], forming <u>two haploid daughter cells</u>.
	- In some organisms, the nuclear membrane re-forms and the chromosomes decondense, although in others, this step is skipped since cells will soon go through another round of division in meiosis II.

## Second meiotic cell division (meiosis II): sister chromatids separate
### Prophase II
![[meiosis_prophase_ii.webp|300]]
- The <span class="hi-blue">nuclear membrane</span> break down again.
- <span class="hi-blue">Spindle fibres</span> start to form.

### Metaphase II
![[meiosis_metaphase_ii.webp|300]]
- The [[chromosomes]] line up along the equatorial plane.
- The <span class="hi-blue">spindle fibres</span> attach to the chromosome at the centromeres.

### Anaphase II
![[meiosis_anaphase_ii.webp|300]]
- The <span class="hi-blue">spindle fibres</span> shorten and pull the sister chromatids of each [[Chromosomes|chromosome]] apart, moving them towards opposite poles of the cell.
- The separated chromatids are now called <span class="hi-blue">daughter chromosomes</span>.

### Telophase II
![[meiosis_telophase_ii.webp|300]]
- The <span class="hi-blue">spindle fibres</span> break down.
- A <span class="hi-blue">nuclear membrane</span> forms around each group of daughter chromosomes. This is followed by [[cytokinesis]], four haploid daughter cells are formed.
	- Each cell contains one member of each homologous pair and only half the chromosomes of the parent cell and are genetically different.
- The [[chromosomes]] loosen to become <span class="hi-blue">chromatin</span> again.

# Significance
1. [[Sexual reproduction]]
   - Meiotic cell division forms haploid gametes for sexual reproduction.
   - When a male gamete and female gamete fuse at fertilisation to form a zygote, the diploid number (2n) of chromosome is restored. This keeps the chromosome number of a species constant from generation to generation.

2. **Genetic variation (speciation)**
   Meiotic cell division creates very large numbers of genetic variation among the gametes. Some offspring may have characteristics that enable them to survive environmental changes better. This increases the chance of survival of the species.
   
   Below are a few possible explanations:
   - [[Independent assortment]] (or random segregation)
   - [[Crossing over]]
   - Random fusion of gametes at fertilisation

# Non-disjunction
## Anaphase I
![[nondisjunction_i.webp|400]]
- Half of the gametes have both members of the homologous pair.
- Half of the gametes have no members of the homologous pair.

## Anaphase II
![[nondisjunction_ii.webp|400]]
- Half of the gametes have haploid numbers of chromosomes. (normal)
- Half of the gametes have both members of the homologous pair.
