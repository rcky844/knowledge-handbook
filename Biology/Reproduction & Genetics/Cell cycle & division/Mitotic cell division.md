**Mitotic cell division** involves mitosis (division of the nucleus) and [[cytokinesis]] (division of the cytoplasm) to form two daughter cells. Each daughter cells are <span class="hi-green">genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell</span>, as they <span class="hi-green">receive a copy of every chromosome of the parent cell</span>.

# Stages of mitosis
## Prophase
![[mitosis_prophase.webp|300]]
- Replicated DNA coils up tightly into chromosomes.
  Each [[Chromosomes|chromosome]] is visible as two sister chromatids attached at the centromere.
- The <span class="hi-blue">nuclear membrane</span> breaks down.
- <span class="hi-blue">Spindle fibres</span> start to form.

## Metaphase
![[mitosis_metaphase.webp|300]]
- The chromosomes line up along the <span class="hi-blue">equatorial plane</span>.
- The <span class="hi-blue">spindle fibres</span> attach the chromosomes at the centromeres.

## Anaphase
![[mitosis_anaphase.webp|300]]
- The <span class="hi-blue">spindle fibres</span> shorten and pull the sister chromatids of each chromosome apart, moving them towards opposite poles of the cell.
- The separated chromatids are now called <span class="hi-blue"><u>daughter chromosomes</u></span>.

## Telophase
![[mitosis_telophase.webp|300]]
- The <span class="hi-blue">spindle fibres</span> break down.
- The <span class="hi-blue">chromosomes</span> loosen (decondense) to become chromatin again.
- A <span class="hi-blue">nuclear membrane</span> forms around each group of daughter chromosomes. This is followed by [[cytokinesis]], forming two diploid daughter cells.

# Significance
The two daughter cells formed by mitotic cell division are genetically identical to the parent cell and have the <u>same function</u>. The following is a list of significant reasons for this:

1. **Growth**
	- *Significance*: Provides new cells for growth in multicellular organisms.
	- *Occurrence*: May occur over the entire body (in animals), or be limited to certain regions (meristems in plants).

2. **Repair**
	- *Significance*: Provides new cells to replace dead or damaged cells in multicellular organisms.
	- *Occurrence*: Happens more frequently in some body parts (e.g. in the skin and the lining of the intestines) for tissue repair.

3. **[[Asexual reproduction]]**
	- *Description*: Involves no fusion of gametes
	- *Significance*: Offspring produced are genetically identical to their parents and to each other.
	- *Occurrence*: In specific organisms (e.g. *Amoeba* & some plants)

# Frequency of mitotic cell division
It depends on the type of cell, some examples are listed below:
- Brain cells and cardiac muscle cells do not divide.
- Bone marrow cells divide continuously.
