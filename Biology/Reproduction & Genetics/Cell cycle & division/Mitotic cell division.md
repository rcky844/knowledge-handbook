**Mitotic cell division** involves mitosis (division of the nucleus) and [[cytokinesis]] (division of the cytoplasm) to form two daughter cells. Each daughter cells are <u>genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell</u>, as they <u>receive a copy of every chromosome of the parent cell</u>.

#### Stages of mitosis
##### Prophase
![[mitosis_prophase.webp|300]]
- Replicated DNA coils up tightly into chromosomes.
  Each [[Chromosomes|chromosome]] is visible as two sister chromatids attached at the centromere.
- The **nuclear membrane** breaks down.
- **Spindle fibres** start to form.

##### Metaphase

- The chromosomes line up along the **equatorial plane**.
- The **spindle fibres** attach the chromosomes at the centromeres.

##### Anaphase
![[mitosis_anaphase.webp|300]]
- The **spindle fibres** shorten and pull the sister chromatids of each chromosome apart, moving them towards opposite poles of the cell.
- The separated chromatids are now called <u><i>daughter chromosomes</i></u>.

##### Telophase
![[mitosis_telophase.webp|300]]
- The **spindle fibres** break down.
- The **chromosomes** loosen (decondense) to become chromatin again.
- A **nuclear membrane** forms around each group of daughter chromosomes. This is followed by [[cytokinesis]], forming two diploid daughter cells.

#### Significance
The two daughter cells formed by mitotic cell division are genetically identical to the parent cell and have the <u>same function</u>. The following is a list of significant reasons for this:

1. **Growth**
	- **Significance**: Provides new cells for growth in multicellular organisms.
	- **Occurrence**: May occur over the entire body (in animals), or be limited to certain regions (meristems in plants).

2. **Repair**
	- **Significance**: Provides new cells to replace dead or damaged cells in multicellular organisms.
	- **Occurrence**: Happens more frequently in some body parts (e.g. in the skin and the lining of the intestines) for tissue repair.

3. **[[Asexual reproduction]]**
	- **Description**: Involves no fusion of gametes
	- **Significance**: Offspring produced are genetically identical to their parents and to each other.
	- **Occurrence**: In specific organisms (e.g. *Amoeba* & some plants)

#### Frequency of mitotic cell division
It depends on the type of cell, some examples are listed below:
- Brain cells and cardiac muscle cells do not divide.
- Bone marrow cells divide continuously.
