**Interphase** is a period of active growth <u>between two successive cell division</u>, where cells carry out intense metabolic activities to prepare for the next cell division.

The metabolic activities include:
- Synthesis of proteins
- Synthesis of new organelles
- Replication of DNA (duplication of chromosomes)

By the end of interphase, the cell has doubled (2x) its amount of <u>DNA</u>, and is large enough to divide.

#### Under light microscope
During this stage when the cell is not dividing, the chromosomes cannot be seen with a light microscope because they appear as <u>long and fine threads of chromatin</u>.
