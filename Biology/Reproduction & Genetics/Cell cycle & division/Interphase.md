**Interphase** is a period of active growth <span class="hi-green">between two successive cell division</span>, where cells carry out intense metabolic activities to prepare for the next cell division.

*Metabolic activities*:
- Synthesis of proteins
- Synthesis of new organelles
- [[DNA replication|Replication of DNA]] (duplication of [[chromosomes]])

By the end of interphase, the cell has <span class="hi-green">doubled (2x)</span> its amount of <u>DNA</u>, and is large enough to divide.

<hr>

# Under light microscope
During this stage when the cell is not dividing, the chromosomes cannot be seen with a light microscope because they appear as <u>long and fine threads of chromatin</u>.
