# Sex determination
**Sex chromosomes** are chromosomes that control the inheritance of sex and certain characteristics of the body.
- Females have two X chromosomes ($XX$), while males have one X chromosomes and one Y chromosomes ($XY$).
- Certain genes present in sex chromosomes (usually the X chromosome, as it is much larger than the Y chromosome, and thus carries more genes) can cause the inheritance of sex-linked traits.

> [!note]
> The other 22 pairs of chromosomes are referred to as <span class="hi-blue">autosomes</span>.

In meiosis, all ova receive an X chromosome. However, half of the sperms receive an X chromosome and the other half receive a Y chromosome.

Since the two types of sperms are produced in equal proportions and fertilization is a random process, there is an equal chance ($1\over2$ or $50\%$) of having a boy or a girl at each birth.

# Sex-linked inheritance
Generally, sex-linked inheritances are X-linked and recessive in nature.

## Common genetic disorders
- **Red-green color blindness**
  X-linked genetic disorder caused by a recessive allele on the X chromosome. Certain cone cells in the retina are absent or defective.

- **Haemophilia**
  Many possible causes. One of which is the deficiency of blood platelets, where people are unable to form blood clots normally (blood coagulation / blood clotting).

## Representing genes
*Key*:
$R$: dominant allele for normal color vision
$r$: recessive allele for red-green color blindness

| Genotype  |          Phenotype          |
| :-------: | :-------------------------: |
| $X^R X^R$ |        Normal female        |
| $X^R X^r$ | Normal (**carrier**) female |
| $X^r X^r$ |         Sick female         |
|  $X^R Y$  |         Normal male         |
|  $X^r Y$  |          Sick male          |
- Males have only one X chromosome, and if their X chromosome carries the recessive allele, they will suffer from the disorder.
  ↪️ <u>X-linked recessive inheritance is more common in males than females.</u>

# ABO blood groups
This is an example of <span class="hi-green">multiple alleles / co-dominance</span>.

| Allele | Description |
| :--: | :--: |
| $I^A$ / $A$ | Causes the production of antigen A on the surface of red blood cells. |
| $I^B$ / $B$ | Causes the production of antigen B on the surface of red blood cells. |
| $i$ / $O$ | Causes no production of antigen |
- $I^A$ and $I^B$ are <span class="hi-green">co-dominant (equally dominant)</span> alleles, while $i$ is a <span class="hi-green">recessive</span> allele.

| Blood group | Antigen on RBC | Antibody in plasma | Genotype |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| A | Antigen A | Anti-B antibody | $I^A I^A$ or $I^A i$<br>$AA$ or $AO$ |
| B | Antigen B | Anti-A antibody | $I^B I^B$ or $I^B i$<br>$BB$ or $BO$ |
| AB | Antigen A and Antigen B | None | $I^A I^B$ / $AB$ |
| O | No antigen | Anti-A and anti-B antibodies | $ii$ / $OO$ |

## Blood transfusion
If blood with incompatible blood groups were transfused into the patient, the antibodies will attach to the antigens of the red blood cell's surface, causing <span class="hi-blue">agglutination / clumping of red blood cells</span>.

| Blood group / Receive & Donate | A | B | AB | O |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Receive | A, O | B, O | A, B, AB, O | O |
| Donate | A, AB | B, AB | AB | A, B, AB, O |
- People with **blood group AB** is a <span class="hi-green">universal recipient</span>, as they <u>do not have antibodies against antigens A or B</u>.
- People with **blood group O** is a <span class="hi-green">universal donor</span>, as they <u>do not have antigen A or B on their red blood cells</u>.
