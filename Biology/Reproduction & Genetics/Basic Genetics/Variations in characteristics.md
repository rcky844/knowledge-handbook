**Variations** are <span style="color: lightgreen">differences in characteristic</span> among individuals of the <span style="color: aqua">same species</span>.

#### Types of variations
##### Discontinuous variations
**Discontinuous variations** is a type of variation that has a <span style="color: lightgreen">few distinct phenotypes</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">no intermediate forms</span>.
- These characteristics are usually controlled by <span style="color: lightgreen">one gene</span> and are <span style="color: lightgreen">relatively unaffected by environmental factors</span>.
- Surveys for variation are presented in <span style="color: violet">bar charts</span>.

**Examples**: Blood groups, tongue-rolling ability

##### Continuous variations
**Continuous variations** is a type of variation that shows a <span style="color: lightgreen">continuous range of intermediate forms</span>.
- These characteristics are <span style="color: lightgreen">easily affected by environmental factors</span>.
- Surveys for variation are presented in <span style="color: violet">histograms</span>. Large sample sizes often result in bell-shaped charts with a normal distribution.

**Examples**: Height, weight, IQ

#### Sources of variations
1. **Sexual reproduction**
   ↪️ Produces offspring with a mix of genetic materials from parents.

2. [[Independent assortment]]
   ↪️ Results in different combinations of chromosomes.

3. [[Crossing over]]
   ↪️ Results in new combinations of alleles in chromosomes.

4. **Random fusion of gametes at fertilization**
   ↪️ Results in zygote with different combinations of genetic materials.

5. [[Mutations]]
   ↪️ Results in new alleles.
