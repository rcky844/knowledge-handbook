**Variations** are <span class="hi-green">differences in characteristic</span> among individuals of the <span class="hi-green">same species</span>.

# Types of variations
## Discontinuous variations
**Discontinuous variations** is a type of variation that has a <span class="hi-green">few distinct phenotypes</span> and <span class="hi-green">no intermediate forms</span>.
- These characteristics are usually controlled by <span class="hi-green">one gene</span> and are <span class="hi-green">relatively unaffected by environmental factors</span>.
- Surveys for variation are presented in <span class="hi-blue">bar charts</span>.

**Examples**: Blood groups, tongue-rolling ability

## Continuous variations
**Continuous variations** is a type of variation that shows a <span class="hi-green">continuous range of intermediate forms</span>.
- These characteristics are <span class="hi-green">easily affected by environmental factors</span>.
- Surveys for variation are presented in <span class="hi-blue">histograms</span>. Large sample sizes often result in bell-shaped charts with a normal distribution.

**Examples**: Height, weight, IQ

# Sources of variations
1. **Sexual reproduction**
   ↪ Produces offspring with a mix of genetic materials from parents.

2. [[Independent assortment]]
   ↪ Results in different combinations of chromosomes.

3. [[Crossing over]]
   ↪ Results in new combinations of alleles in chromosomes.

4. **Random fusion of gametes at fertilization**
   ↪ Results in zygote with different combinations of genetic materials.

5. [[Mutations]]
   ↪ Results in new alleles.
