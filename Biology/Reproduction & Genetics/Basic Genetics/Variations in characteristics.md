**Variations** are the <u>differences in characteristic</u> among individuals of the <u>same species</u>.
\
#### Types of variations
##### Discontinuous variations
**Discontinuous variations** is a type of variation that has a <u>few distinct phenotypes</u> and <u>no intermediate forms</u>.
- These characteristics are usually controlled by <u>one gene</u> and are <u>relatively unaffected by environmental factors</u>.
- Surveys for variation are presented in <u>bar charts</u>.

**Examples**: Blood groups, tongue-rolling ability

##### Continuous variations
**Continuous variations** is a type of variation that shows a <u>continuous range of intermediate values</u>.
- These characteristics are <u>easily affected by environmental factors</u>.
- Surveys for variation are presented in <u>histograms</u>. Large sample sizes often result in bell-shaped charts with a normal distribution.

**Examples**: Height, weight, IQ

#### Sources of variations
1. **Sexual reproduction**
   It produces offspring with a mix of genetic materials from parents.

2. [[Independent assortment]]
   It results in different combinations of chromosomes.

3. [[Crossing over]]
   It results in new combinations of alleles in chromosomes.

4. **Random fusion of gametes at fertilization**
   It results in zygote with different combinations of genetic materials.

5. [[Mutations]]
   It results in new alleles.
