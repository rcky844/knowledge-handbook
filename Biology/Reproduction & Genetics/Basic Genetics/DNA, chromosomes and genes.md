#### Structure of DNA
*Pre-context: [[Nucleic acids]] / [[Chromosome]]*

**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** is the chemical that stores the genetic information in a cell. It is usually found in the [[Nucleus]].

Each DNA molecules wraps around special proteins and coils up to form chromatin. When a cell is going to divide, the chrIn the cell cycle, omatin condenses to form a [[chromosome]].

- A DNA molecule consists of <span style="color: lightgreen">two polynucleotide chains</span> (i.e. two DNA strands). The two strands run in <span style="color: skyblue">opposite directions</span> and are twisted together to form a <span style="color: skyblue">double helix</span>.
- The backbone of the DNA molecule is made up of the <span style="color: lightgreen">sugar (deoxyribose)</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">phosphate groups</span> of nucleotides.
- Attached to the sugar of each nucleotide is one of <span style="color: lightgreen">four nitrogenous bases</span>: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). They can do <u>complementary base pairing</u>.
- Genetic information is stored in the sequence of the nucleotide bases in DNA.

**Complementary base paring**: Bases on one strand pair up with those on the other strand through [[hydrogen bonds]], and A always pair up with T and G pairs with C.

##### Significance for storage of genetic information
- DNA is a large molecule made up of a huge number of nucleotides, it can **store a very large amount of genetic information**.

- DNA molecule is **stable**. The sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of the net are joined together by <u>strong</u> [[Covalent bonds]], forming a strong sugar-phosphate backbone. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between the bases of the two stands of DNA hold the two strands together and stabilize the helical structure.

- **Complementary base pairing** enables DNA to **replicate** (make an **exact** copy of itself) every time a cell divides, so that genetic information is passed on to new cells.

#### Genes
A **gene** is a short length of DNA in a [[chromosome]].
- The sequence of bases in the DNA of a gene provides the genetic code that determines the sequence of amino acids in a particular **polypeptide**, making up [[Proteins]] for building body parts, [[Enzymes]] and [[hormones]].
- Genes are the <span style="color: skyblue">basic unit of heredity</span> and determines **traits** (body characteristics) of an organism by controlling how proteins are made. Traits may be controlled by one or more genes.

> **Note**:
> The alleles of a gene may differ from each other by only one or a few bases.

##### Locus and alleles
**Locus** is the position of a particular gene on a chromosome.

**Allele** is a pair of genes that is located on a locus of two homologous chromosomes. The pair controls one characteristic / trait of an organism.
- **Homozygous** refers to having two identical alleles (e.g. $RR$, $rr$).
- **Heterozygous** refers to having two different alleles (e.g. $Rr$).

> **Note**:
> Allele is the alternative form of the gene. However, it only applies to homologous chromosomes.

##### Common terms for genetics
- **Genotype** is the <span style="color: lightgreen">genetic composition</span> (combination of alleles) of a characteristic (e.g. $RR$, $rr$, $Rr$). It can also be described with nouns.
- **Phenotype** is the <span style="color: lightgreen">observable feature of a characteristic</span> of an organism.
- **Dominant allele** is an allele that <span style="color: lightgreen">can express its effect whether in a homozygous or heteroeygous condition</span>.
- **Recessive allele** is an allele that <span style="color: lightgreen">can express its effect only in a homozygous condition</span>.
