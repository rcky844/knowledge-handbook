#### Structure of DNA
*Pre-context: [[Nucleic acids]] / [[Chromosome]]*

**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** is the chemical that stores the genetic information in a cell. It is usually found in the [[nucleus]].

Each DNA molecules wraps around special proteins and coils up to form chromatin. When a cell is going to divide, the chromatin condenses to form a [[chromosome]].

The following is the three-dimensional model for the structure of DNA is proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953:
- A DNA molecule consists of <span style="color: lightgreen">two polynucleotide chains</span> (i.e. two DNA strands). The two strands run in <span style="color: skyblue">opposite directions</span> and are twisted together to form a <span style="color: skyblue">double helix</span>.
- The backbone of the DNA molecule is made up of the <span style="color: lightgreen">sugar (deoxyribose)</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">phosphate groups</span> of nucleotides.
- Attached to the sugar of each nucleotide is one of <span style="color: lightgreen">four nitrogenous bases</span>: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C). They can do <u>complementary base pairing</u>.

**Complementary base paring**: Bases on one strand pair up with those on the other strand through [[hydrogen bonds]], and A always pair up with T and G pairs with C.

##### Significance for storage of genetic information
- Genetic information is stored in the sequence of the nucleotide bases in DNA. Since DNA is a large molecule made up of a huge number of nucleotides, it can **store a very large amount of genetic information**.

- DNA molecule is **stable**. The sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of the net are joined together by <u>strong</u> [[covalent bonds]], forming a strong sugar-phosphate backbone. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between the bases of the two stands of DNA hold the two strands together and stabilize the helical structure.

- **Complementary base pairing** enables DNA to **replicate** (make an **exact** copy of itself) every time a cell divides, so that genetic information is passed on to new cells.

##### Process of DNA replication
1. A segment of DNA before replication has [[hydrogen bonds]] between the bases, holding the two DNA strands together.

2. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between the bases break. The two DNA strands separate. Each DNA strand acts as a template.

3. Free nucleotides bind to the DNA templates by base pairing. Nucleotides are joined together with the help of [[enzymes|enzyme]] DNA polymerase.

4. Two identical DNA molecules are formed, each of which consists of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.

#### Genes
A **gene** is a short length of DNA in a [[chromosome]].
- The sequence of bases in the DNA of a gene provides the genetic code that determines the sequence of amino acids in a particular **polypeptide**, making up [[proteins]] for building body parts, [[enzymes]] and [[hormones]].
- Genes are the <span style="color: skyblue">basic unit of heredity</span> and determines **traits** (body characteristics) of an organism by controlling how proteins are made. Traits may be controlled by one or more genes.

> **Note**:
> - Some human traits are visible (e.g. eye colour). Others are not visible (e.g. blood group).
> - The alleles of a gene may differ from each other by only one or a few bases.

##### Locus and alleles
**Locus** is the position of a particular gene on a chromosome. **Alleles** are the alternative forms of loci. The alleles of any particular gene lie at the same gene locus on a pair of homologous chromosomes.

**Homozygous** refers to having two identical alleles for a gene. **Heterozygous** refers to having two different alleles.
