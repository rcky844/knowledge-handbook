1. A segment of DNA before replication has [[hydrogen bonds]] between the bases, holding the two DNA strands together.
2. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between the bases break. The two DNA strands separate. Each DNA strand acts as a template.
3. Free nucleotides bind to the DNA templates by base pairing. Nucleotides are joined together with the help of [[Enzymes|enzyme]] DNA polymerase.
4. Two identical DNA molecules are formed, each of which consists of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.
