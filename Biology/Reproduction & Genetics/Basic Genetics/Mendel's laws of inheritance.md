**Gregor Mendel** studied inheritance scientifically in the 1860s by conducting <u>breeding experiments</u> on <span style="color: skyblue">pea plants</span> and studied how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next.

**Pea plants** are chosen because:
- They had easily observable characteristics.
- They grew fast.
- They were easy to handle.

#### Common terms for genetics
- **Genotype** is the <span style="color: lightgreen">genetic makeup</span> (combination of alleles) of an organism.
- **Phenotype** is the <span style="color: lightgreen">observable characteristic</span> of an organism.
- **Dominant allele** is an allele that <span style="color: lightgreen">can express its effect whether in a homozygous or heteroeygous condition</span>.
- **Recessive allele** is an allele that <span style="color: lightgreen">can express its effect only in a homozygous condition</span>.

#### Monohybrid inheritance
**Monohybrid inheritance** is the inheritance of <u>single characteristics</u> that is controlled by a <u>single gene</u>. These characters are <u>contrasting</u>.

##### Breeding experiment by Mendal
Mendel first cross-pollinated pure-breeding tall plants with pure-breeding short plans. The plants produced were known as the <span style="color: skyblue">first filial generation</span> ($F_1$ generation). All plants in this generation were tall.

> **Note**:
> Pure-breeding plants always produce offspring with the same character when self-pollinated.

$F_1$ tall plants were allowed to self-pollinate. A second generation ($F_2$ generation) is produced, with a $F_2$ ratio of approximately $3:1$ (787 tall plants and 277 short plants).

> **Note**:
> - The reproductive structures of pea flowers are completely and enclosed, it would usually self-pollinate.
> - Mendel ensured self-pollination by enclosing the flower in a bag so that no pollen from another plant could pollinate that flower.

The above breeding experiment is an example of <span style="color: skyblue">monohybrid cross</span>, in which the two parent plants differ in only one single characteristic.

##### Interpretation of Mendel's monohybrid crosses
When repeated on pea plants with different pairs of contrasting characters, there are two things in particular:
- In the $F_1$ generation, <span style="color: lightgreen">only one of the two contrasting characters of the parent plant</span> was observed.
- The character that had <span style="color: lightgreen">disappeared</span> in the $F_1$ generation <span style="color: lightgreen">showed up again</span> in the $F_2$ generation, and there was an approximately $3:1$ <span style="color: lightgreen">ratio</span> of the two characters in the offspring.

The **law of segregation**, or **Mendel's first law of inheritance**, states that <u>allele pairs separate</u> during gamete formation (in [[meiotic cell division]]) so that <u>each gamete receives one allele of each gene</u>.

The following conclusion can be made on the above experiment (where alleles for tallness and shortness is represented by $T$ and $t$ respectively):
- The <span style="color: skyblue">pure-breeding tall parent</span> are **homozygous** (homozygotes) and has two alleles for tallness while the short parent has two alleles for shortness. The genotype of the tall parent and short parent are $TT$ and $tt$ respectively.
- Plants with the genotype $Tt$ is produced. $F_1$ offspring are **heterozygous** (heterozygotes) for the gene for stem length as they have different alleles.
- The **phenotype** of $F_1$ plants is tall even though they contain an allele for shortness $t$. This is because allele $T$ masks the expression of allele $t$. ($T$ is dominant, $t$ is recessive)
