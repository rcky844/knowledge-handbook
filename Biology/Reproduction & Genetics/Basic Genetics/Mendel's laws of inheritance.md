#### Types of inheritance
- **Monohybrid inheritance**: The inheritance of <u>single characteristics</u> that are controlled by a <u>single gene</u>. These characters are <u>contrasting</u> (e.g. red or white flower).
- **Dihybrid inheritance**: The simultaneous inheritance of <u>two characteristics</u>. The two characteristics are <u>controlled by two different genes</u>.

#### Mendal's laws
- **Law of Dominance** (First law of inheritance)
  Hybrid offspring will only inherit the dominant trait in the phenotype.

- **Law of Segregation** (Third law of inheritance)
  During the production of gametes, two copies of each hereditary factor segregate so that offspring acquire one factor from each parent when the gametes re-unite randomly during fertilization.

- **Law of Independent Assortment** (Second law of inheritance)
  A pair of traits segregates independently of another pair during gamete formation.

#### Mendel's experiments
**Mendel's laws of inheritance** was proposed by Gregor Mendel in the 1860s after conducting <u>breeding experiments</u> on <span style="color: skyblue">pea plants</span>.

Two main experiments to determine the laws of inheritance will be discussed:
- Monohybrid Cross
- Dihybrid Cross

**Pea plants** were chosen because:
- They had easily observable characteristics.
- They grew fast.
- They were easy to handle.

##### Monohybrid Cross
Mendel took two pea plants of opposite traits (one short and one tall) and crossed them. He found the $F_1$ generation offspring were tall. Then he crossed the $F_1$ filial generation and obtained both tall and short plants in the ratio $3:1$ (monohybrid ratio) in the $F_2$ generation.

##### Dihybrid cross
Mendel crossed wrinkled-green seed and round-yellow seeds and observed that all the $F_1$ generation were round-yellow. This meant that dominant traits were the round shape and yellow colour.

He then self-pollinated the $F_1$ generation and obtained 4 different traits: round-yellow, round-green, wrinkled-yellow, and wrinkled-green seeds in the ratio $9:3:3:1$ (dihybrid ratio) in the $F_2$ generation.

#### Deducing dominant and recessive allele
Consider the colour of pea flowers, where $R$ represents the dominant allele for red colour, $r$ represents the recessive allele for white colour.

To deduce the dominant allele, find a pair of <u>parents with the same phenotype</u> but their <u>offsprings have different phenotypes</u>.

**Principles for deduction**:
- The genotype of the the offspring results in the phenotype expressed.
- All genes are inherited from the offsprings' parents.

**Deduction**:
- Offspring D is white in colour, then it posses white colour allele.
- This white colour allele is inherited from one of its parents, A or B.
- Either A or B should posses a white colour allele.
- However, A and B are all red in colour, that means they all also posses red colour allele.
- So A or B should be heterozygous, and since red colour allele express in this condition, red colour allele is dominant.
