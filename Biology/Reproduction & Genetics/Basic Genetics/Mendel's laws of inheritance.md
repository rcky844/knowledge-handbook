# Types of inheritance
- **Monohybrid inheritance**: The inheritance of <span class="hi-blue">single characteristics</span> that are controlled by a <span class="hi-blue">single gene</span>. These characters are <span class="hi-green">contrasting</span> (e.g. red or white flower).
- **Dihybrid inheritance**: The simultaneous inheritance of <span class="hi-blue">two characteristics</span>. The two characteristics are <span class="hi-green">controlled by two different genes</span>.

# Mendal's laws
- **Law of Dominance** (First law of inheritance)
  Heterozygote (hybrid) will only express the dominant trait in the phenotype.

- **Law of Segregation** (Third law of inheritance)
  During the production of gametes, two copies of each hereditary factor segregate so that <u>offspring acquire one factor from each parent</u> when the gametes re-unite randomly <u>during fertilization</u>.

- **Law of Independent Assortment** (Second law of inheritance)
  A pair of traits segregates independently of another pair during gamete formation.

# Mendel's experiments
**Mendel's laws of inheritance** was proposed by Gregor Mendel in the 1860s after conducting <u>breeding experiments</u> on <span class="hi-blue">pea plants</span>.

**Pea plants** were chosen because:
- They had easily observable characteristics.
- They grew fast.
- They were easy to handle.

## Monohybrid Cross
![[monohybrid_cross.webp|400]]
- Mendel took two pea plants of opposite traits (one short and one tall - <span class="hi-green">homozygous</span>) and crossed them. He found the $F_1$ generation offspring were tall (<span class="hi-green">homozygous dominant</span>).
- Then, he crossed the $F_1$ filial generation and obtained both tall and short plants in the ratio $3:1$ (<span class="hi-blue">monohybrid ratio</span>) in the $F_2$ generation.

## Dihybrid cross
![[dihybrid_cross.webp|500]]
- Mendel crossed wrinkled-green seed and round-yellow seeds and observed that all the $F_1$ generation were round-yellow (<span class="hi-green">heterozygous</span>). This meant that dominant traits were the round shape and yellow colour.
- He then self-pollinated the $F_1$ generation and obtained 4 different traits: round-yellow, round-green, wrinkled-yellow, and wrinkled-green seeds in the ratio $9:3:3:1$ (<span class="hi-blue">dihybrid ratio</span>) in the $F_2$ generation.

# Deducing dominant and recessive allele
Consider the colour of pea flowers, where $R$ represents the dominant allele for red colour, $r$ represents the recessive allele for white colour.

To deduce the dominant allele, find a pair of <span class="hi-green">parents with the same phenotype</span> but their <span class="hi-green">offsprings have different phenotypes</span>.

**Principles for deduction**:
- The <u>genotype</u> of the the offspring results in the <u>phenotype</u> expressed.
- All <u>genes</u> are <u>inherited from the offsprings' parents</u>.

**Deduction**:
- Offspring D is white in colour, so it <u>posses white colour allele</u>.
- As the white colour allele is <u>inherited from one of its parents, A or B</u>, <u>either A or B should posses a white colour allele.</u>
- However, A and B are all <u>red in colour</u>, that means they all also <u>posses red colour allele</u>.
- So <u>either A or B</u> should be <span class="hi-blue">heterozygous</span>, and since red colour allele express in this condition, red colour allele is dominant.
