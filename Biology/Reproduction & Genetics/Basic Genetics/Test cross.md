**Test cross** is used to find out an organism's genotype (homozygous or heterozygous).

*Method*:
Cross an organism with another organism with <span class="hi-green">homozygous recessive</span> phenotype.
- If all the offspring produced express <span class="hi-green">homozygous dominant</span> phenotype, then the organism crossed is <span class="hi-blue">homozygous</span>.
- If the offsprings are <span class="hi-green">half dominant and half recessive</span> (phenotypic ratio $1:1$), the organism is <span class="hi-blue">heterozygous</span>.
