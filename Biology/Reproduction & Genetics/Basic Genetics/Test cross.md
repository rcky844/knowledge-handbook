**Test cross** is used to find out an organism's genotype (homozygous or heterozygous).

**Method**:
Cross an organism with another organism with <u>homozygous recessive</u> phenotype.
- If all the offspring produced express <u>homozygous dominant</u> phenotype, then the organism crossed is **homozygous**.
- If the offsprings are <u>half dominant and half recessive</u> (phenotypic ratio $1:1$), the organism is **heterozygous**.
