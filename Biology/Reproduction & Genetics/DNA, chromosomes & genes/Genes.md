> **Series**: DNA, chromosomes & genes
> [[DNA]] - [[Chromosomes]] - *Genes*

A **gene** is a short length of DNA in a <span style="color: violet">chromosome</span>.
- The sequence of bases in the DNA of a gene provides the genetic code that determines the sequence of amino acids in a particular **polypeptide**, making up [[Proteins]] for building body parts, [[Enzymes]] and [[hormones]].
- Genes are the <span style="color: skyblue">basic unit of heredity</span> and determines **traits** (body characteristics) of an organism by controlling how proteins are made. Traits may be controlled by one or more genes.

> The alleles of a gene may differ from each other by only one or a few bases.

#### Locus and alleles
**Locus** is the position of a particular gene on a chromosome.

**Allele** is a pair of genes that is located on a locus of two homologous chromosomes. The pair controls one characteristic / trait of an organism.
- **Homozygous** refers to having two identical alleles (e.g. $RR$, $rr$).
- **Heterozygous** refers to having two different alleles (e.g. $Rr$).

> [!note]
> Allele is the alternative form of the gene. However, it only applies to homologous chromosomes.

#### Common terms for genetics
- **Genotype** is the <span style="color: lightgreen">genetic composition</span> (combination of alleles) of a characteristic (e.g. $RR$, $rr$, $Rr$). It can also be described with nouns.
- **Phenotype** is the <span style="color: lightgreen">observable feature of a characteristic</span> of an organism.
- **Dominant allele** is an allele that <span style="color: lightgreen">can express its effect whether in a homozygous or heteroeygous condition</span>.
- **Recessive allele** is an allele that <span style="color: lightgreen">can express its effect only in a homozygous condition</span>.
