**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** is the chemical that stores genetic information in a cell. It is usually found in the [[nucleus]].
- A DNA molecule consists of <span style="color: lightgreen">two polynucleotide chains</span> (i.e. two DNA strands) that run in <span style="color: skyblue">opposite directions</span> and are twisted together to form a <span style="color: skyblue">double helix</span>. (anti-parallel relationship)
- The backbone of the DNA molecule is made up of the <span style="color: lightgreen">sugar (deoxyribose)</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">phosphate groups</span> of nucleotides.
- Attached to the sugar of each nucleotide is one of <span style="color: lightgreen">four nitrogenous bases</span>: <u>adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C)</u>. They can do <span style="color: violet">complementary base pairing</span>.
- Genetic information is stored in the sequence of the nucleotide bases in DNA.

**Complementary base paring**: Bases on one strand pair up with those on the other strand through [[hydrogen bonds]]. A always pair up with T, and G always pairs with C.
- A-T: 2 hydrogen bonds
- G-C: 3 hydrogen bonds

#### Significance for storage of genetic information
- DNA is a large molecule made up of a huge number of nucleotides, it can <span style="color: lightgreen">store a very large amount of genetic information</span>.

- DNA molecule is <span style="color: lightgreen">stable</span>. The sugar-phosphate backbone is joined together by <u>strong</u> [[covalent bonds]], and there are [[hydrogen bonds]] between the bases of the two stands of DNA to hold the two strands together, stabilizing the helical structure.

- <span style="color: lightgreen">Complementary base pairing enables DNA to replicate</span> (make an <span style="color: violet">exact</span> copy of itself) every time a cell divides, so that genetic information is passed on to new cells.
