A **chromosome** is made up of DNA wrapped around protein molecules <span class="hi-blue">histone</span>. 
- When a cell is going to divide, chromatin condenses to form a <span class="hi-blue">chromosome</span>.
- Chromosomes are normally <span class="hi-green">visible under a light microscope</span> only during the <span class="hi-blue">metaphase</span> of cell division.

# Role in cell division
![[chromosome_cartoonish.webp|250]]

In [[interphase]], each chromosome is duplicated (DNA is replicated).

When the cell is about to divide at the beginning of [[nuclear division]] (prophase), the [[Interphase#Under light microscope|chromatin]] coils tightly into a chromosome.
- Each chromosome is visible as a <span class="hi-green">X-shaped structure</span> made up of two <span class="hi-blue">chromatids</span> joined together at the <span class="hi-blue">centromere</span>.
- The joined copies are now referred to as <span class="hi-blue">sister chromatids</span> (as they are identical copies of each other).

During cell division, genetic information is <span class="hi-green">carried by DNA</span> (deoxyribonucleic acid) to be passed from a parent cell to the daughter cells.

# Numbers of chromosomes
The number of chromosomes in a single cell varies from species to species. However, all <span class="hi-blue">somatic cells</span> from a particular species have a fixed number of chromosomes.
- **Diploid** ($2n$): Cell or organism with two sets of chromosomes.
  e.g. human somatic cells
- **Haploid** ($n$): Cell with only one set of chromosomes.
  e.g. sex cells, gametes

# Homologous chromosomes
**Homologous chromosomes** are a pair of chromosomes with the same size and shape. They have the same organisation of [[genes]].

It is formed when <span class="hi-green">one maternal and one paternal chromosome pair up</span> with each other inside a cell during fertilization.

- **Parental chromosomes**: The set of chromosomes from <u>male</u> parent.
- **Maternal chromosomes**: The set of chromosomes from <u>female</u> parent.
