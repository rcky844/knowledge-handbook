A **chromosome** is made up of DNA wrapped around protein molecules <span style="color: skyblue">histone</span>. 
- When a cell is going to divide, chromatin condenses to form a <span style="color: violet">chromosome</span>.
- Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only during the <span style="color: skyblue">metaphase</span> of cell division.

#### Role in cell division
![[chromosome_cartoonish.webp|250]]

In [[interphase]], each chromosome is duplicated (DNA is replicated).

When the cell is about to divide at the beginning of [[nuclear division]] (prophase), the [[Interphase#Under light microscope|chromatin]] coils tightly into a chromosome.
- Each chromosome is visible as a X-shaped structure made up of two chromatids joined together at the centromere.
- The joined copies are now referred to as sister chromatids (as they are identical copies of each other).

During cell division, genetic information is carried by DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) to be passed from a parent cell to the daughter cells.

#### Numbers of chromosomes
The number of chromosomes in a single cell varies from species to species. However, all somatic cells from a particular species have a fixed number of chromosomes.
- **Diploid** ($2n$): Cell or organism with two sets of chromosomes.
  e.g. human somatic cells
- **Haploid** ($n$): Cell with only one set of chromosomes.
  e.g. sex cells, gametes

#### Homologous chromosomes
**Homologous chromosomes** are a pair of chromosomes with the same size and shape. They have the same organisation of [[genes]].

It is formed when <span style="color: lightgreen">one maternal and one paternal chromosome pair up</span> with each other inside a cell during fertilization.

- **Parental chromosomes**: The set of chromosomes from <u>male</u> parent.
- **Maternal chromosomes**: The set of chromosomes from <u>female</u> parent.
