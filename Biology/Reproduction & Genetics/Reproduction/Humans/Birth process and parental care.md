# Birth process
A few weeks before birth, the fetus changes its position so that its head is downwards just above the cervix.

At the start of child birth, muscles of the uterus contract regularly when <span class="hi-blue">labour</span> begins, with the contractions gradually becoming more frequent and powerful.

## Stages of labour
- **Dilation of the cervix**
  ![[labour1.webp|240]]
  The cervix dilates to let the head of the fetus pass through.
  The amnion breaks and amniotic fluid flows out through the vagina, which helps lubricate the vagina for the passage of the fetus.

- **Expulsion of the fetus**
  ![[labour2.webp|120]]
  Muscles of the uterus and the abdominal muscles contract strongly, pushing the fetus head-first through the cervix and vagina (birth canal).
  The baby takes its first breath after coming out of the internal environment. The umbilical cord is clamped and cut, and the remains of the cord on the babyâ€™s body dries up and falls off a few days later, forming a scar called the navel.

- **Expulsion of the placenta**

  Continued contractions of the uterus cause the placenta to detach from the uterine lining, passing out through the vagina eventually.

## Significance
- Increases the survival chance of the young
- Promote healthy development

## Breast-feeding and its benefits
- During pregnancy, mammary glands in mother's breasts enlarge and become able to produce milk.
- Babies are born with the instinct to suck. When the baby sucks the nipples, the breasts are stimulated to produce and release milk in a process called <u>lactation</u>.

Benefits of breast-feeding for babies:
- Breast milk contains the <span class="hi-green">right amounts of all essential nutrients for the baby</span>.
- Proteins in breast milk is easy for babies to digest and absorb.
- Breast milk <span class="hi-green">contains enzymes</span> (e.g. amylase, lipase, protease) to help digest food. This is because babies are born with an immature pancreas, so they get most of this essential digestive enzyme through breast milk.
- Breast milk <span class="hi-green">contains antibodies</span> that help protect babies against some infectious diseases (e.g. pneumonia, ear infections, etc).
