#### Menstruation (Day 1 - 5)
- **Thickened uterine lining breaks down** when [[Sexual intercourse and fertilization#Fertilization|fertilization]] does not occur.
  Menstrual blood (including blood, mucus, uterine tissues, unfertilized ovum) is passed out of the body through the vagina.

#### Repairing of the uterine lining (Day 6 - 13)
- **Secretion of oestrogen (a type of female sex hormone)**
  The follicle in the ovary develops and secretes oestrogen, which causes the uterine lining to repair and thicken to prepare for implantation of the embryo.
- **The uterine lining is also richly supplied with blood vessels** to <u>prepare for supplying the embryo with oxygen and nutrients</u>.

#### Ovulation (Day 14)
- The **mature follicle ruptures** and <u>releases an ovum</u> into the oviduct.
- The **beating action of cilia** lining the oviduct <u>creates a current to suck the ovum into the oviducts</u>.

#### Further thickening of the uterine lining (Day 15 - 28)
- The uterine lining further thickens and is ready for the implantation of the embryo.
- The ruptured follicle becomes the yellow body. It later degenerates if the released ovum is not fertilized.
- If fertilization occurs and the woman becomes pregnant, the uterine lining does not break down. Menstruation will occur only after the birth of the baby.

> **Notes**:
> - **Menarche** refers to a woman's first menstruation, which usually occurs at the age of about 11.
> - **Menopause** occurs when a woman reaches 45 to 55 years of age. As a woman's ovary contain only a set number of follicles, her ovaries will stop releasing ova and menstruation will no longer occur.
