*Pre-context: [[Menstrual cycle]]*

# Hormones
| Hormone | Site of secretion | Target organ | Major function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) | Pituitary gland | Ovary | Stimulates follicle development in the ovary |
| Luteinising hormone (LH) | Pituitary gland | Ovary | Stimulates ovulation to occur |
| Oestrogen | Developing follicle; Yellow body in ovary | Uterine lining; Pituitary gland | Stimulates the uterine lining to thicken |
| Progesterone | Yellow body in ovary | Uterine lining; Pituitary gland | Maintains thickened uterine lining |

# Events in the menstrual cycle
![[hormonal_menstrual_cycle.webp|600]]

## Before ovulation (day 1-13)
> [!tip]
> The first day of menstruation is counted as day 1 in the menstrual cycle.

- <span class="hi-blue">Menstruation</span> occurs, a process which discharges the shed uterine lining together with blood through the vagina. This lasts about five days.
- <span class="hi-green">Pituitary gland secretes more FSH</span>. FSH <span class="hi-orange">stimulates follicle development</span> in the ovary.
- Developing follicle secretes oestrogen.
	- Uterine lining thickens.
	- <span class="hi-green">Secretion of FSH and LH is inhibited</span> through negative feedback, <span class="hi-blue">preventing the development of other follicles</span> and ensures only one ovum is released in each menstrual cycle.

## At ovulation (day 14)
- Level of oestrogen continues to rise and peaks just before ovulation.
- <span class="hi-green">The pituitary gland is stimulated to secrete more FSH ad LH.</span>, stimulating <span class="hi-blue">ovulation</span> to occur, where a mature follicle ruptures and releases an ovum into the oviduct.

## After ovulation (day 15-28)
- A high LH level causes the ruptured follicle to develop into a <span class="hi-blue">yellow body</span> (corpus luteum), which <span class="hi-green">secretes oestrogen and progesterone</span>. This also cause a <span class="hi-blue">rise in body temperature</span> just after ovulation.
- Progesterone together with oestrogen maintains the thickness of the uterine lining and stimulates blood vessel development in the lining in preparation for the implantation of an embryo.
- <span class="hi-orange">A high oestrogen and progesterone level inhibit the secretion of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland</span>, <span class="hi-blue">preventing the development of another follicle or further ovulation within the same menstrual cycle</span>.
- <span class="hi-green">A low LH level causes the yellow body to degenerate</span>, leading to low levels of oestrogen and progesterone in the blood. The uterine lining cannot maintain its thickness and breaks down by menstruation.
- Low levels of oestrogen and progesterone no longer inhibit the pituitary gland, FSH secretion is increases, a new cycle begins.
