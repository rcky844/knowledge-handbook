*Pre-context: [[Menstrual cycle]]*

#### Hormones
| Hormone | Site of secretion | Target organ | Major function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) | Pituitary gland | Ovary | Stimulates follicle development in the ovary |
| Luteinising hormone (LSH) | Pituitary gland | Ovary | Stimulates ovulation to occur |
| Oestrogen | Developing follicle; Yellow body in ovary | Uterine lining; Pituitary gland | Stimulates the uterine lining to thicken |
| Progesterone | Yellow body in ovary | Uterine lining; Pituitary gland | Maintains thickened uterine lining |

#### Events in the menstrual cycle

##### Before ovulation (day 1-13)
> [!tip]
> The first day of menstruation is counted as day 1 in the menstrual cycle.

- Menstruation occurs, a process which discharges the shed uterine lining together with blood through the vagina. This lasts about five days.
- Pituitary gland secretes more FSH, level of FSH in blood rises. FSH stimulates follicle development in thhe ovary.
- Developing follicle secretes oestrogen, level of oestrogen in blood rises.
	- The uterine lining is stimulated to thicken.
	- Secretion of FSH and LH is inhibited through negative feedback, levels of FSH and LH in blood falls. This prevents the development of other follicles and ensures only one ovum is released in each menstrual cycle.

##### At ovulation (day 14)
- Level of oestrogen continues to rise and peaks just before ovulation.
- The pituitary gland is stimulated to secrete more FSH ad LH, levels of FSH and LH in blood will rise sharply.
- A high LH level stimulates ovulation to occur, where a mature follicle ruptures and releases an ovum into the oviduct.

##### After ovulation (day 15-28)
- A high LH level causes the ruptured follicle to develop into a yellow body (corpus luteum), which secretes oestrogen and progesterone. Levels of oestrogen and progesterone in blood rises. This also cause a rise in body temperature just after ovulation.
- Progesterone together with oestrogen maintains the thickness of the uterine lining and stimulates blood vessel development in the lining in preparation for the implantation of an embryo.
- A high oestrogen and progesterone level inhibit the secretion of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland, preventing the development of another follicle or further ovulation within the same menstrual cycle.
- A low LH level in blood causes the yellow body to degenerate, leading to low levels of oestrogen and progesterone in the blood. The uterine lining cannot maintain its thickness and breaks down by menstruation.
- Low levels of oestrogen and progesterone no longer inhibit the pituitary gland, FSH secretion is increases, a new cycle begins.
