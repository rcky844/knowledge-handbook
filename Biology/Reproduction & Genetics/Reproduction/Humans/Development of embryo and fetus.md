#### Implantation
![[implantation.webp]]
- A zygote divides by repeated [[mitotic cell division]] during when it travels along the oviduct, forming an embryo. <span style="color: lightgreen">The woman is not considered pregnant before the embryo then implants into the uterine lining.</span>
- The embryo reaches the uterus <span style="color: red">around seven days after fertilization</span>, containing <u>200 to 300 cells</u>. It <span style="color: lightblue">embeds itself in the uterine lining in a process called implantation</span>. This marks the start of pregnancy.

#### Formation of the amnion
![[amnion.webp|600]]
As the embryo continues to develop in the uterus, <span style="color: lightgreen">some cells of the embryo form a membrane</span> called the **amnion**.

The **amniotic cavity** between the amnion and embryo is also filled with **amniotic fluid**. It has the following functions:
- Act as a <span style="color: lightgreen">shock-absorber</span>, <span style="color: red">protecting the embryo from mechanical injury</span>.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Prevents</span> the embryo from <span style="color: lightgreen">drying out</span> (desiccation).
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Provides a stable environment</span> (e.g constant temperature, pH, etc.) for the embryo.
- Allows the embryo some <span style="color: lightgreen">freedom of movement</span>.
- Helps <span style="color: lightgreen">lubricate the birth canal during childbirth</span>.

#### Formation of the placenta
![[placenta.webp|666]]
The **placenta** is composed of tissues from both the mother and the embryo.

The **placenta** has villi containing the embryo's capillaries that grow into blood spaces in the uterine lining and are bathed in the maternal blood after implantation, allowing for the exchange of materials between the embryo and the mother without mixing their blood. There are some reasons for doing this:
- It prevents the <span style="color: lightgreen">clumping</span> of embryo's blood and maternal blood when their <span style="color: red">blood groups are incompatible</span>.
- It prevents the <span style="color: lightgreen">high blood pressure</span> of maternal blood from <span style="color: red">damaging the embryo's delicate blood vessels</span>.
- It prevents <span style="color: lightgreen">large pathogens and toxins</span> in the maternal blood from entering the embryo's blood.

The **placenta** also secretes hormones (oestrogen & progestrone) to help maintain the uterine lining throughout pregnancy, so menstruation will not occur and the embryo can develop in a stable environment.

##### Material exchange at the placenta
Materials that diffuse from maternal blood into embryo's blood:
- [[Human nutrition|Nutrients]] (e.g. glucose, amino acids, minerals and vitamins)
- Oxygen
- [[Antibodies]]

Materials produced by the embryo and diffuses into the maternal blood:
- Metabolic wastes (e.g. urea and carbon dioxide)

##### Transport of materials
The embryo is connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord, which contains:
- **An umbilical vein**, carrying <u>oxygenated blood and nutrients</u>.
- **Two umbilical arteries**, carrying <u>deoxygenated blood and waste products</u>.

##### Adaptations of the placenta for the exchange of materials
1. **Presence of numerous villi**
   This provides a large surface area for the exchange of materials.

2. **Embryo's blood is close to the maternal blood**
   This reduces the distance for diffusion of materials.

3. **Richly supplied with blood vessels**
   This allows an efficient transport of materials away from the placenta by maintaining a steep concentration gradient of materials between the embryo's blood and the maternal blood.

#### Formation of twins
**Identical twins** are genetically identical twins that look alike and are of the same sex. They are formed from <u>one zygote</u> which divides into two separate cells and each cell grows into an embryo.

**Fraternal twins** are genetically different twins and can be of the same sex or different sexes. They are formed from <u>two ova</u> are released from the ovaries and are fertilized independently by two sperms.

#### Gestation period
The **gestation period** refers to the period from fertilization to birth, which takes about 38 weeks in humans until the fetus is ready to be born.

The embryo becomes a fetus eight weeks after fertilization, with all major organs formed. It contains to grow and develop in the mother's uterus till birth.
