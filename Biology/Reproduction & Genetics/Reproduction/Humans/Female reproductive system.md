##### Ovaries and oviducts
The **ovary** in a female produces [[#Ova|ova]] (the female gametes) and <u>female sex hormones</u>.

The **oviducts** are thin-walled <u>muscular tubes</u> with funnel-shaped opening near the ovary to <u>receive the ovum</u>. Its inner wall is lined with <u>ciliated epithelium</u>, <span style="color: lightgreen">the beating action of the cilia and wave-like muscular contractions of the oviduct move the ovum along the tube</u>. [[Sexual intercourse and fertilization#Fertilization|Fertilization]] usually occurs in the oviducts.

##### Uterus, uterine lining and cervix
The **uterus** is a thick-walled <u>muscular organ</u> with soft, smooth inner lining called the **uterine lining**. The embryo attaches to the uterine lining during [[Development of embryo and fetus|pregnancy]]. During pregnancy, the uterus can expand to accommodate the fetus, providing it with protection and a stable environment to develop.

The **cervix** is a ring of muscle located at the lower end of the uterus.

##### Vagina
The **vagina** is a muscular but elastic tube that receives the penis during [[Sexual intercourse and fertilization#Sexual intercourse|sexual intercourse]]. It also serves as the <u>birth canal</u> through which the baby is born.

#### Ova
##### Structure
![[ova.webp]]
**Ova** are spherical cells about 0.1 mm in diameter.

- The **cell membrane** is covered by a protective **jelly coat**.

- The cytoplasm contains **food reserves (yolk)** which nourish the developing embryo for about two weeks after fertilization. This makes the ovum much larger than the sperm.

- The **nucleus** is large and contains a haploid number of chromosomes.

##### Production
![[ova_production.webp|300]]
Thousands of potential ova are already present in a baby girl before birth, and remain immature until puberty. Each immature ovum is surrounded by follicle cells, forming a follicle.

Starting from puberty, female sex hormones are secreted to stimulate follicles and immature ova within them to develop. One mature ovum is released from one of the ovaries each month, about 500 ova would become mature and be released during the lifetime of a female.

> [!note]
> Sometime, an ovary releases more than one egg during the same menstrual cycle. This is referred to as hyperovulation. If they are both fertilized by a sperm, it can lead to fraternal twins.
