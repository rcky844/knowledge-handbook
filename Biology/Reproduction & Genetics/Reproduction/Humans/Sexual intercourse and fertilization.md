#### Sexual intercourse
1. The male is sexually stimulated (arousal).
2. More blood is pumped into his penis (dilation of blood vessels) and the outflow of blood is reduced.
3. Erectile tissues inside the penis are filled with blood. Penis becomes hard and rigid.
4. Now, it can be inserted into the vagina of a female for sexual intercourse.
5. Eventually, muscular contractions of the epididymis, sperm ducts and urethra expel semen out of the penis. The discharge of semen through the penis is called ejaculation.

#### Fertilization

> [!note]
> Only a few hundred sperms will reach the oviducts. This is because:
> - Some sperms are <u>trapped by mucus</u> in the vagina.
> - Some sperms are <u>killed by the acidic secretion</u> of the vagina.
> - Some sperms may be <u>defective and immotile</u>.

- Sperms will try to penetrate an ovum.
- Enzymes are released from their acrosomes to breakdown the jelly coat of the ovum.
- Once the head of a sperm enters the ovum, the jelly coat changes to prevent other sperms from entering.
- Finally, the nucleus of the sperm fuses with the nucleus of the ovum, forming a zygote.
