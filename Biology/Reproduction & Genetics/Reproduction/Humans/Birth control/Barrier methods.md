#### Condoms
**Condoms** trap semen in the end of the condom to prevent sperms from entering the vagina. Some condoms are coated with <u>spermicide</u>, which is a chemical that kills sperms. They have a failure rate of about 15%, as they may break and leak if not used correctly.

There exists **male condoms** that is rolled over the erect penis before intercourse, and **female condoms** that are put into the vagina before intercourse to catch semen.

**Condoms** can also protect against sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. gonorrhoea and AIDS) and urinary tract infections, as the use of condoms can reduce the contact of body fluids (e.g. semen and vaginal secretions) from infected persons.

#### Diaphragms

**Diaphragms** are dome-shaped cap with an elastic rim that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse. It fits over the cervix so that the sperms cannot enter the uterus, and has a failure rate of about 10%.

After intercourse, it must be left in place for six to eight hours. It is usually used together with spermicide.
