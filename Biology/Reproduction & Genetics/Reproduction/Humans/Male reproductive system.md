## Testes and scrotum
The **testes** produces [[#Sperms|sperms]] (<span class="hi-blue">male gametes</span>) and [[#Production|male sex hormones]] (e.g. testosterone).

The **scrotum** <u>hangs outside the abdominal cavity</u> in order to <span class="hi-green">keep the temperature inside slightly lower than the body temperature</span> (by ~2Â°C), which is essential for sperms to <span class="hi-green">develop properly</span> in the testes.

## Epididymis, sperm duct and urethra
The **epididymis** is a <u>tightly coiled duct lying outside the testes</u>. It <span class="hi-green">stores sperms temporarily</span> and <span class="hi-green">allows sperms to become mature and motile</span>.

The **sperm ducts**, or **vas deferens**, transfer sperms from the epididymis to the urethra during [[Sexual intercourse and fertilization#Sexual intercourse|ejaculation]].

The **urethra** carriers semen and urine out of the body.

## Accessory glands
The **accessory glands** are a series of glands that <span class="hi-green">secretes seminal fluid</span>, which includes the <span class="hi-blue">seminal vesicles, prostate gland and Cowper's glands</span>. Seminal fluid mixes with sperms during [[Sexual intercourse and fertilization#Sexual intercourse|ejaculation]] to form semen.

The functions of seminal fluid are listed below:
- It <span class="hi-green">contains nutrients</span> (e.g. sugars; fructose) which <span class="hi-green">nourish the sperms</span>.
- It provides a <span class="hi-green">liquid medium</span> through which <span class="hi-green">sperms can swim</span>.
- It <span class="hi-green">neutralizes the acidic secretions of the female's vagina</span>.

## Penis
The **penis** contains <span class="hi-green">spongy erectile tissues</span> and <span class="hi-green">many blood vessels</span>. It becomes erect when sexually stimulated so that it can be inserted into the vagina for [[Sexual intercourse and fertilization#Sexual intercourse|sexual intercourse]].

> [!note]
> The penis is similar in function to the [[Fertilization in flowering plants|pollen tube]] in flowering plants as they both bring the male gametes closer to the female gametes.

# Sperms
## Structure
![[sperms.webp]]
**Sperms** are tadpole shaped male gametes about 0.06 mm in length. It comprises of three distinct regions:

- The <span class="hi-blue">head</span>, which has a nucleus with a haploid number of chromosomes.
  In front of the nucleus is a cap-like structure called the <span class="hi-blue">acrosome</span>, it contains enzymes that help the sperm penetrate an ovum.
- The <span class="hi-blue">midpiece</span> is packed with numerous <u>mitochondria</u> to <u>carry out aerobic respiration</u> to supply energy for the movements of the tail.
- The <span class="hi-blue">tail</span> brings about <span class="hi-green">movements to propel</span> the sperm forward.

## Production
![[sperm_production.webp|600]]

Starting from <u>puberty</u>, male sex hormones stimulate the cells in the walls of seminiferous tubules to produce sperms through [[meiotic cell division]]. The newly formed sperms are passed into the epididymis, where they are stored temporarily, and become mature and motile.

Sperm production occurs continuously, producing more than 100 million sperms daily well into old age.
