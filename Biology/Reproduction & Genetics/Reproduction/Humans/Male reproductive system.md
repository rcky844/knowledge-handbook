##### Testes and scrotum
The **testes** produces [[#Sperms|sperms]] (<span style="color: aqua">male gametes</span>) and [[#Production|male sex hormones]] (e.g. testosterone).

The **scrotum** <span style="color: lightgreen">hangs outside the abdominal cavity</span> in order to <span style="color: aqua">keep the temperature inside slightly lower than the body temperature</span> (by ~2Â°C), which is essential for sperms to <span style="color: orange">develop properly</span> in the testes.

##### Epididymis, sperm duct and urethra
The **epididymis** is a <span style="color: lightgreen">tightly coiled duct lying outside the testes</span>. It <span style="color: peachpuff">stores sperms temporarily</span> and <span style="color: peachpuff">allows sperms to become mature and motile</span>.

The **sperm ducts**, or **vas deferens**, transfer sperms from the epididymis to the urethra during [[Sexual intercourse and fertilization#Sexual intercourse|ejaculation]].

The **urethra** carriers semen and urine out of the body.

##### Accessory glands
The **accessory glands** are a series of glands that <span style="color: lightgreen">secretes seminal fluid</span>, which includes the <span style="color: violet">seminal vesicles, prostate gland and Cowper's glands</span>. Seminal fluid mixes with sperms during [[Sexual intercourse and fertilization#Sexual intercourse|ejaculation]] to form semen.

The functions of seminal fluid are listed below:
- It <span style="color: peachpuff">contains nutrients</span> (e.g. sugars; fructose) which <span style="color: peachpuff">nourish the sperms</span>.
- It provides a <span style="color: peachpuff">liquid medium</span> through which <span style="color: peachpuff">sperms can swim</span>.
- It <span style="color: peachpuff">neutralizes the acidic secretions of the female's vagina</span>.

##### Penis
The **penis** contains <span style="color: lightgreen">spongy erectile tissues</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">many blood vessels</span>. It becomes erect when sexually stimulated so that it can be inserted into the vagina for [[Sexual intercourse and fertilization#Sexual intercourse|sexual intercourse]].

> [!note]
> The penis is similar in function to the [[Fertilization in flowering plants|pollen tube]] in flowering plants as they both bring the male gametes closer to the female gametes.

#### Sperms
##### Structure
![[sperms.webp]]
**Sperms** are tadpole shaped male gametes about 0.06 mm in length. It comprises of three distinct regions:

- The **head**, which has a nucleus with a haploid number of chromosomes.
  In front of the nucleus is a cap-like structure called the **acrosome**, it contains enzymes that help the sperm penetrate an ovum.

- The **midpiece** is packed with numerous <u>mitochondria</u> to <u>carry out aerobic respiration</u> to supply energy for the movements of the tail.

- The **tail** brings about movements to propel the sperm forward.

##### Production
![[sperm_production.webp|600]]

Starting from <u>puberty</u>, male sex hormones stimulate the cells in the walls of seminiferous tubules to produce sperms through [[meiotic cell division]]. The newly formed sperms are passed into the epididymis, where they are stored temporarily, and become mature and motile.

Sperm production occurs continuously, producing more than 100 million sperms daily well into old age.
