**Asexual reproduction** is the production of offspring from <span style="color: lightgreen">one single parent without the fusion of gametes</span>. It involves [[mitotic cell division]] only, all offspring have <span style="color: aqua">identical genetic make-up as the parent</span>.

#### Examples
##### Binary fission in bacteria
**Binary fission** is commonly carried out in <u>prokaryotes</u> (e.g. bacteria) and certain <u>unicellular eukaryotes</u> (e.g. *Amoeba* & *Paramecium*).

##### Vegetative propagation in flowering plants
**Vegetative propagation** occurs in flowering plants where a <span style="color: lightgreen">new plant develops from the vegetative parts</span> (e.g. stems, roots or leaves) of the parent plant through fragmentation and regeneration.

Vegetative parts of plants form <span style="color: violet">storage organs</span> underground, swollen with food reserves (usually starch), for vegetative propagation.
