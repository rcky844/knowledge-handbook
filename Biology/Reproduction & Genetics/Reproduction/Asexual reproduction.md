**Asexual reproduction** is the production of offspring from one single parent <u>without the fusion of gametes</u>. It involves [[mitotic cell division]] only, all offspring have <u>identical genetic make-up as the parent</u>.

#### Examples of asexual reproduction
##### Binary fission in bacteria
**Binary fission** is commonly carried out in <u>prokaryotes</u> (e.g. bacteria) and certain <u>unicellular eukaryotes</u> (e.g. *Amoeba* & *Paramecium*).

##### Vegetative propagation in flowering plants
**Vegetative propagation** occurs in plants in which a new plant develops from the vegetative parts (e.g. stems, roots or leaves) of the parent plant through fragmentation and regeneration.

Vegetative parts of plants form storage organs underground, swollen with food reserves (usually starch), for vegetative propagation.

##### Others
- **Budding in yeast and *Hydra***
  The parent develops an outgrowth (bud), which grows larger and eventually breaks off as an offspring that is smaller than the parent, but is genetically identical to the parent.

- **Spore formation in fungi** (e.g. Bread mould)
  Reproduces by forming spores which can be carried over long distances by wind and will develop into a new fungus under suitable conditions.
