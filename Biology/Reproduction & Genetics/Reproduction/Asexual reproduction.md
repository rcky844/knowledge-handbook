**Asexual reproduction** is the production of offspring from one single parent <u>without the fusion of gametes</u>. It involves [[mitotic cell division]] only, all offspring have <u>identical genetic make-up as the parent</u>.

#### Examples of asexual reproduction
##### Binary fission in bacteria


##### Vegetative propagation in flowering plants


##### Others
- **Budding in yeast and *Hydra***
  The parent develops an outgrowth (bud), which grows larger and eventually breaks off as an offspring that is smaller than the parent, but is genetically identical to the parent.

- **Spore formation in fungi** (e.g. Bread mould)
  Reproduces by forming spores which can be carried over long distances by wind and will develop into a new fungus under suitable conditions.
