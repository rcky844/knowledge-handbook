**Sexual reproduction** is the production of offspring through the <span class="hi-green">fusion of gametes</span> (fertilization). These gametes are usually derived from two parents of different sexes and produced by [[meiotic cell division]].

Upon fertilization, a <span class="hi-blue">zygote</span> is formed. It then undergoes [[mitotic cell division]] into an offspring.
