**Sexual reproduction** is the production of offspring through the fusion of gametes (fertilization). These gametes are usually derived from two parents of different sexes and produced by meiotic cell division.

Upon fertilization, a zygote is formed. It then undergoes mitotic cell division into an offspring.

Currently in the Knowledge Handbook, there are two major types of sexual reproduction covered:

- [[Sexual reproduction in flowering plants]]
- [[Sexual reproduction in humans]]
