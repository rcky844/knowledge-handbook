1. When a pollen grain reaches a stigma, it is stimulated by the sugary solution on the stigma to develop a <u>pollen tube</u>.
2. The pollen tube secretes enzymes to digest tissues of the style and the ovary, bringing the male gamete towards the ovule through the micropyle.
3. The male gamete is released into the ovule and fuses with the female gamete, forming a zygote.
