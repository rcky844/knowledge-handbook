1. When a pollen grain reaches a stigma, it is stimulated by the sugary solution on the stigma to develop a <span style="color: skyblue">pollen tube</span>.
2. The pollen tube <u>secretes enzymes to digest tissues of the style and the ovary</u>, bringing the male gamete towards the ovule through the micropyle.
3. The male gamete is released into the ovule and fuses with the female gamete, forming a zygote.
