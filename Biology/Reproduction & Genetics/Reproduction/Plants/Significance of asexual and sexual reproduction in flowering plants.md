> [!note] Summary
> - Some flowering plants can carry out [[asexual reproduction]] under favourable conditions. The plants can produce a large number of offspring in a short period of time.
> - Flowering plants usually carry out [[sexual reproduction]] under unfavourable conditions. The plants can produce offspring with more genetic variations. Some offspring may be able to survive better in changed conditions, this increases the chance of survival for the species.

#### Asexual reproduction
*Main article: [[Asexual reproduction]]*
##### Advantages
- **Fast** — one parent plant can <u>produce a large number of offspring</u> under favourable conditions.
- **Desirable characteristics** of the parent are retained in the offspring.
- **Large amounts of food reserves** are available in <u>storage organs for the growth</u> of the offspring.

##### Disadvantages
- All offspring are identical and there is **no genetic variation**.
  The species is <u>less able to adapt to environmental changes</u>.
- **Overcrowding** may occur because all offspring are near to the parent plant.
  This lead to <u>intense competition for resources</u>.
- The chance for **disease transmission** from parent plants to offspring is <u>higher</u>.

#### Sexual reproduction
*Main article: [[Sexual reproduction]]
##### Advantages
- **Genetic variation** exists among offspring. This allows the species to <u>adapt to environmental changes</u>.
- Fruits and seeds are usually <u>dispersed away from the parent plants</u>. This can **prevent overcrowding** and <u>reduce competition</u> for resources.
- The **chance of disease transmission** from parent plants to offspring is <u>lower</u>.

##### Disadvantages
- **Slower** — <u>two parents</u> are involved and <u>external agents</u> are required.
- Large amounts of **resources and energy** are required in **producing flowers and fruits**, and <u>many seeds are wasted if conditions for germination are poor</u>.
- Seeds only contain **limited food reserves** to <u>support growth</u> of offspring.
