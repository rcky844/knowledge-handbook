In the **dispersal of seeds and fruits**, <span class="hi-blue">external agents</span> (e.g. animals, wind, water) are often required.

This process is important because it <span class="hi-green">avoids overcrowding</span>, while also allowing the plant species to colonize new areas.

# Examples of the methods for dispersal
## By animals
- **Use of brightly coloured, fleshy and scented fruits** (e.g. tomatoes)
  <span class="hi-green">Attract animals to feed on</span>, then discarding or swallowing the seeds.

- **Swallowed seeds**
  Seeds are usually <span class="hi-blue">small and have hard seed coats</span> to <span class="hi-green">withstand the actions of digestive enzymes</span>. By the time they are expelled in animals' faeces, the <span class="hi-blue">seed coats are softened</span>.

- **Hooks or spines**
  These structures allow the fruit to <span class="hi-green">stick to the fur of animals</span>.
  (e.g. burdock fruits can cling to the fur of dogs)

## By wind
Some plants produce fruits that are <u>very light</u>, and <span class="hi-green">has structures to act as 'parachutes' or 'wings' to float or glide in the wind</span>. They can be dispersed by wind.
(e.g. dandelion, sugar maple)

This method of dispersal allows them to transport seeds or fruits <span class="hi-green">over long distances</span>.

## By water
Fruits of some freshwater and coastal plants depend on water for dispersal.
For example, coconut fruit has <span class="hi-blue">air spaces</span> that allow it to <span class="hi-green">float</span> and be dispersed by water currents.

## By 'explosion'
Seeds of pea pods are distributed by this method:
- When pea pods are mature, their fruit walls dry up and shrink.
- This gradually <span class="hi-green">builds up pressure</span> within the pods, eventually causing the pods to 'explode', scattering the seeds away.
