In the **dispersal of seeds and fruits**, <span style="color: violet">external agents</span> (e.g. animals, wind, water) are often required.

This process is important because it <span style="color: lightgreen">avoids overcrowding</span>, while also allowing the plant species to colonize new areas.

#### Examples of the methods for dispersal
##### By animals
- **Use of brightly coloured, fleshy and scented fruits** (e.g. tomatoes)
  <span style="color: lightgreen">Attract animals to feed on</span>, then discarding or swallowing the seeds.

- **Swallowed seeds**
  Seeds are usually <span style="color: lightgreen">small and have hard seed coats</span> to <span style="color: aqua">withstand the actions of digestive enzymes</span>. By the time they are expelled in animals' faeces, the <span style="color: orange">seed coats are softened</span>.

- **Hooks or spines**
  These structures allow the fruit to <span style="color: lightgreen">stick to the fur of animals</span>.
  (e.g. burdock fruits can cling to the fur of dogs)

##### By wind
Some plants produce fruits that are <u>very light</u>, and <u>has structures to act as 'parachutes' or 'wings' to float or glide in the wind</u>. They can be dispersed by wind.
(e.g. dandelion, sugar maple)

This method of dispersal allows them to transport seeds or fruits over long distances.

##### By water
Fruits of some freshwater and coastal plants depend on water for dispersal.
For example, coconut fruit has <u>air spaces</u> that allow it to <u>float</u> and be dispersed by water currents.

##### By 'explosion'
Seeds of pea pods are distributed by this method:
- When pea pods are mature, their fruit walls dry up and shrink.
- This gradually builds up pressure within the pods, eventually causing the pods to 'explode', scattering the seeds away.
