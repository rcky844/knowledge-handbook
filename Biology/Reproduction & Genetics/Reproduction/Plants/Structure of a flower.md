#### Sepals, petals & nectaries
- **Sepals** are the <span style="color: lightgreen">outermost ring of a flower</span>. It makes up the <span style="color: violet">calyx</span>. They are leaf-like structures and are usually green, protecting the flower bud.
- **Petals** are the second ring of a flower. It makes up the <span style="color: violet">corolla</span>. In many flowers, it is brightly coloured and scented to attract insects. There are <span style="color: skyblue">insects guides</span> (lines or marks) to direct insects to the <span style="color: skyblue">nectaries</span>.
- **Nectaries** are glands that produce <span style="color: skyblue">nectar</span>, a sugary liquid insects feed on.

#### Stamens & anthers
**Stamens** are the <span style="color: lightgreen">male reproductive parts</span>. Each stamen has a filament (a thin stalk) that supports an <span style="color: violet">anther</span> at its tip.

An **anther** consists of <span style="color: skyblue">four pollen sacs</span> where [[meiotic cell division]] occurs to produce <span style="color: orange">pollen grains</span>, containing the male gametes. When the anther is ripe, the pollen sacs split open, exposing their pollen grains.

> [!warning]
> <u>Pollen grains are not the male gametes</u>, they act as structures that facilitates the male gametes to reach the female gametes.

#### Carpels
![[carpels.webp|400]]
**Carpels** are the <span style="color: lightgreen">female reproductive parts</span>.

- The **stigma** is the tip of a carpel that receives <span style="color: skyblue">pollen grains</span>. <span style="color: lightgreen">A mature stigma may secrete a sugary solution to pick up pollen.</span>
- The **style** is a stalk that connects the stigma to the ovary.
- The **ovary** encloses one or more <span style="color: skyblue">ovules</span> that contain the female gametes of <span style="color: skyblue">ova</span>.
	- The **ovule** is connected to the inner wall of the ovary by a short stalk called **funicle**, and is surrounded by **integuments** (a protective layer). There are tiny holes in the integuments called **micropyle**.

> In bisexual flowers, there exists both stamens and carpels.
> Flowers containing either stamens or carpels only are called unisexual flowers.
