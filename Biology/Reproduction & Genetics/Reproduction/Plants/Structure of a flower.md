#### Sepals
**Sepals** are the outermost ring of a flower. It makes up the <u>calyx</u>.
They are leaf-like structures and are usually green, protecting the flower bud.

#### Petals
**Petals** are the second ring of a flower. It makes up the <u>corolla</u>.
In many flowers, it is brightly coloured and scented to attract insects. There are also special lines or marks called <u>insects guides</u> to direct insects to the <u>nectaries</u>.

**Nectaries** are glands that produce nectar, a sugary liquid insects feed on.

#### Stamens
**Stamens** are the <u>male reproductive parts</u>. Each stamen has a filament (a thin stalk that supports a anther at its tip).

An anther consists of <u>four pollen sacs</u> where [[meiotic cell division]] occurs to produce pollen grains, containing the male gametes. When the anther is ripe, the pollen sacs split open, exposing their pollen grains.

#### Carpels
![[carpels.webp|400]]
**Carpels** are the <u>female reproductive parts</u>.

- The **stigma** is the tip of a carpel that receives pollen grains. A mature stigma may secrete a sugary solution to pick up pollen.
- The **style** is a stalk that connects the stigma to the ovary.
- The **ovary** encloses one or more ovules that contain the female gametes of ova.
	- The **ovule** is connected to the inner wall of the ovary by a short stalk called **funicle**, and is surrounded by **integuments** (a protective layer). There are tiny hoes in the integuments called **micropyle**.

> **Note**:
> In bisexual flowers, there exists both stamens and carpels.
> Flowers containing either stamens or carpels only are called unisexual flowers.
