1. Under <span class="hi-green">adverse conditions</span> (e.g. cold winder), the aerial part of the plant dies, the storage organ remains <span class="hi-blue">dormant</span>.

2. Under <span class="hi-green">favourable conditions</span>, a bud grows and develops a new shoot and adventitious roots using the <span class="hi-blue">food reserves</span> in the storage organ.

3. Green leaves carry out [[photosynthesis]] and passes down some of the food to form new storage organs.
