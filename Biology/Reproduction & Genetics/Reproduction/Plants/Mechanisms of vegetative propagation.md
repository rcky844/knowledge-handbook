1. Under <span style="color: lightgreen">adverse conditions</span> (e.g. cold winder), the aerial part of the plant dies, the storage organ remains <span style="color: violet">dormant</span>.

2. Under <span style="color: lightgreen">favourable conditions</span>, a bud grows and develops a new shoot and adventitious roots using the <span style="color: orange">food reserves</span> in the storage organ.
