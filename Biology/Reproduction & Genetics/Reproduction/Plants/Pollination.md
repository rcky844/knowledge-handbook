# Self-pollination & Cross-pollination
**Self-pollination** occurs when pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of the <span class="hi-green">same flower</span>, or <span class="hi-green">another flower of the same plant</span>.
 - This can increase the chances of fertilization when a plant species is <span class="hi-green">rare</span> or its <span class="hi-green">members are separated by long distances</span>.
 - However, it results in <span class="hi-green">inbreeding</span> and <span class="hi-green">less genetic variation</span>.

**Cross-pollination** occurs when pollen grains are transferred from the anther of one plant to the stigma of a flower in <span class="hi-green">another plant of the same species</span>.
- This results in <span class="hi-green">more genetic variations</span> among the offspring, as the gametes from two different parents are brought together.
- Some offspring may have <span class="hi-green">characteristics that enable them to survive environmental changes better</span>, increasing the chance of survival of the species.

# Insect pollination and wind pollination
**Insect-pollinated flowers** have their pollen grains pollinated by insects.

**Wind-pollinated flowers** have their pollen grains pollinated by wind.
