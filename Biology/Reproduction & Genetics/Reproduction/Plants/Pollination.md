#### Self-pollination & Cross-pollination
**Self-pollination** occurs when pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of the <u>same flower</u>, or <u>another flower of the same plant</u>.
 - This can increase the chances of fertilization when a plant species is <u>rare</u> of its <u>members are separated by long distances</u>.
 - However, it results in <u>inbreeding</u> and <u>less genetic variation</u>.

**Cross-pollination** occurs when pollen grains are transferred from the anther of one plant to the stigma of a flower in <u>another plant of the same species</u>.
- This results in more genetic variations among the offspring, as the gametes from two different parents are brought together.
- Some offspring may have characteristics that enable them to survive environmental changes better, increasing the chance of survival of the species.

#### Insect pollination and wind pollination
**Insect-pollinated flowers** have their pollen grains pollinated by insects.

**Wind-pollinated flowers** have their pollen grains pollinated by wind.
