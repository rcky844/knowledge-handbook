**Speciation** depends on two factors: <span class="hi-blue">isolation</span> and <span class="hi-blue">genetic variation</span>.

- **Isolation of populations of species**
  [[Evolution disruptions#Gene flow|Gene flow]] is stopped between the isolated groups as they <u>cannot reach or breed with each other</u>.

- **Mutations and genetic variations**
  Genetic variations may exist between isolated populations of species. Moreover, the isolated groups may each <u>face different selection pressure (different environmental conditions), different favourable alleles are passed on to offspring in each isolated group</u>.

- **Accumulation of variations**
  Variations accumulate in each isolated group over many generations. When the population evolve enough genetic change that it can no longer interbreed to produce fertile offspring, it is considered as a new species.

# Types of isolation
![[isolation_types.webp]]

- **Geographical isolation**
  Separation of populations by physical barriers prevent mating.

- **Behavioural isolation**
  Organism has a behaviour that is considered unfavourable and chooses not to mate.

- **Temporal isolation**
  The mating times of the organisms do not match up.
