**Comparative anatomy** studies similarities and differences in <span style="color: lightgreen">physical structures</span> of different organisms.

Based on the [[Evolution#Theory of evolution|theory of evolution]], it is expected that different species that evolved from a common ancestor <u>share certain structures similar to the common ancestor</u>.

**Homologous structures** are <span style="color: lightgreen">anatomically similar structures with similar body position</span> that evolved from a common ancestor.
- An example is the <span style="color: skyblue">pentadactyl limb</span> (five-fingered limb) in mammals.
  ![[pentadactyl_limb.webp|500]]
- As the organisms evolve, the <u>homologous structure have adapted to suit their ways of life</u>.
