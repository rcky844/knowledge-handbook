**Comparative molecular biology** studies similarities and differences between organisms in their DNA, proteins and other biomolecules.

#### Comparing base sequences of DNA
Organisms that share <u>more
similarities</u> in the base sequences of DNA have a <u>closer evolutionary / phylogenetic relationship</u>.

> [!note]
> - Base sequences of DNA determines the characteristics of organisms.
> - Mutations affect the amino sequence of protein produced and may result in change in characteristics.
> ↪️ See also: [[Mutations]]

#### Comparing amino acid sequences of essential proteins
Certain essential proteins are commonly found in many different organisms, but may be slightly different as a result of [[mutations]].

Scientists assume that <u>the fewer the number of amino acid differences</u> of a protein found in different organisms, <u>the more closely related the organisms are</u>.

**Example**: Amino acid sequence of haemoglobin molecule
