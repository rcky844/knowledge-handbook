**Comparative molecular biology** studies similarities and differences between organisms in their DNA, proteins and other biomolecules.

#### Comparing base sequences of DNA
Organisms that share <span style="color: lightgreen">more
similarities</span> in the base sequences of DNA have a <span style="color: lightgreen">closer evolutionary / phylogenetic relationship</span>.

> [!note]
> - Base sequences of DNA determines the characteristics of organisms.
> - Mutations affect the amino sequence of protein produced and may result in change in characteristics.

#### Comparing amino acid sequences of essential proteins
Certain essential proteins are commonly found in many different organisms, but may be slightly different as a result of [[mutations]].

It is assumed that <span style="color: lightgreen">the fewer the number of amino acid differences</span> of a protein found in different organisms, <span style="color: lightgreen">the more closely related the organisms are</span>.

**Example**: Amino acid sequence of haemoglobin molecule
