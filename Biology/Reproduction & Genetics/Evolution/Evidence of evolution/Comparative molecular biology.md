**Comparative molecular biology** studies similarities and differences between organisms in their <span style="color: lightgreen">DNA, proteins and other biomolecules</span>.

#### Comparing base sequences of DNA
Organisms that share <span style="color: lightgreen">more
similarities</span> in the base sequences of DNA have a <span style="color: lightgreen">closer evolutionary / phylogenetic relationship</span>.

> [!note]
> - Base sequences of DNA determines the characteristics of organisms.
> - Mutations affect the amino sequence of protein produced and may result in changes in characteristics.

#### Comparing amino acid sequences of essential proteins
Certain essential proteins are commonly found in many different organisms, but may be slightly different as a result of [[mutations]].

An organism with <span style="color: lightgreen">fewer numbers of amino acid differences</span> of a protein compared to another organism shows that they are <span style="color: lightgreen">more closely related</span>.

**Example**: Amino acid sequence of haemoglobin molecule
