**Fossils** are <span style="color: lightgreen">preserved remains of organisms</span>. They provide information about the morphology of organisms living in the past.

**Formation of fossils**:
- Burial of dead organisms in <span style="color: violet">sediments</span>
- Preservation of dead organisms by <span style="color: violet">freezing</span> (in permafrost)
- Organisms <span style="color: violet">trapped in resin</span>

#### Fossil records and evolution
For fossils found in sedimentary rocks:
![[fossils_sediment.webp|350]]

Comparing layer 1 and 3, layer 1 consists of fossils of organisms that:
- Appeared later on Earth
- More complex in structure

**Uses for determining evolutionary relationships**:
- By comparing <span style="color: orange">anatomy</span> of organisms
- By comparing <span style="color: orange">morphology</span> of organisms
- Determining <span style="color: orange">chronological order of existence</span> of organisms

**Dating of fossil layers**:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Radioisotope dating</span> (carbon-14 dating) can be used to arrange fossils in a chronological sequence.

#### Evidence for evolution
- **Fossils show similarities to living species.**
  ↪️ This indicate <span style="color: lightgreen">existing life forms arose from pre-existing ones</span>.

- **Fossils in younger rocks show a greater diversity of fossils.**
  ↪️ This indicate that <span style="color: lightgreen">different types of organisms have evolved from a common ancestor</span>.

- **Fossils in younger rocks are more complex than those in older rocks.**
  ↪️ This indicate that <span style="color: lightgreen">organisms evolved from simple to complex forms</span> as simple organisms adapted to become more complex.

#### Limitations of using fossil records
1. **There are missing links within the fossil records.**
   There is a <span style="color: lightgreen">lack of a continuous fossil record of all the <u>intermediate forms</u></span> between ancient species and modern species.

2. **Fossils can be damaged and incomplete.**
   Natural processes (e.g. erosion, movement of Earth's crust) may damage fossils, leaving only <span style="color: violet">incomplete fragments</span>.

3. **Some organisms may not be fossilized.**
   <span style="color: lightgreen">Organisms with soft bodies cannot be fossilized</span>, while some other organisms die in conditions not favourable for fossil formation (e.g. dead bodies in rainforests decay rapidly).

4. **Some fossils are trapped in inaccessible areas.**
   Fossils can be trapped deep under the sea due to the movement of Earth's crust, making them unavailable for studying.
