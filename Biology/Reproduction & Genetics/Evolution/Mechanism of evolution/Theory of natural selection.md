Charles Darwin proposed the theory of natural selection and survival of the fittest.

1. **Individuals compete for limited resources (e.g. food, water and shelter).**
   Most organisms tend to produce <u>more offspring than needed to replace themselves</u>. However, the <u>number of individuals in a population remains relatively constant</u>.

2. **There are genetic variations among individuals of the same species.** (\*)
   Individuals with variations <u>favourable to their environment have a <span style="color: orange">greater chance</span> to survive and reproduce</u>. ("survival of the fittest")
   ↪️ See also: [[Variations in characteristics#Sources of variations|Sources of genetic variations]]

3. **Some genetic variations are inheritable and can be passed on to offspring.** (\*)
   The <span style="color: lightgreen">variations accumulate</span> through many generations. <u>Individuals with favourable characteristics become <span style="color: orange">more frequent</span> in the population</u>. The organism has evolved and become different from its ancestor.

4. **Environmental changes give stresses to organisms.**
   <span style="color:skyblue">Selection pressure</span> (the changes in condition) favours a particular form of the species. They have a <span style="color:skyblue">selective advantage</span> to survive and reproduce more successfully.

↪️ The proportion of the favoured form increases in subsequent generations, while proportion of the less-well-adapted form decreases.

> [!note]
> Bacteria have a short generation time and reproduce very quickly. The amount of time required for developing antibiotic resistance is shorter, as each cell division may create mutations from DNA replication or damage by mutagens.
