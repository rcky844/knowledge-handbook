**Gene pool** is the total of all alleles in all individuals in a population. In **evolution disruptions**, the gene pool of a population is changed.

# Gene flow
**Gene flow** is the movement of alleles into or out of a population.

**Gene flow** introduces new alleles into a gene pool or change allele frequencies, creating less differences between populations.

# Genetic drift
**Genetic drift** is the change in allele frequencies as a result of chance. It usually occurs due to natural disasters.

**Genetic drift** impact small populations greatly, as there is a greater chance that a rare allele will be lost.

# Mutations
*See also: [[Mutations]]*

**Mutations** can produce totally new alleles for a trait.

**Mutations** can be neutral, harmful or beneficial. If the new trait is beneficial (helps organisms to survive), they will have a <span class="hi-blue">selective advantage</span> and becomes more frequent in the population.

# Natural selection
*See also: [[Theory of natural selection]]*

By **natural selection**, the <u>allele frequency of the favoured form increases</u> within the gene pool.

Better adapted individuals to their environment can survive and reproduce, passing on beneficial genes to the offspring and increases the frequency of beneficial alleles in the population.

# Non-random mating
Individuals have a choice in who they mate with, the process is not random.
