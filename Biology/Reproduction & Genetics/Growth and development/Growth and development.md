**Growth** is the <u>permanent and irreversible increase</u> in the dry mass and size of an organism. In multi cellular organisms, growth involves the following processes:
- Cells carry out mitotic cell division, resulting in an increase in cell number.
- Cells use food substances to synthesize organic matter or biomass, resulting in an increase in cell size.

**Development** is the irreversible increase in complexity (form) of an organism. This involves differentiation, where cells specialize into different types for performing different functions, achieving a division of labour among cells. These specialized cells may also group together to form tissues, organs or systems.
