#### Growth pattern of annual plants
![[growth_annual_plants.webp|400]]

1. Dry mass decreases in the early stages of germination. Some of the stored food is used in respiration to provide energy for growth.

2. Dry mass increases. Green leaves have developed and started to carry out photosynthesis. When the rate of photosynthesis is higher than the rate of respiration, the production of food is faster than the consumption of food. This results in a net gain of organic matter.

3. The dry mass decreases because the plant disperses seeds and fruits.

#### Regions of growth in plants
Growth is restricted to regions with meristems present, which is a group of undifferentiated cells (meristematic cells) that can undergo [[mitotic cell division]] continuously to form new cells.

There are two main types of meristems:
- **Apical meristems**
  They are located at <u>root tips and shoot tips</u>, the cells produced elongate, leading to an increase in the length of the root. Growth as a result of these cells are called <span style="color: violet">primary growth</span>.

- **Lateral meristems**
  Located at the periphery of roots and stems, the cells produced increases its girth (thickness). Growth as a result of these cells are called <span style="color: violet">secondary growth</span>

##### Primary growth

**Region of cell division**:
- Meristematic cells divide actively by [[mitotic cell division]], producing many small, thin-walled cells.
- Most newly formed cells are then pushed to the region or elongation for growth.

**Region of elongation**:
- Most of the growth in the root tip occurs here.
- The cells from the region of cell division absorb water by [[osmosis]], forming many small vacuoles in the cytoplasm which stretches the thin, elastic cell walls, and the cells elongate.

**Region of differentiation**:
- Cell walls elongate as the cells elongate, becoming rigid when the cells cannot elongate further.
- Small vacuoles fuse together to form one large vacuole.
- The cells then differentiate into specialized cells to perform different functions.

##### Secondary growth

Cells of the vascular cambium (a type of lateral meristem) divide and differentiate to form secondary phloem and secondary xylem, increasing the thickness of the stems and roots.
