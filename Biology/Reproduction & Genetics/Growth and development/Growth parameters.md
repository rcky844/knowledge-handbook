#### Dry mass
**Dry mass** is the mass of an organism after <u>all the water has been removed</u> from its body. It is usually obtained by heating the organisms in an oven slightly above 100Â°C, until a constant mass is obtained upon repeated weighing.

**Advantages**:
- It provides an accurate measurement of growth, showing the actual amount of organic matter (biomass) in an organism.

**Disadvantages**:
- It is impossible to make a continuous measurement on the same organism as they are killed. A large number of the same type of organisms are needed in order to measure growth over a period of time.
- It is time-consuming.
- It is impractical to measure the dry mass of large organisms, such as a large tree.

#### Fresh mass
**Fresh mass** is the total mass of an organism, including its water content.

**Advantages**:
- Measuring fresh mass is fast and convenient.
- Repeated measurements can be made on the same organism over a (longer) period of time as it causes no harm to the organisms.

**Disadvantages**:
- Measurement is less accurate and cannot show the actual biomass of the organism as it is easily affected by factors unrelated to growth.

> **Note**:
> Water content varies with environmental factors (e.g. temperature & water supply) and behaviours of the organism (e.g. drinking, feeding and urination).

#### Size
**Size** measures the change in size of the whole organism or of a body structure over a period of time.

**Advantages**:
- Measuring size is fast and convenient.
- Repeated measurements can be made on the same organism or structure over a period of time as it causes no harm to the organism or its body structure.

**Disadvantages**:
- Growth in other dimensions may be neglected as the size of an organism or body structure is often measured in one dimension only.
