# Structure of seeds

> [!note]
> - Dicots (e.g. mung bean) have two cotyledons in their seeds.
> - Monocots (e.g. maize) have only one cotyledon.

# Conditions required for germination
## Water
- It <u>softens the seed coat</u> for the radicle to push out of the seed.
- It causes the <u>cotyledons</u> to <u>swell and ruptures the seed coat</u>.
- It <u>activates enzymes</u> in the cotyledons to <u>hydrolyse the stored food</u> (e.g. starch) into simpler forms by [[Condensation & Hydrolysis|hydrolysis]], which can then be used in respiration to provide energy for growth.
- It provides a medium for transporting the soluble food to the radicle and plumule for growth and development.

## Warmth
- Higher temperatures enable the enzymes to work more efficiently as germination involves enzyme activity.

## Oxygen
- Necessary for the cells in the seed to carry out aerobic respiration in order to release energy for growth.

# Process of seed germination
## Day 1 - 2
![[seed_germd1.webp|200]]

- Water enters the seed through the micropyle.
- The seed coat is ruptured by the swelling of cotyledons.
- Enzymes are activated to break down (hydrolyse) the food reserves into soluble food substances for growth and development.
	- **Food substances involved**:
	  starch → glucose; protein → amino acids; lipids → fatty acids + glycerol
	- Food substances are then transported by water to the growing points of the radicle and plumule for forming new cells.
- The radicle pushes out of the seed, emerging and growing downward to form the root.


## Day 3
![[seed_germd3.webp|200]]

- The radical grows and develops into the root.
- Root hairs develop on the radicle to increase the surface area for absorption of water and minerals.

## Day 4
![[seed_germd4.webp|240]]

- The plumule grows upwards rapidly to form the shoot.
- The hypocotyl (hooked plumble; curved shoot) lifts the cotyledons up above the soil by its rapid growth.
- The cotyledons protect the plumule tip on their way out.

## Day 5
![[seed_germd5.webp|240]]

- The curved shoot beneath the cotyledons straightens once above the soil.
- The cotyledons turn green and carry out photosynthesis for a few days.

## Day 6
![[seed_germd6.webp|260]]

- Green leaves are formed to carry out photosynthesis to make food.
- The cotyledons gradually shrink and fall off.
