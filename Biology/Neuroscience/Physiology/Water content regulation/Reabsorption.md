**Reabsorption** takes place at the <span class="hi-blue">kidney tubule</span>. Useful substances are actively absorbed into the blood via capillaries, while water and urea are absorbed passively into blood.

| Substance | % reabsorbed | Mechanism |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Glucose | 100% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Amino acids | 100% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Salts | 80% | [[Diffusion]] & [[Active transport]] |
| Water | 99% | [[Osmosis]] |
| Urea | 50% | [[Diffusion]] |

- <span class="hi-blue">Glucose, amino acids and some salts</span> in the glomerular filtrate are reabsorbed into the blood by both [[diffusion]] and [[active transport]].

- The reabsorption of glucose, amino acids and salts causes the <span class="hi-blue">glomerular filtrate</span> to <span class="hi-green">become more dilute and its water potential increases</span>. Water in the filtrate moves into blood by [[osmosis]] down a water potential gradient.
	- <span class="hi-green">Amount of water reabsorbed is directly proportional to the amount of solutes reabsorbed.</span> Therefore, the <u>concentration</u> of the filtrate that arrives at the end of the first coiled tubule remains unchanged.

- Reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate <span class="hi-green">raises the concentration of urea</span> (to become higher than in blood) along the tubule, resulting in passive reabsorption of urea into blood by [[diffusion]].

> [!note]
> - Glucose and amino acids are soluble in water, as they can form extensive [[hydrogen bonds]] with water molecules.
> - Glucose and amino acids are completely (and only) reabsorbed in the first coiled tubule. Water, urea, and some salts are reabsorbed even in the collecting duct.
> - For sodium ions, they are always actively reabsorbed. Their presence in blood can affect the water potential of blood.

# Structural adaptations
- The <span class="hi-blue">first coiled tubule</span> is <u>long and highly coiled</u>, <span class="hi-green">increasing surface area</span> and allowing more time for reabsorption.
- The <span class="hi-blue">inner wall of first coiled tubule</span> is lined with <span class="hi-blue">microvilli</span>, <span class="hi-green">increasing surface area</span> for reabsorption.
- The <span class="hi-blue">wall of first coiled tubule</span> is only <u>one-cell thick</u>, and the <span class="hi-blue">tubules</span> are <u>close in contact with blood capillaries</u>, <span class="hi-green">shortening the distance</span> for reabsorption.
- The <span class="hi-blue">cells in the walls of first coiled tubule</span> contain numerous [[mitochondria]], providing a lot of energy for [[active transport]] of useful substances against a concentration gradient.
- Each <span class="hi-blue">kidney tubule</span> is <u>richly supplied with blood capillaries</u>, a <span class="hi-green">steep concentration gradient</span> can be maintained for rapid absorption of substances.

> [!tip]
> The kidneys contain over a million nephrons, this makes the kidneys highly effective in filtering blood and reabsorption.
