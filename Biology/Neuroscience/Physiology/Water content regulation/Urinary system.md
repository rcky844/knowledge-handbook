The **urinary system** is responsible for [[osmoregulation]].

*Kidneys*:
- Receives blood from the aorta through the <span class="hi-blue">renal arteries</span> and return blood to the vena cava through the <span class="hi-blue">renal veins</span>.
- Filters the blood to form urine and leads to <span class="hi-green">osmoregulation and excretion</span>.

*Ureter*:
- Connects the kidneys to the <span class="hi-blue">urinary bladder</span>.

*Urinary bladder*:
- Muscular sac responsible for <span class="hi-green">temporary storage of urine</span>.

*Urethra*:
- Two <span class="hi-blue">sphincter muscles</span> are present to prevent urine from leaking out.
- <span class="hi-blue">Urination</span> is the process that releases urine to the outside of the body.

## Structure of a nephron
![[nephron.webp|600]]

**Nephrons** are responsible for filtering of blood and formation of urine.

*Blood vessels*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Afferent arteriole</span> pump blood into the glomerulus (a network of capillaries).
- <span class="hi-blue">Glomerulus</span> join to form an efferent arteriole leaving the Bowman's capsule.
- <span class="hi-blue">Efferent arteriole</span> leads to another network of capillaries that wraps around the kidney tubule.

*Flow of fluid along the kidney tubule*:
Bowman's capsule → proximal convoluted tubule → loop of Henle → distal convoluted tubule → collecting duct

> [!info]
> - All Bowman's capsules are found in the cortex of the kidney.
> - Collecting ducts drain their contents into the pelvis and then to the ureter.

## Kidney failure and dialysis machines
*Main article: [[Dialysis machines]]*

**Kidney failure** occurs when the half of the kidney function is lost. It can be treated through <span class="hi-blue">haemodialysis</span>.
