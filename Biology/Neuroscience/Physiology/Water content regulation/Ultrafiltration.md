**Ultrafiltration** takes place in the <span class="hi-blue">glomerulus</span>.

# Adaptations
- Blood inside the glomerulus is under <u>high blood pressure</u> due to the <span class="hi-green">pumping action of the heart</span>, which results in <span class="hi-green">high hydrostatic pressure</span> in the glomerulus.
- Capillary wall of the glomerulus and the wall of the Bowman's capsule are <span class="hi-green">thin and differentially permeable</span>. They serve as the <u>filter</u> to allow ultrafiltration.
- The glomerulus has a <span class="hi-green">high surface area</span> for [[diffusion]] due to its capillary network. This allows efficient filtration of blood by <u>maintainining a steep concentration gradient</u> of substances.

> [!note]
> An <span class="hi-green">increase in the blood volume</span> would <span style="color: aqua">increase the hydrostatic pressure</span> in the glomerulus.

# Contents of glomerular filtrate
- **Water and other small molecules in the blood are forced out.**
  Due to the <span class="hi-green">high hydrostatic pressure</span> inside the glomerulus, they are forced out through the walls of the glomerulus and the Bowman's capsule into the <span class="hi-blue">capsular space</span> to form the <span class="hi-blue">glomerular filtrate</span>.

- **Blood cells and plasma proteins are absent in the glomerular filtrate.**
  They are <span class="hi-green">too large to pass through</span> the walls of the glomerulus and the Bowman's capsule.

> [!note]
> - Composition of glomerular filtrate is similar to tissue fluid as they are both formed similarly.
> - About 20% of blood in the glomerulus is filtered and becomes the glomerular filtrate.

> [!danger] Diseases
> - <u>Proteinuria</u> — Urine contains excess proteins, usually caused by <span class="hi-green">damaged glomerular capillaries or Bowman's capsule</span> (which acts as filters). As useful proteins are lost, it may cause edema (build-up of fluid in the body's tissue, causing swelling).
