**Osmoregulation** is the <span class="hi-green">regulation of water content</span> in the body.

*Goals of osmoregulation*:
- Keeping the [[Osmosis|water potential]] of the blood and tissue fluid constant (water balance)
- Maintaining a stable environment for cells to function properly
↪️ Achieved by <u>actively retaining or releasing water</u> in urine

# Mechanism
**Osmoregulation** is controlled by a [[negative feedback mechanism]]. This involves urine production, which is brought about by <span class="hi-blue">antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</span>.

*Details of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)*:
- **Production**: <span class="hi-green">Produced</span> by the <span class="hi-blue">hypothalamus</span> of the brain continuously
- **Release**: <span class="hi-green">Stored and released</span> by the <span class="hi-blue">pituitary gland</span>. Amount of ADH released depends on the <u>changes in water potential of blood</u> detected by <span class="hi-blue">osmoreceptors</span> in the hypothalamus.
- **Effects**: <span class="hi-green">Increases the permeability of the walls of the collecting duct</span> so that the <span class="hi-green">proportion of water reabsorbed along the collecting duct increases</span>.
- **Goal**: Conserve water / Remove excess water

> [!note]
> The release of ADH actually occurs continuously.

## Fall in water potential of blood
- <span class="hi-blue">Osmoreceptors</span> in the <span class="hi-blue">hypothalamus</span> detect a fall in water potential in blood, and <u>signals</u> the <span class="hi-blue">pituitary gland</span> to <u>release more ADH</u>.
- The level of ADH in blood increases.
	- The <span class="hi-green">walls of the collecting ducts become more permeable to water</span>.
	- A <span class="hi-green"><u>larger proportion</u> of water is reabsorbed</span> into the blood by [[osmosis]].
	- A <span class="hi-green"><u>smaller volume</u></span> of <span class="hi-green"><u>concentrated</u> urine</span> is formed.
- The <span class="hi-blue">hypothalamus</span> <u>stimulates the 'thirst centre'</u> in the brain, so the person feel thirsty and drink water.
- The water potential of blood <u>rises</u> and returns to normal.

## Rise in water potential of blood
- <span class="hi-blue">Osmoreceptors</span> in the <span class="hi-blue">hypothalamus</span> detect a rise in water potential in blood, and <u>signals</u> the <span class="hi-blue">pituitary gland</span> to <u>release less ADH</u>.
- The level of ADH in blood decreases.
	- The <span class="hi-green">walls of the collecting ducts become less permeable to water</span>.
	- A <span class="hi-green"><u>smaller proportion</u> of water is reabsorbed</span> into the blood by [[Osmosis]].
	- A <span class="hi-green"><u>larger volume</u></span> of <span class="hi-green"><u>dilute</u> urine</span> is formed.
- The water potential of blood <u>falls</u> and returns to normal.

# Water gain and loss
> [!tip] Processes for water gain and loss
> - **Water gain**: drinks, food, metabolism (e.g. respiration)
> - **Water loss**: exhaled air, sweat, urine, faeces

## Changes in water potential
*Factors*:
- Direct gain/loss of water
- Production of metabolic wastes (e.g. urea) during [[respiration]]
- Glucose level (e.g. absorption, [[diabetes mellitus]])
- Intake of minerals

> [!note]
> As part of <span class="hi-green">osmoregulation</span>, small and soluble substances in blood are also [[Ultrafiltration|filtered]] and end up in the urine produced. This helps to achieve the <span class="hi-blue">salt and water balance</span> of the body.

*Effects*:
- **Regulation by ADH**
  Secretion of ADH is <u>increased/decreased</u> in order to <span class="hi-green">retain/release a larger amount of water in blood</span>.

- **Increased blood volume**
  When the water potential of the cells is higher than that of blood, there will be a net movement of water from body cells to blood by [[osmosis]].

## Intake of drinks
Consider two types of drinks: distilled water, mineralized water
- All drinks increases the volume of blood.
- Distilled water <u>increases</u> the <span class="hi-blue">water potential</span> of blood, this <u>decreases</u> the <span class="hi-blue">secretion of ADH</span> to release water.
	- A <u>larger volume of dilute urine</u> is produced when taking in distilled water, and therefore it is <span class="hi-green">less effective in replenishing water loss / maintaining higher fluid content</span>.
- Mineralized water <u>decreases</u> the <span class="hi-blue">water potential</span> of blood, this <u>increases</u> the <span class="hi-blue">secretion of ADH</span> to retain water, while removing excess salts.
	- A <u>smaller volume of concentrated urine</u> is produced when taking in mineralized water, and therefore it is <span class="hi-green">more effective in replenishing water loss / maintaining higher fluid content</span>.
