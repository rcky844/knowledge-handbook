Regulation of body temperature <u>provides an optimum temperature range</u> for [[enzymes]] to work efficiently in [[Metabolism|metabolic reactions]], maintaining a <u>steady metabolic rate</u>.

**Thermoregulation** involves balancing heat gain and heat loss.
- The <span class="hi-green">body gains most heat internally from metabolic reactions</span>, especially from cellular [[respiration]] in the liver and skeletal muscles.
- The body also gains heat from or loses heat to the environment by <span style="color: violet">conduction, convection and radiation</span>.
- The body also loses heat by the <span style="color: violet">evaporation of sweat</span>.
