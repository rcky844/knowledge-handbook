**Irritability** is the ability of organisms to <span class="hi-green">detect stimuli</span> and produce appropriate responses accordingly. It is important to survival as it enables organisms to escape from danger, and look for food and mates.

# Stimuli and receptors
**Stimuli** are changes in our internal and external environment. They are detected by sensory cells called **receptors**.

Different types of receptors detect different stimuli, some are grouped with other tissues to form a <span class="hi-blue">sense organ</span>. Below lists a few main types of receptors:

| Type of receptor |             Stimulus detected             |                     Sense organ(s)                     |
| :--------------: | :---------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
|  Photoreceptor   |                   Light                   |                   [[Human eye\|Eye]]                   |
| Mechanoreceptor  | Sound (pressure wave)<br>Touch (pressure) | [[Human ear\|Ear]]<br>[[Physical barriers#Skin\|Skin]] |
|  Chemoreceptor   | Chemicals in the air<br>Chemicals in food |                     Nose<br>Tongue                     |
|  Thermoreceptor  |          Changes in temperature           |                          Skin                          |

Receptors convert stimuli into <span class="hi-blue">nerve impulses</span> that travel along a nerve to the <span class="hi-blue">control centre</span> (usually the brain), where they are interpreted as a sensation. The control centre can send nerve impulses to <span class="hi-blue">effectors</span> (e.g. muscles or glands) to produce responses.

# Coordination
![[coordination_flow_chart.webp]]
- **Nervous coordination**: The nervous system coordinates the receptors and effectors, with the brain serving as the control centre.
- **Hormonal coordination**: Coordination is brought about by the endocrine system.
