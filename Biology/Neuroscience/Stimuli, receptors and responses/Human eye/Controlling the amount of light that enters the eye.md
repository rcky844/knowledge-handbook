The pupil is the hole in the centre of the iris, circular muscles and radial muscles of the iris, which its muscles contract or relax to change its size and regulate the amount of light entering the eye. It is a <span class="hi-blue">reflex action</span>.

# In bright light

| :----------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
- **Circular muscles of the iris**: Contract
- **Radial muscles of the iris**: Relax
- **Pupil**: Constricts (becomes smaller)
- **Light entering the eye**: Less
- **Importance**: <span class="hi-green">Prevents excessive light</span> from entering the eye so that the photoreceptors will not be damaged.

# In dim light

| :-------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
- **Circular muscles of the iris**: Relax
- **Radial muscles of the iris**: Contraxt
- **Pupil**: Dilates (becomes larger)
- **Light entering the eye**: More
- **Importance**: <span class="hi-green">Increases stimulation</span> of the photoreceptors to allow us to see in dim light.
