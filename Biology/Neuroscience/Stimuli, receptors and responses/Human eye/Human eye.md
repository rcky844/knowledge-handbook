The **human eye** is a photoreceptor for detecting light. The brain receives the nerve impulses from the eyes and interpret them to produce vision.

# External structures of the eye
The eye is a spherical organ situated in an <span class="hi-blue">orbit</span>, a bony socket in the skull, which encloses and protects all but the front of the eye.

There are three pairs of <span class="hi-blue">eye muscles</span> that attach the eyeball to the wall of the orbit. They contract and relax to allow the eyeball to rotate.

## Structures protecting the front of the eye
- <span class="hi-blue">Eyebrows</span> prevent <span class="hi-blue">sweat</span> from entering the eye.
- <span class="hi-blue">Eyelashes</span> trap <span class="hi-blue">dirt</span> before it can enter the eye.
- <span class="hi-blue">Eyelids</span> can close to protect the eye from <span class="hi-green">foreign objects and strong light</span>.
- <span class="hi-blue">Tear glands</span> is located above the eyeball and <span class="hi-green">secretes tears</span>.
	- When we blink, the eyelids <u>spread tears</u> over the eye surface, keeping it <span class="hi-green">moist and clean</span>.
	- Tears contain an enzyme called <span class="hi-blue">lysozyme</span> to kill bacteria.

# Internal structures of the eye
![[eyeball_structure.webp|550]]

## Outer layer
The <span class="hi-blue">sclera</span> is the white of the eye.
- It is a <u>white, opaque, fibrous coat</u> of the eye, which is very tough so that it <span class="hi-green">gives shape</span> to the eyeball and <span class="hi-green">protects the structures inside</span>.
- It is the surface where the <span class="hi-blue">eye muscles</span> attach to the eyeball.

The <span class="hi-blue">cornea</span> is located in the front part of the eye and is continuous with the sclera.
- It is <span class="hi-green">transparent</span> so that light can enter the eye.
- It has a <span class="hi-green">curved surface</span> that <u>refracts (bends)</u> light.

## Middle layer
The <span class="hi-blue">choroid</span> contains <u>many blood vessels</u> to supply cells of the retina with nutrients and oxygen, and removes carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes produced.
- It is <span class="hi-green">dark in colour</span> because it contains a <span class="hi-blue">black pigment</span> to absorb light. This is to <span class="hi-green">prevent reflection of light</span> in the eye and contributes to sharp vision.

The <span class="hi-blue">ciliary body</span> is a forward continuation of the choroid.
- <span class="hi-blue">Ciliary muscles</span>: Ring of <span class="hi-green">circular muscular</span> tissues that surrounds the edge of the lens.
- <span class="hi-blue">Suspensory ligaments</span>: Connects the <span class="hi-blue">ciliary body</span> with the lens and holds it in place.

The <span class="hi-blue">lens</span> is a <u>transparent, elastic and biconvex</u> structure that helps <span class="hi-green">refract and focus light</span> onto the retina.
- It consists of living cells with <span class="hi-green">no nuclei</span>. This makes them <span class="hi-green">transparent</span> and allows light to pass through without obstruction.
- Its <span class="hi-green">elasticity</span> allow the shape of the lens to be changed when looking at objects from different distances.

> [!note]
> Ciliary muscles in the ciliary body contract or relax to change the tension of suspensory ligaments, and hence the shape of the lens (thickness, curvature) in order to focus light from objects at different distances onto the retina.
> 
> *See also: [[Eye accommodation]]*

The <span class="hi-blue">iris</span> lies in front of the lens and is connected to the ciliary body.
- It contains the <span class="hi-blue">pigment</span> which gives the eye its colour.
- It consists of <span class="hi-blue">circular muscles</span> and <span class="hi-blue">radial muscles</span> with a central hole called the <span class="hi-blue">pupil</span>.
- The pair of muscles change the size of the pupil, [[controlling the amount of light that enters the eye]].

![[iris_pupil.webp|360]]

## Inner layer
The <span class="hi-blue">retina</span> contains two types of photoreceptors (light-sensitive cells), which generate nerve impulses when stimulated by light.
![[rod_cone.webp|400]]

<span class="hi-blue">Rod cells</span> are <span class="hi-green">rod-shaped cells</span> that contain the photosensitive pigment <span class="hi-blue">visual purple</span>, which is very sensitive to light and stimulated by lower light intensities, allowing it to work well in dim light.
- However, it <span class="hi-green">cannot detect colours</span>, they are responsible for <span class="hi-green">black-and-white vision</span>.
- They are <u>evenly distributed across the retina</u>, except for their absence from the yellow spot and the blind spot.

<span class="hi-blue">Cone cells</span> are <span class="hi-green">cone-shaped cells</span> that are stimulated by higher light intensities and are used mainly in bright light for [[colour vision]].
- They are <span class="hi-green">less numerous than rod cells</span> — most are concentrated at the <span class="hi-blue">yellow spot</span>, but few are found in the periphery of the retina. This is why objects appear most clearly when their image fall on the yellow spot.

The <span class="hi-blue">yellow spot</span> is located at the central region of the retina and <span class="hi-green">contains cone cells only</span>. Vision in the centre mainly relies on the detection of light falling on the yellow spot.

The <span class="hi-blue">blind spot</span> contains <span class="hi-green">no photoreceptors</span>. It is where the <u>optic nerve leaves the eye</u>.

The <span class="hi-blue">optic nerve</span> is a bundle of nerve fibres with neurones that are connected with photoreceptors on the retina.
- When the photoreceptos are stimulated by light, nerve impulses are generated to stimulate the <span class="hi-blue">visual centre</span> of the brain. They are transmitted via the optic nerve.
- The region where the optic nerve leave the brain is called the <u>blind spot</u>.

> [!note]
> Each type of cone cells (red, green and blue cone cells) have a dedicated neurone connected to it.

## Inside the eyeball
The eyeball is divided into two chambers by the lens internally.
- **Anterior chamber**
	- Space between the cornea and the lens, filled with <span class="hi-blue">aqueous humour</span>, a clear and watery solution secreted by the <span class="hi-blue">ciliary body</span>.
	- Supplies nutrients and oxygen to the cornea and the lens, which have no blood vessels.

- **Posterior chamber**
	- Space between the lens and the retina, filled with <span class="hi-blue">vitreous humour</span>, a clear and jelly-like fluid secreted by the <span class="hi-blue">ciliary body</span>.

↪ These chambers help <span class="hi-green">keep the shape of the eyeball</span> by maintaining the intraocular pressure and inflates the globe of the eye, and <span class="hi-green">refract and focus light</span> onto the retina.

# Optics of the eye
![[eye_optics.webp|450]]
Light rays from the object enter one's eyes through the cornea and are refracted by the <span class="hi-blue">cornea, aqueous humour, lens and vitreous humour</span> to be focused on the retina to form a real, vertically and <span class="hi-green">laterally inverted image</span> that is smaller than the object.

When <span class="hi-blue">photoreceptors</span> on the retina are stimulated by light falling on them, they generate and <span class="hi-green">send nerve impulses</span> along the optic nerve to the <span class="hi-blue">visual centre</span> of the brain, which interprets the nerve impulses to produce vision, allowing us to see an <u>upright image</u> of the object.

Image formed on the <span class="hi-blue">blind spot</span> is not visible because it has no photoreceptors to detect light, <span class="hi-green">no nerve impulses are generated</span> to send to the brain.

# Eye defects
## Short sight
![[short_sight.webp|150]]
**Short sight** is a defect that causes a person see near objects more clearly than distant objects. It occurs when either the <span class="hi-green">eyeball is too long</span> or that the <span class="hi-green">lens is too thick</span>, or a combination of both.

> [!info]
> People with severe short sight have a <span class="hi-green">higher risk for retinal detachment</span>. This happens as the eyeball continues to lengthen, pulling the retina away from the choroid.
> 
> Since retina contains light sensitive cells and obtains nutrients / oxygen from choroid, light sensitive cells will die and light falling on retina cannot be detected, no nerve impulse can be produced. Therefore, vision is impaired.

*Effects*:
- Light rays from nearby objects focus correctly.
  ![[short_sight_nearby.webp|300]]

- Light rays from <span class="hi-green">distant objects</span> are focused in front of the retina, resulting in a blurred image on the retina.
  ![[short_sight_distant.webp|340]]

*Correction method*:
- By wearing glasses containing <span class="hi-green">concave (diverging) lenses</span>.
- Light rays from distant objects are diverged before entering the eyes, allowing the image to be bright back into focus on the retina.
  ![[short_sight_corr.webp|340]]

## Long sight
![[long_sight.webp|150]]
**Long sight** is a defect that causes a person see distant objects more clearly than near objects. It occurs when either the <span class="hi-green">eyeball is too short</span> or that the <span class="hi-green">lens is too thin</span>, or a combination of both.

*Effects*:
- Light rays from <span class="hi-green">near objects</span> are focused behind the retina, resulting in a blurred image on the retina.
  ![[long_sight_near.webp|340]]

- Light rays from distant objects focus correctly.
  ![[long_sight_distant.webp|340]]

*Correction method*:
- By wearing glasses containing <span class="hi-green">convex (converging) lenses</span>.
- Light rays from near objects are converged before entering the eyes, a sharp image is formed on the retina.
  ![[long_sight_corr.webp|340]]

## Colour blindness
![[color_blindness.webp|400]]
**Colour blindness** is an inability to distinguish some or all colours. It is caused by the poor functioning or a deficiency of one or more types of cone cells. Colour blindness is an <span class="hi-blue">inherited</span> eye defect. In rare cases, it can be caused by damage to the retina or the brain.

<span class="hi-blue">Red-green colour blindness</span> is the most common type of colour blindness in humans, the person would not be able to distinguish red and green because of poor functioning or deficiency of red or green cone cells. <span class="hi-green">Total colour blindness is rare in humans.</span>

There is currently <span class="hi-green">no cure for colour blindness</span>, but colour-blind people generally live a normal life. Mild forms of colour blindness are often not recognized by the person concerned.

*Test cards for colour blindness*:
![[color_blind_test.webp]]

*Aids to improve vision*:
- Wear glasses with special <span class="hi-blue">filter lenses</span> to help one see more accurately.
- <span class="hi-blue">Mobile phone applications</span> that help colour-blind people see colours using the camera of their smartphones.
