The **human ear** is a mechanoreceptor for detecting sound (pressure waves). The brain receives the nerve impulses from the ears and interpret them to produce hearing.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">pinna</span> is a flap of elastic cartilage covered with skin, with a shape of a funnel to facilitate the collection of sound waves into the auditory canal.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">auditory canal</span> is a passageway for sound from the pinna to the eardrum.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">eardrum</span> is a thin and elastic membrane that vibrates when sound waves reach it and converts sound waves to mechanical vibrations.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">ear bones</span> amplify the vibrations from the eardrum and transmit them to the oval window.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">oval window</span> is a flexible membrane that transmits the vibrations to the cochlea in the inner ear.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">round window</span> is a flexible membrane that allows the pressure built up in the cochlea to be released into the middle ear.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">Eustachian tube</span> helps maintain equal pressure on either side of the eardrum by allowing air to enter or leave the middle ear.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">cochlea</span> is the lumen of the cochlea. It is divided lengthwise by membranes into three liquid filled canals.
- The <span style="color: violet">upper canal</span> is in contact with the oval window.
- The <span style="color: violet">lower canal</span> is in contact with the round window.
- The <span style="color: violet">central canal</span> contains sensory hair cells connected to the auditory nerve.
	- Movements of the endolymph cause hairs of the sensory hair cells to bend, stimulating the sensory hair cells to generate nerve impulses.
	- The nerve impulses are sent along the auditory nerve to the auditory centre of the brain for interpretation.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">semicircular canals</span> detect head movements and help us have a sense of balance.
