The **human ear** is a mechanoreceptor for detecting sound (pressure waves). The brain receives the nerve impulses from the ears and interpret them to produce hearing.

*Outer ear*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Pinna</span>: Flap of funnel shaped <span class="hi-green">elastic</span> cartilage covered with skin to <span class="hi-green">facilitate the collection of sound waves</span> into the auditory canal.
- <span class="hi-blue">Auditory canal</span>: Passageway for sound from the pinna to the eardrum.

*Middle ear*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Eardrum</span>: <span class="hi-green">Thin and elastic</span> membrane that vibrates when sound waves reach it and converts sound waves to mechanical vibrations.
- <span class="hi-blue">Ear bones</span>: <span class="hi-green">Amplifies the vibrations</span> from the eardrum and transmits them to the oval window.
- <span class="hi-blue">Eustachian tube</span>: Helps <span class="hi-green">maintain equal pressure</span> on either side of the <span class="hi-blue"><u>eardrum</u></span> by allowing air to enter or leave the middle ear.

*Inner ear*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Oval window</span>: Flexible membrane that <span class="hi-green">transmits</span> the vibrations to the cochlea in the inner ear.
- <span class="hi-blue">Round window</span>: Flexible membrane that allows the pressure built up in the cochlea to be released into the middle ear.
- <span class="hi-blue">Cochlea</span>: Divided lengthwise by membranes into three liquid filled canals.
	- <span class="hi-blue">Upper canal</span>: In contact with the <span class="hi-blue">oval window</span>.
	- <span class="hi-blue">Lower canal</span>: In contact with the <span class="hi-blue">round window</span>.
	- <span class="hi-blue">Central canal</span>: Contains sensory hair cells connected to the auditory nerve.
		- Movements of the endolymph cause hairs of the sensory hair cells to bend, stimulating the sensory hair cells to generate nerve impulses.
		- The nerve impulses are sent along the auditory nerve to the auditory centre of the brain for interpretation.
- <span class="hi-blue">Semicircular canals</span>: Detect <span class="hi-green">head movements</span> and help us have a <span class="hi-green">sense of balance</span>.
