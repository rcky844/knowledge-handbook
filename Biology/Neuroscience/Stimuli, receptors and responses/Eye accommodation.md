*Main article: [[Human eye]]*

**Eye accommodation** refers to the changing of the curvature (shape) of the lens in order to allow light rays from objects at different distances to be focused on the retina. This works because of the elastic nature of the lens of the eye.

> [!note]
> - Light rays from nearby objects are more divergent (spread out) and require more refraction.
> - Light rays from distant objects are nearly parallel and require less refraction.

#### Focusing on near object

| :---------------------------: | :---------------------------: |

1. **Circular ciliary muscles around the lens**
   Contract

2. **Suspensory ligaments**
   Become slack (tension reduced)

3. **Lens**
   Becomes thicker (more convex) due to its elasticity and refracts light more

#### Focusing on a distant object

| :------------------------------: | :------------------------------: |

1. **Circular ciliary muscles around the lens**
   Relax

2. **Suspensory ligaments**
   Becomes tighter (tension increased)

3. **Lens**
   Becomes thinner (less convex) due to its elasticity and refracts light less
