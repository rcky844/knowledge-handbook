**Phototropism** is the directional growth movement of a plant part in response to unilateral light. It is controlled by auxins.

# Growth responses
*Shoots*: positive phototropism (towards light)
- Leaves are brought to face the light source.
- Maximum amount of light can be absorbed for [[photosynthesis]].

*Roots*: negative phototropism (away from light)
- Roots can grow downward into the soil for <span class="hi-green">anchorage</span>.

# Control by auxins
**Auxins** are a group of plant hormones produced in the <span class="hi-blue">apical meristem</span> at the tip of shoots and roots. They are transported to the <span class="hi-blue">regions of elongation</span>, stimulating the cells to elongate and hence promote growth.

*Illumination from all directions*:
- Auxins distribute evenly from all directions in the regions of elongation of the shoot and the root.
- The shoot and the root shows <span class="hi-green">growth without bending</span>.

*Illumination with unilateral light*:
- Auxins <span class="hi-blue">migrate</span> from the illuminated side to the shaded side of the shoot and root.
- High concentration of auxins stimulates shoot growth on the illuminated side, the <u>shoot</u> shows <span class="hi-green">bending growth towards the light</span>.
- High concentration of auxins inhibits root growth on the shaded side, the <u>root</u> shows <span class="hi-green">bending growth away from the light</span>.

> [!warning]
> Light does not destroy auxins in the illuminated side of the plant.

## Effects of different concentrations of auxins
![[auxins_graph.webp|550]]
- Auxin concentrations from 10<sup>-6</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> ppm promote root growth, but are insufficient to promote shoot growth.
- Auxin concentrations from 10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> ppm promote both shoot and root growth.
- Auxin concentrations from 10<sup>-2</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> ppm promote shoot growth, but inhibit root growth.
- Auxin concentrations above 10<sup>2</sup> ppm inhibit both shoot and root growth.

# Discovery of auxins
![[auxins_coleoptile.webp|500]]
**Coleoptiles** are <u>protective sheaths</u> that cover the first leaf of a <span class="hi-blue">monocotyledonous seedling</span> as the young shoot emerges from the soil. It was used to investigate phototropism.

*Suitability for experiments*:
- They are fast-growing.
- They are easy to handle.
- They have a simple structure for easy observation.

## Experiments on discovering auxins
### Charles Darwin’s experiment on phototropism (1880)
![[auxins_exp1.webp|560]]

*Observations*:
- If the tip is <u>removed / blocked</u> from light, no bending growth movement occurs.
- Bending growth occurs even if the lower part of the coleoptile is covered.

*Conclusions*:
- The tip is responsible for detecting the <span class="hi-blue">unilateral light</span>.
- Bending growth (response) did not occur in the tip itself but in the <span class="hi-green">region below the tip</span>.

*Hypothesis*:
A signal is transmitted from the tip to a lower part of the coleoptile to exert the effects of growth.

### Boysen-Jensen’s experiments on nature of signal transmission (1913)
![[auxins_exp2.webp|500]]

*Observations*:
- Bending growth occurred even when an agar block is inserted.
- Growth does not occur when a mica plate is inserted.

*Conclusions*:
- A signal is transmitted from the tip by [[Diffusion|diffusing]] through the <span class="hi-blue">agar block</span> to reach the lower part of the coleoptile and exert the effects of growth.
- The signal transmitted from the tip to the lower part of the coleoptile is chemical in nature, as the <span class="hi-blue">mica plate</span> is <span class="hi-green">impermeable to chemicals</span> and blocked the transmission of signal.

*Conclusions*:
The chemical produced by the tip passes down the shaded side of the coleoptile.

### Frits Went’s experiments (1926)
![[auxins_exp4.webp|550]]

*Conclusions*:
- The agar block contained the chemical produced by the tip of the coleoptile.
- This chemical stimulated growth as it passed down the decapitated coleoptile.
- The decapitated coleoptile bent to one side because of a higher concentration of the growth-promoting chemical on the other side.

*Conclusions*:
Unilateral light had caused an uneven distribution of the chemical and the shaded side had a higher concentration of the chemical.
