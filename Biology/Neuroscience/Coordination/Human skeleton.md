#### Structure
##### Axial skeleton
The **axial skeleton** forms the central axis of the body.

###### Skull
![[skull.webp|450]]

The **skull** consists of the <span style="color: lightgreen">cranium</span> and <span style="color: lightgreen">facial bones</span> (e.g. cheekbones and jaws). The cranium is formed by eight flattened bones fused together at [[Joints and ligaments|immovable joints]] called sutures, enclosing and protecting the brain, the eyeballs and the middle and inner ears.

 **Joints and sockets in the skull**:
 - The upper jaw is fused to the cranium and is immovable.
 - The lower jaw forms a [[Joints and ligaments|movable joint]] with the cranium.
 - Upper and lower jaws contain sockets that hold the teeth in place.

###### Vertebral column
![[vertebral_column.webp|500]]

The **vertebral column** consists of 33 vertebrae. It has the following functions:
- Supports the weight of the upper part of the body.
- Provides surfaces for muscle attachment to maintain posture and allow movement.
- Encloses and protects the spinal cord.

There are pieces of cartilage called intervertebral discs between the vertebrae. They can be compressed and allows the vertebral column to bend. This helps absorb shock and prevent wearing of the vertebrae during movement.

###### Rib cage
![[rib_cage.webp]]

The **rib cage** is formed by ribs, the sternum and part of the vertebral column. It protects the heart and the lungs, and is involved in [[Lungs and associated structures|breathing]].

There are twelve pairs of ribs in a rib cage, all of which are connected to the vertebrae.
- The first ten pairs are connected to the sternum by cartilage.
- The other two pairs are not connected to the sternum. They are referred to as the floating ribs.

###### Appendicular skeleton
![[appendicular_skeleton.webp]]

The **appendicular skeleton** is the skeleton lying on either side of the body.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Limb bones</span>: Bones of the two arms and the two legs.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Limb girdles</span>: Provide a connection between the limbs and the axial skeleton.

 **Limb girdles in the human body**:
 - <span style="color: lightgreen">Pectoral girdle</span>: Forms the shoulders and attaches the arms to the axial skeleton.
 - <span style="color: lightgreen">Pelvic girdle</span>: Forms the hips and attaches the legs to the axial skeleton.
	 - It is usually wider in female than that of a male to allow the fetus to pass out more easily during birth.
	 - It protects the urinary bladder and part of the reproductive system.

#### Components
##### Bones
![[bones.webp|600]]

**Composition**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Organic materials</span>: Living cells and proteins (e.g. collagen)
	- They provide flexible and a certain degree of elasticity to the bones.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Inorganic materials</span>: Minerals, mainly calcium phosphate and some calcium carbonate
	- They make the bones hard.

**Types of bone tissues**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Compact bone</span>: Dense bone that makes up the outer part of all bones and most of the shaft of long bones.
	- It provides strength for weight bearing
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Spongy bone</span>: Found at the ends of long bones and contains many small cavities (porous).
	- It adds strength to the bone with the minimum of weight.

**Kinds of bone marrow**:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Red bone marrow</span>: Fills the cavities of spongy bones.
	- It is the site of formation of blood cells.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Yellow bone marrow</span>: Fills the central cavity in the shaft of long bones.
	- It contains stored fat.

**Functions of blood vessels and nerves**:
- Blood vessels run through the bone tissue to supply nutrients and oxygen to the bone cells and remove waste from them.
- Nerves allow for the detection of pain (for protection).

##### Cartilage
![[cartilage.webp|600]]

**Cartilage** is made up of <u>living cells</u>.
- <u>Softer</u> and <u>less rigid</u> than bones because it contains fewer minerals.
- <u>More elastic</u> than bones due to higher content of collagen.

**Functions**:
Some cartilage cover the end surfaces of bones. They act as shock absorber, reduces friction between the bones during movement and prevents wearing of bones at the joints.

Some are found in various structures (e.g. pinna, trachea, epiglottis). This helps it maintain shape and provides support.

**Growth and repair**:
Cartilage can grow and repair themselves because they are living tissues. However, it repairs more slowly than other tissues since cartilage does not have any blood vessels and nerves.

#### Functions of the skeleton
##### Support
- It provides a rigid framework to support the body weight and hold the body upright.
- It gives definite shapes to different parts of the body.

##### Movement
- It provides surfaces for attachment of skeletal muscles, and works with skeletal muscles to allow movement of the body.

##### Protection of internal organs
- The skull protects the brain, the eyeballs and the ears.
- The vertebral column protects the spinal cord.
- The rib cage protects the heart and the lungs.
- The pelvic girdle protects the urinary bladder and parts of the reproductive system.

##### Storage
- Bones store minerals (e.g. calcium and phosphate).
- Yellow bone marrow stores fat.

##### Blood cell formation
- Many bones contain red bone marrow that produces red blood cells, white blood cells and blood platelets.
