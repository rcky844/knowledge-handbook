**Skeletal muscles**, also **striated muscles**, are made up of bundles of muscle fibres surrounded by connective tissues. Each muscle fibre is a singe, elongated muscle cell that contains a number of nuclei. They are attached to bones by <u>tough and inelastic</u> tendons made up of collagen fibres.

Skeletal muscles appear to have striations of light bands and dark bands when viewed with a microscope. This is why they are also called striated muscles.

#### Mechanism
- Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles because their contractions can be consciously controlled by the cerebrum.
- Skeletal muscles contract quickly but also fatigue quickly.
- Contractions of skeletal muscles produce heat, helping to maintain a stable body temperature.

> [!note]
> Skeletal muscles can also contract involuntarily through reflex actions.

#### Transmission of pulling force
![[transmission_pulling_force.webp|450]]

Skeletal muscles are attached to bones by tendons, with one end that does not move, and another end that moves when the muscles contract.

Tendons are tough and inelastic. They can effectively transmit the pulling force from muscles to bones.

##### Actions of opposing muscles
Skeletal muscles usually work in pairs as opposing muscles to move bones in opposite directions.

One muscle contracts to pull a bone into one position, while another muscle contracts to return the bone to its original position. Pairs of muscles working in this manner are called <span style="color: lightgreen">opposing muscles</span> or <span style="color: lightgreen">antagonistic muscles</span>.
- A <span style="color: lightgreen">flexor</span> <u>bends a limb</u> when it contracts.
- An <span style="color: lightgreen">extensor</span> <u>straightens the same limb</u> when it contracts.

##### Opposing muscles in the arm

When a flexor contracts, the opposing extensor is relaxed to allow the limb to bend. When a extensor contracts, the opposing flexor is relaxed to allow the limb to straighten.

Note that in the above example, the biceps is a flexor, while the triceps is an extensions.

#### Neuromuscular junctions

**Neuromuscular junctions** are special [[Neurones#Transmission of nerve impulses|synapses]] formed between the branches of axon of a motor neurone and muscule fibres of a skeletal muscle. They are responsible for carrying nerve impulses to initiate muscle contractions.

![[neuromuscular_junction.webp|500]]
- At a neuromuscular junction, the membrane of the muscle fibre becomes highly folded to form a motor end plate. This provides a large surface area for the neurotransmitters to bind to its receptor sites.
- Since motor neurones form neuromuscular junctions with a number of muscle fibres, many muscle fibres can contract at the same time, generating a great pulling force.
