# Nervous system
**Nervous system** is responsible for <u>nervous coordination</u>.

*Parts of the nervous system*:
- **Central nervous system (CNS)**
  Consists of the <span class="hi-blue">brain and spinal cord</span>, and receives sensory signals in the form of nerve impulses from receptors in different parts of the body, then interprets the nerve impulses and initiating responses.

- **Peripheral nervous system (PNS)**
  Consists of nerves outside the CNS, and named from where they arise:
	- *Cranial nerves*: (e.g. optic nerves and auditory nerves)
	  Arise from the brain, linking the brain with receptors and effectors in the head and the neck.
	- *Spinal nerves*:
	  Arise from the spinal cord, linking the spinal cord with receptors and effectors in the rest of the body.

# Endocrine system
**Endocrine system** is responsible for <u>hormonal coordination</u>, consisting of a number of <span class="hi-blue">endocrine glands</span> secreting hormones to coordinate many physiological processes in the body.

## Endocrine glands

## Nature of coordination
**Hormones** are chemical messengers that travel throughout the body in the bloodstream. They have the following properties:
- They are <span class="hi-green">very specific</span> and will <u>only act on target organs</u> with cells that have specific <span class="hi-blue">receptor sites</span>.
	- The hormone binds to the receptor sites of the target cells to produce specific responses.
	- Cells that lack receptor sites do not respond to the hormone.
- They are <span class="hi-green">effective in very low concentrations</span>, but can have <u>widespread and long-lasting effects</u>.
	- The hormone may affect multiple organs situated far away from the gland that produce it.
