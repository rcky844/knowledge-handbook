# Structure
## Axial skeleton
The **axial skeleton** forms the central axis of the body.

### Skull
The **skull** consists of the <span class="hi-blue">cranium</span> and <span class="hi-blue">facial bones</span> (e.g. cheekbones and jaws).

![[skull.webp|450]]

 The cranium is formed by eight flattened bones fused together at [[Joints and ligaments|immovable joints]] called <span class="hi-blue">sutures</span>, <span class="hi-green">enclosing and protecting the brain</span>, the eyeballs and the middle and inner ears.

 *Joints and sockets in the skull*:
 - The <span class="hi-blue">upper jaw</span> is fused to the cranium and is immovable.
 - The <span class="hi-blue">lower jaw</span> forms a [[Joints and ligaments|movable joint]] with the cranium.
 - Upper and lower jaws contain <span class="hi-blue">sockets</span> that hold the teeth in place.

### Vertebral column
The **vertebral column** consists of 33 vertebrae.

![[vertebral_column.webp|500]]

*Functions of the vertebral column*:
- Supports the weight of the upper part of the body.
- Provides surfaces for muscle attachment to maintain posture and allow movement.
- Encloses and protects the spinal cord.

There are pieces of cartilage called <span class="hi-blue">intervertebral discs</span> between the vertebrae. They can be compressed and allows the vertebral column to bend. This helps <span class="hi-green">absorb shock and prevent wearing of the vertebrae</span> during movement.

### Rib cage
The **rib cage** is formed by <span class="hi-blue">ribs</span>, the <span class="hi-blue">sternum</span> and part of the <span class="hi-blue">vertebral column</span>. It protects the heart and the lungs, and is involved in [[Lungs and associated structures|breathing]].

![[rib_cage.webp]]

There are twelve pairs of ribs in a rib cage, all of which are connected to the vertebrae.
- The <u>first ten pairs</u> are connected to the <span class="hi-blue">sternum</span> by a cartilage.
- The <u>other two pairs</u> are <span class="hi-green">not connected</span> to the sternum. They are referred to as the floating ribs.

### Appendicular skeleton
The **appendicular skeleton** is the skeleton lying on either side of the body.

![[appendicular_skeleton.webp|600]]

*Components*:
- **Limb bones**: Bones of the two arms and the two legs.
- **Limb girdles**: Provide a <u>connection</u> between the limbs and the axial skeleton.

 *Limb girdles in the human body*:
 - **Pectoral girdle**: Forms the <span class="hi-blue">shoulders</span> and attaches the arms to the axial skeleton.
 - **Pelvic girdle**: Forms the <span class="hi-blue">hips</span> and attaches the legs to the axial skeleton.
	 - It is usually wider in female than that of a male to allow the fetus to pass out more easily during birth.
	 - It protects the urinary bladder and part of the reproductive system.

# Components
## Bones
![[bones.webp|650]]

*Composition*:
- **Organic materials**: <span class="hi-blue">Living cells and proteins</span> (e.g. collagen)
	- They provide <span class="hi-green">flexibility</span> and a certain degree of <span class="hi-green">elasticity</span> to the bones.
- **Inorganic materials**: <span class="hi-blue">Minerals</span>, mainly calcium phosphate and some calcium carbonate
	- They make the bones <span class="hi-green">hard</span>.

*Types of bone tissues*:
- **Compact bone**: <span class="hi-blue">Dense bone</span> that makes up the outer part of all bones and most of the shaft of long bones.
	- It provides <span class="hi-green">strength</span> for weight bearing.
- **Spongy bone**: Found at the ends of long bones and <span class="hi-blue">contains many small cavities</span> (porous).
	- It <span class="hi-green">adds strength</span> to the bone with the minimum of weight.

*Kinds of bone marrow*:
- **Red bone marrow**: Fills the cavities of spongy bones.
	- It is the site of <span class="hi-blue">formation of blood cells</span>.
- **Yellow bone marrow**: Fills the central cavity in the shaft of long bones.
	- It contains <span class="hi-blue">stored fat</span>.

*Functions of blood vessels and nerves*:
- Blood vessels run through the bone tissue to <span class="hi-green">supply nutrients and oxygen</span> to the bone cells and remove waste from them.
- Nerves allow for the <span class="hi-green">detection of pain</span> (for protection).

## Cartilage
![[cartilage.webp|600]]

**Cartilage** is made up of <span class="hi-blue">living cells</span>.
- <span class="hi-green">Softer and less rigid</span> than bones because it contains fewer minerals.
- <span class="hi-green">More elastic</span> than bones due to higher content of collagen.

*Functions*:
- Some cartilage cover the end surfaces of bones. They act as <span class="hi-green">shock absorber</span>, <span class="hi-green">reduces friction</span> between the bones during movement and <span class="hi-green">prevents wearing</span> of bones at the joints.
- Some are found in various structures (e.g. pinna, trachea, epiglottis). This helps it <span class="hi-green">maintain shape</span> and <span class="hi-green">provides support</span>.

*Growth and repair*:
Cartilage can grow and repair themselves because they are living tissues. However, it <span class="hi-green">repairs more slowly</span> than other tissues since <u>cartilage does not have any blood vessels and nerves</u>.

# Functions of the skeleton
## Support
- It provides a rigid framework to support the body weight and hold the body upright.
- It gives definite shapes to different parts of the body.

## Movement
- It provides surfaces for attachment of skeletal muscles, and works with skeletal muscles to allow movement of the body.

## Protection of internal organs
- The skull protects the brain, the eyeballs and the ears.
- The vertebral column protects the spinal cord.
- The rib cage protects the heart and the lungs.
- The pelvic girdle protects the urinary bladder and parts of the reproductive system.

## Storage
- Bones store minerals (e.g. calcium and phosphate).
- Yellow bone marrow stores fat.

## Blood cell formation
- Many bones contain red bone marrow that produces red blood cells, white blood cells and blood platelets.
