**Skeletal muscles**, also **striated muscles**, are made up of bundles of muscle fibres surrounded by <span class="hi-green">connective tissues</span>. Each muscle fibre is a singe, elongated muscle cell that contains a number of nuclei. They are attached to bones by <span class="hi-green">tough and inelastic</span> tendons made up of collagen fibres.

Skeletal muscles appear to have <span class="hi-green">striations of light bands and dark bands</span> when viewed with a microscope. This is why they are also called <span class="hi-blue">striated muscles</span>.

# Mechanism
- Skeletal muscles are <span class="hi-blue">voluntary muscles</span> because their contractions can be <span class="hi-green">consciously controlled</span> by the cerebrum.
- Skeletal muscles contract quickly but also <span class="hi-green">fatigue quickly</span>.
- Contractions of skeletal muscles <span class="hi-green">produce heat</span>, helping to maintain a stable body temperature.

> [!tip]
> Skeletal muscles can also contract involuntarily through [[reflex actions]].

# Transmission of pulling force
Skeletal muscles are attached to bones by <span class="hi-blue">tendons</span>, with one end that does not move, and another end that moves when the muscles contract.

![[transmission_pulling_force.webp|450]]

Tendons are <span class="hi-green">tough and inelastic</span>. They can effectively transmit the pulling force from muscles to bones.

## Actions of opposing muscles
Skeletal muscles usually work in pairs as opposing muscles to move bones in opposite directions.

One muscle contracts to pull a bone into one position, while another muscle contracts to return the bone to its original position. Pairs of muscles working in this manner are called <span class="hi-blue">opposing muscles</span> or <span class="hi-blue">antagonistic muscles</span>.
- A <span class="hi-blue">flexor</span> <span class="hi-green">bends a limb at a joint</span> when it contracts.
- An <span class="hi-blue">extensor</span> <span class="hi-green">straightens the same limb at a joint</span> when it contracts.

## Opposing muscles in the arm
![[opposing_muscles_arm.webp|450]]
In the above example, the biceps is a flexor, while the triceps is an extensor.

*Naming of muscles*:
- When a <span class="hi-blue">flexor</span> contracts, the opposing extensor is relaxed to allow the limb to <span class="hi-green">bend</span>.
- When a <span class="hi-blue">extensor</span> contracts, the opposing flexor is relaxed to allow the limb to <span class="hi-green">straighten</span>.

# Neuromuscular junctions
![[muscle_contract.webp]]

**Neuromuscular junctions** are special [[Neurones#Transmission of nerve impulses|synapses]] formed between the <u>branches of axon of a motor neurone and muscle fibres of a skeletal muscle</u>. They are responsible for carrying nerve impulses to initiate muscle contractions.

![[neuromuscular_junction.webp|520]]
- At a neuromuscular junction, the membrane of the muscle fibre becomes <span class="hi-green">highly folded</span> to form a motor end plate. This provides a <span class="hi-green">large surface area</span> for the neurotransmitters to bind to its receptor sites.
- Since motor neurones form neuromuscular junctions with a <u>number of muscle fibres</u>, many muscle fibres can contract at the same time, generating a <span class="hi-green">great pulling force</span>.
