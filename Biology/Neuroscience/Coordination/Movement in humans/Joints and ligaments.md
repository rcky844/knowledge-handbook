A **joint** is the junction where two or more bones meet.

*Types of joints*:
- <span class="hi-blue">Movable joints (synovial joints)</span> allows movement.
  (e.g. joints of shoulder, hips, knees, elbows, fingers and toes)
- <span class="hi-blue">Immovable joints</span> (e.g. joints between the bones of the cranium)

# Structure of a movable joint
![[movable_joint.webp|450]]

A **movable joint** is held together by <span class="hi-green">tough and elastic</span> ligaments that forms the fibrous capsule enclosing the joint.
- The end surfaces of the bone are covered with <span class="hi-blue">cartilage</span>.
- The inner surface of the <span class="hi-blue">fibrous capsule</span> is lined by a <span class="hi-blue">synovial membrane</span> that secretes <span class="hi-blue">synovial fluid</span> into the <span class="hi-blue">synovial cavity</span>.

*Functions of ligaments*:
- Allow the bones to move (→ Elastic)
- Hold the bones in position (→ Tough)
- Prevent dislocation of the joint during movement (→ Tough)

*Functions of cartilage*:
- Acts as a shock absorber.
- Reduces friction between the bones during movement.
- Prevents wearing of bones at the joints during movement.

*Functions of synovial fluid*:
- Serves as a lubricant to reduce friction between the bones during movement.
- Supplies oxygen and nutrients to the cartilage.

## Types of movable joints
### Hinge joint
| ![[hinge_joint.webp\|200]] | ![[hinge_joint_egs.webp\|400]] |
| :--: | :--: |
The convex surfaces of one bone fits into the concave surface of another bone. This allows movement in <span class="hi-green">one plane only</span>.

### Ball-and-socket joint
| ![[ball_and_socket_joint.webp\|180]] | ![[ball_and_socket_joint_egs.webp\|300]] |
| :--: | :--: |
One of the bones has a rounded head (ball) and the other bone has a cup-like depression (socket). This allows movement in <span class="hi-green">many planes</span> (almost all directions).
