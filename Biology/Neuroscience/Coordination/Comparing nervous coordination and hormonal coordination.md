|     **System involved**      |                             Nervous system                              |                                     Endocrine system, circulatory system                                     |
| **Components of the system** |                  Brain, spinal cord, nerves, neurones                   |                                           Endocrine glands, blood                                            |
|    **Nature of message**     |    Electrical (nerve impulses); and<br>Chemical (neurotransmitters)     |                                             Chemical (hormones)                                              |
|  **Route of transmission**   |                 Along nerve fibres and across synapses                  |                                                 Bloodstream                                                  |
|  **Speed of transmission**   |                                 Faster                                  |                                                    Slower                                                    |
|  **Responses coordinated**   | [[Voluntary actions]], [[Reflex actions]] and other involuntary actions |                 Growth and development, reproduction, regulation of the internal environment                 |
|    **Speed of response**     |                             Usually faster                              |                                                Usually slower                                                |
|   **Duration of response**   |                               Short-term                                |                                             Usually long-lasting                                             |
|      **Area affected**       |        Localised (restricted to the effectors with nerve supply)        |         Widespread (one hormone may affect several widely separated target organs at the same time)          |
|       **Significance**       |                Coping with sudden stimuli or emergencies                | Synchronizing different parts of the body to bring about overall responses for sustaining long-term survival |
