**Reflex actions** are rapid automatic responses to a stimulus, allowing the body to respond quickly and protect us from danger. It has the characteristics below:
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Stereotyped</span>: Same stimulus always lead to the same response.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Involuntary</span>: They are not under the control of the cerebrum.
- <span style="color: lightgreen">Inborn and no prior learning</span> is required.

#### Functioning
In humans, both the medulla oblongata and the spinal cord serve as <span style="color: violet">reflex centres</span>. They are responsible for these reflex actions:
- **Medulla**: Sneezing, coughing, saliva secretion, swallowing, etc.
- **Spinal cord**: Spinal reflexes, withdrawal reflex, knee jerk reflex

A reflex action involves a <span style="color: violet">reflex arc</span>, the nervous pathway along which nerve impulses travel for the reflex action to take place. It consists of five components:
- A receptor
- A sensory neurone
- An interneurone (may be absent)
- A motor neurone
- An effector

#### Examples
##### Withdrawal reflex
The **withdrawal reflex** is an automatic response to withdraw a limb from a painful stimulus. This protects us from being injured (when touching a hot or sharp object accidentally with a hand).

> [!note]
> The receptor is linked to the effector by only three neurones: sensory neurone, interneurone and motor neurone. Nerve impulses can travel through the reflex arc very quickly (in < 0.1 s).

Even though the cerebrum does not control the reflex, it will receive information from the sensory neurone through another interneurone not part of the reflex arc. The sensation of pain is felt after the hand has been withdrawn as it takes longer to travel to the cerebrum.

The reflex action can be overcome voluntarily via another interneurone of another nervous pathway that forms a synapse with the motor neurone. This allows the cerebrum to transmit nerve impulses from the cerebrum to initiate voluntary movement of the arm.

##### Knee-jerk reflex
When the tendon just below the knee cap is tapped, a hanging leg will give a little kick automatically. This helps <u>maintain body posture and balance</u> during walking.

> [!note]
> The receptor is linked to the effector by only two neurones: a sensory neurone and a motor neurone.

Sensation of the tapping below the knee cap can be felt, as an interneurone of another nervous pathway forms a synapse with the sensory neurone in the reflex arc, nerve impulses are transmitted to the cerebrum.
