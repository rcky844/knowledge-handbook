![[neurone.webp|600]]

*Components*:
- **Cell body**: Contains the nucleus and a variety of [[Sub-cellular structures in cells|organelles]].
- **Nerve fibres**: Cytoplasmic processes (extensions) extending from the cell body.
	- <span class="hi-blue">Dendons</span> transmit nerve impulses <span class="hi-green">towards the cell body</span>.
	  They can form <span class="hi-green">branches</span> called <span class="hi-blue">dendrites</span> to receive information from a number of neurones.
	- <span class="hi-blue">Axons</span> transmit nerve impulses <span class="hi-green">away from the cell body</span>.

# Adaptations for transmitting nerve impulses
- **A neurone has long nerve fibres.**
  This is to transmit nerve impulses <span class="hi-green">over a long distance</span>.

- **A dendron has many branches (dendrites).**
  This is to receive information from other neurones so that each neurone can <span class="hi-green">communicate with many others</span>.

- **Most nerve fibres are surrounded by a lipid covering called the myelin sheath.**
  This is to <span class="hi-green">protect and insulate</span> the nerve fibres, so that the loss of nerve impulses to the surroundings can be prevented. It can also <span class="hi-green">speed up the transmission of nerve impulses</span>.

> [!tip]
> Nerve fibres surrounded by the myelin sheath is referred to as <span class="hi-blue">myelinated</span>.

# Types of neurones
![[neurones_type.webp]]

- **Sensory neurones**
  They transmit nerve impulses <span class="hi-green">from receptors to the CNS</span>.
  They have an <span class="hi-green">oval-shaped cell body</span> lying <u>outside</u> the CNS, with a <span class="hi-green">long dendron</span> and a <span class="hi-green">short axon</span>.

- **Motor neurones**
  They transmit nerve impulses <span class="hi-green">from the CNS to effectors</span> (e.g. muscles and glands).
  They have an <span class="hi-green">irregularly shaped cell body</span> lying <u>outside</u> the CNS, with a number of <span class="hi-green">very short dendrons</span> and <span class="hi-green">long axons</span>.

- **Interneurones**
  They transmit nerve impulses <span class="hi-green">within the CNS</span>.
  They have an <span class="hi-green">irregularly shaped cell body</span> lying <u>inside</u> the CNS, with <span class="hi-green">short dendrons</span> and <span class="hi-green">short axons</span>.

# Structure of a nerve
![[nerve.webp|500]]
![[nerve_photomicrograph.webp|200]]

- A nerve is made up of <span class="hi-green">bundles of nerve fibres</span> wrapped in tough connective tissue.
- Some nerves consists of nerve fibres of either sensory or motor neurones only.
  (e.g. <span class="hi-blue">optic nerve</span> is a cranial nerve consisting of nerve fibres of sensory neurones only)
- However, spinal nerves consist of nerve fibres of both sensory and motor neurones.

# Transmission of nerve impulses
A **synapse** is the junction between two neurones. Transmission of nerve impulses from one neurone to another is done by means of <span class="hi-blue">neurotransmitters</span>.

![[synapse_transmission.webp]]

- <span class="hi-blue">Synaptic knob</span>: Swollen structure located at the <u>end of an axon</u>, with numerous [[mitochondria]] for energy production and contains <span class="hi-blue">synaptic vesicles</span> to store neurotransmitters.
- <span class="hi-blue">Synaptic cleft</span>: <span class="hi-green">Tiny gap that separates the neurones.</span> There are also [[enzymes]] present in the synaptic cleft to break down neurotransmitters.

> [!note]
> - There is <span class="hi-green">no physical contact between neurones</span>, nerve impulses cannot travel directly to the next neurone.
> - The enzymes in the synaptic cleft is specific in action to prevent <span class="hi-green">repeated nerve impulses</span> from being generated when the dendron is continuously stimulated.

## Importance of synapses
- **Unidirectional transmission of nerve impulses**
	- *Description*: Synapses ensure that nerve impulses are <span class="hi-green">transmitted in one direction only</span> (from axon of one neurone to dendron of the next neurone).
	- *Explanation*: Only <span class="hi-blue">synaptic knobs</span> can <u>secrete neurotransmitters</u> and only <span class="hi-blue">dendrons</span> have <u>receptor sites for binding</u> with neurotransmitters.

- **Formation of neural networks**
  Synapses allow one neurone to communicate with many other neurones to form neural networks. This allows <span class="hi-green">complex coordination</span> between receptors and effectors.
