# Protective structures
![[cns.webp]]

*Bones*: Bony structures provides <span class="hi-blue">mechanical protection</span> to the CNS.
- <span class="hi-blue">Cranium</span>: The brain is enclosed in the cranium of the skull.
- <span class="hi-blue">Vertebral column</span>: The spinal cord is enclosed in the vertebral column.

*Membranes*:
The <span class="hi-blue">meninges</span> are protective membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord.

*Cerebrospinal fluid*:
- It is formed in cavities in the brain and fills the space between the inner and middle meninges, as well as the internal cavities of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord.
- It acts as a <span class="hi-green">shock absorber</span> and offers <span class="hi-green">mechanical support</span> to the brain and the spinal cord, and <span class="hi-green">supplies oxygen and nutrients</span> to the neurones and removes wastes from them.

# Brain
![[brain.webp|400]]

## Cerebrum
The **cerebrum** is the site of <span class="hi-green">consciousness</span>, controlling [[voluntary actions]] (e.g. speaking and walking) and associated with intelligence, reasoning, memory, emotions and personality.

![[cerebrum.webp]]

*Cerebral hemispheres*:
- Each hemisphere is responsible for the <span class="hi-green">opposite side of the body</span>.
- The two hemispheres are connected by nerve fibres for communication.

*Distribution of grey matter and white matter*:
- **Grey matter**: Thin (< 5 mm) <span class="hi-green">outer layer</span> of each hemisphere. <span class="hi-blue">(cerebral cortex)</span>
	- It contains mainly <span class="hi-blue">cell bodies</span> of neurones which <u>appear grey</u>.
	- It is also <span class="hi-green">highly folded</span> to <u>increase surface area</u> so that more neurones can be packed into it.
- **White matter**: <span class="hi-green">Inner layer</span> beneath the cerebral cortex.
  It appears white due to the <span class="hi-blue">myelin sheaths</span> on the myelinated nerve fibres.

*Functional areas*:
![[cerebrum_funarea.webp|500]]
- **Sensory areas**
	- <u>Receive and interpret</u> nerve impulses from sensory receptors to produce sensations. (e.g. vision, hearing, taste, smell, touch, pain)

- **Association areas**
	- <u>Integrate</u> information from different sensory areas and <u>make decisions</u> in relation to the stored information (i.e. memory) from the past.
	- Nerve impulses are generated there and sent to different motor areas to <u>initiate responses</u>.

- **Motor areas**
	- <u>Generate and send</u> nerve impulses to effectors (e.g. skeletal muscles) to produce voluntary responses.

## Cerebellum
The **cerebellum** coordinates <span class="hi-green">contractions of skeletal muscles</span> for <u>smooth movements</u> and <u>maintains body posture and balance</u>.

![[cerebellum.webp|450]]

As the cerebellum is responsible for <span class="hi-green">precision and fine control</span> of [[Voluntary actions|voluntary movements]], damaging this region of the brain may result in jerky and uncoordinated movements.

*Distribution of grey matter and white matter*:
- **Grey matter**: <u>Highly folded</u> and makes up the <span class="hi-green">outer layer</span>.
- **White matter**: Makes up the <span class="hi-green">inner layer</span>.

## Medulla oblongata (Medulla)
The **medulla oblongata** controls <span class="hi-blue">involuntary actions</span> not under conscious control (e.g. vital processes â€” heart rate, breathing), and also serves as the reflex centre coordinating many reflex actions in the head (e.g. sneezing, coughing, saliva secretion, swallowing)

*Distribution of grey matter and white matter*:
- **Grey matter**: Makes up the <span class="hi-green">inner layer</span>.
- **White matter**: Makes up the relatively smooth <span class="hi-green">outer layer</span>.

# Spinal cord
![[spinal_cord.webp|600]]

The **spinal cord** is a long cylindrical structure running from <span class="hi-blue">medulla oblongata</span> down through vertebral column. It transmits nerve impulses between the brain and other parts of the body, and serves as the <u>reflex centre</u> for reflex actions involving the trunk and the limbs.

*Distribution of grey matter and white matter*:
- **Grey matter**: Makes up the <span class="hi-green">inner H-shaped region</span> containing cell bodies of neurones.
	- It has a <span class="hi-blue">central canal</span> filled with <span class="hi-blue">cerebrospinal fluid</span> running through the entire length of the spinal cord. It is continuous with the cavities in the brain.
- **White matter**: Makes up the <span class="hi-green">outer region</span> which consists of nerve fibres.

## Spinal nerves
![[spinal_nerves.webp]]

- **Dorsal root**: Contains <span class="hi-blue">sensory neurones</span> whose cell bodies are located in the <span class="hi-blue">dorsal root ganglion</u>, transmitting nerve impulses from receptors to the spinal cord.
- **Ventral root**: Contains <span class="hi-blue">motor neurones</span> whose cell bodies are located in the <span class="hi-blue">grey matter</span> of the spinal cord, transmitting nerve impulses from the spinal cord to effectors.
