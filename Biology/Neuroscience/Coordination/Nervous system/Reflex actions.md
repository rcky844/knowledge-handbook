**Reflex actions** are rapid automatic responses to a stimulus, allowing the body to respond quickly and protect us from danger.

*Characteristics*:
- <span class="hi-green">Stereotyped</span>: Same stimulus always lead to the same response.
- <span class="hi-green">Involuntary</span>: They are not under the control of the cerebrum.
- <span class="hi-green">Inborn & No prior learning</span> is required.

# Functioning
In humans, both the <u>medulla oblongata and spinal cord</u> serve as <span class="hi-blue">reflex centres</span>.
- **Medulla**: Sneezing, coughing, saliva secretion, swallowing, etc.
- **Spinal cord**: Spinal reflexes, withdrawal reflex, knee jerk reflex

A reflex action involves a <span class="hi-blue">reflex arc</span>, the nervous pathway along which nerve impulses travel for the reflex action to take place.

*Components*:
- A receptor
- A sensory neurone
- An interneurone (may be absent)
- A motor neurone
- An effector

# Examples
## Withdrawal reflex
The **withdrawal reflex** is an <span class="hi-green">automatic response</span> to withdraw a limb from a <span class="hi-green">painful stimulus</span>, protecting us from being injured (when touching a hot or sharp object accidentally with a hand).

> [!note]
> The receptor is linked to the effector by only three neurones: <u>sensory neurone, interneurone and motor neurone</u>. Nerve impulses can travel through the reflex arc <span class="hi-green">very quickly</span> (in < 0.1 s).

- **Sensation of pain**
  The cerebrum receives information from the sensory neurone through another interneurone not part of the reflex arc. Sensation of pain is felt <u>after the hand has been withdrawn</u> as the nerve impulse takes longer to travel to the cerebrum.

- **Overcoming reflex action**
  The reflex action <u>can be overcome voluntarily</u> via another interneurone of another nervous pathway that forms a synapse with the motor neurone, which allows the cerebrum to transmit nerve impulses from the cerebrum to initiate voluntary movement of the arm.

## Knee-jerk reflex
When the tendon just below the knee cap is tapped, a hanging leg will give a little kick automatically. This helps <span class="hi-green">maintain body posture and balance</span> during walking.

> [!note]
> The receptor is linked to the effector by only two neurones: <u>a sensory neurone and a motor neurone</u>.

- **Sensation of tapping**
  An interneurone of another nervous pathway forms a <span class="hi-blue">synapse</span> with the sensory neurone in the reflex arc, nerve impulses are transmitted to the cerebrum.
