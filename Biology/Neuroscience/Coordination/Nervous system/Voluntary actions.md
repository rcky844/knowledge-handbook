**Voluntary actions** are conscious actions that are under conscious control of the <span class="hi-blue">cerebrum</span>.

*Characteristics*:
- Do not take place automatically and are <span class="hi-green">not stereotyped</span>
- Can take place <span class="hi-green">without stimulation of receptors</span>, but caused by nerve impulses generated in the cerebrum

# Nervous pathway
![[voluntary_nervous_path.webp|600]]

1. Receptors detect a stimulus and generate nerve impulses.
2. The nerve impulses are transmitted along the sensory neurones to the sensory areas of the cerebrum.
3. The association areas of the cerebrum integrate nerve impulses from different receptors or sensory areas and relate them to past experiences. When a decision is made, nerve impulses are generated and transmitted to the motor areas.
4. The motor areas of the cerebrum generate and send nerve impulses along motor neurones to effectors.
5. The effectors produce responses.
