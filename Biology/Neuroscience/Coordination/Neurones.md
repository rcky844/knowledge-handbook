A **neurone** consists of a cell body and two types of nerve fibres (dendrons and axons).

![[neurone.webp]]

The <span style="color: lightgreen">cell body</span> contains the nucleus and a variety of [[Sub-cellular structures in cells|organelles]].

The <span style="color: lightgreen">nerve fibres</span> are cytoplasmic processes (extensions) extending from the cell body.
- <span style="color: violet">Dendons</span> transmit nerve impulses <u>towards the cell body</u>.
  They can form branches called <span style="color: violet">dendrites</span> to receive information from a number of neurones.
- <span style="color: violet">Axons</span> transmit nerve impulses <u>away from the cell body</u>.

#### Adaptations for transmitting nerve impulses

- **A neurone has long nerve fibres.**
  This is to transmit nerve impulses <span style="color: lightgreen">over a long distance</span>.

- **A dendron has many branches (dendrites).**
  This is to receive information from other neurones so that each neurone can <span style="color: lightgreen">communicate with many others</span>.

- **Most nerve fibres are surrounded by a lipid covering called the myelin sheath.**
  This is to <u>protect and insulate the nerve fibres, so that the loss of nerve impulses to the surroundings can be prevented</u>. It can also <span style="color: lightgreen">speed up the transmission of nerve impulses</span>.

> **Note**:
> Nerve fibres surrounded by the myelin sheath is referred to as myelinated.

#### Types of neurones
![[neurones_type.webp]]

- **Sensory neurones**
  They transmit nerve impulses <u>from receptors to the CNS</u>.
  They have an <u>oval-shaped cell body lying outside the CNS</u>, with a <u>long dendron</u> and a <u>short axon</u>.

- **Motor neurones**
  They transmit nerve impulses <u>from the CNS to effectors</u> (e.g. muscles and glands).
  They have an <u>irregularly shaped cell body lying outside the CNS</u>, with a number of <u>very short dendrons</u> and <u>long axons</u>.

- **Interneurones**
  They transmit nerve impulses <u>within the CNS</u>.
  They have an <u>irregularly shaped cell body lying inside the CNS</u>, with <u>short dendrons</u> and <u>short axons</u>.
  
#### Structure of a nerve
![[nerve.webp|500]]
![[nerve_photomicrograph.webp|200]]

- A nerve is made up of bundles of nerve fibres wrapped in tough connective tissue.
- Some nerves consists of nerve fibres of either sensory or motor neurones only.
  (e.g. <span style="color: violet">optic nerve</span> is a cranial nerve consisting of nerve fibres of sensory neurones only)
- However, spinal nerves consist of nerve fibres of both sensory and motor neurones.

#### Transmission of nerve impulses
A **synapse** is the junction between two neurones. Transmission of nerve impulses from one neurone to another is done by means of neurotransmitters.

![[synapse_transmission.webp]]

The <span style="color: lightgreen">synaptic knob</span> is a swollen structure located at the end of an axon. It has numerous [[Mitochondria]] for energy production and contains <span style="color: violet">synaptic vesicles</span> to store neurotransmitters.

The <span style="color: lightgreen">synaptic cleft</span> is a tiny gap that separates the neurones. There is no physical contact between neurones, nerve impulses cannot travel directly to the next neurone. There are also [[Enzymes]] present in the synaptic cleft.

> **Note**:
> - The enzymes in the synaptic cleft is specific in action and <u>breaks down neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft</u>.
> - This <u>prevents repeated nerve impulses from being generated</u> when the dendron is <u>continuously stimulated</u>.

##### Importance of synapses
- **Unidirectional transmission of nerve impulses**
	- *Description*: Synapses ensure that nerve impulses are transmitted in one direction only (from axon of one neurone to dendron of the next neurone).
	- *Explanation*: Only synaptic knobs can secrete neurotransmitters and only dendrons have receptor sites for binding with neurotransmitters.

- **Formation of neural networks**
	- Synapses allow one neurone to communicate with many other neurones to form neural networks. This allows complex coordination between receptors and effectors.
