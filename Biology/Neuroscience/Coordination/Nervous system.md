The human nervous system can be divided into two parts:
- **Central nervous system (CNS)**
  Consisting of the brain and the spinal cord, it serves as the processor in nervous coordination, receiving sensory signals in the form of nerve impulses from receptors in different parts of the body, then interpreting the nerve impulses and initiating responses.

- **Peripheral nervous system (PNS)**
  Consisting of nerves outside the CNS, they are named from where they arise:
	- **Cranial nerves** arise from the brain, linking the brain with receptors and effectors in the head and the neck. (e.g. optic nerves and auditory nerves)
	- **Spinal nerves** arise from the spinal cord, linking the spinal cord with receptors and effectors in the rest of the body.
