# Body temperature

![[homeostasis_body_temperature.webp|450]]

**Importance in keeping the parameter stable**:
- To maintain a stable <span class="hi-green">optimal temperature</span> for [[enzymes]] to work in <u>metabolic reactions</u>.

**Effects of extreme conditions**:
- Enzymes become inactive at low temperatures, while they are denatured at high temperatures. Body [[metabolism]] is affected, which may lead to death.

**Organ(s) involved in homeostatic control**:
- [[Physical barriers#Skin|Skin]] — Helps regulate the body temperature at around 37°C

# Water and salt content in the blood
*See also: [[Urinary system]]*

![[homeostasis_water_salt.webp|350]]

**Importance in keeping the parameter stable**:
- Maintains a stable <span class="hi-green">water potential</span> for blood and tissue fluid so that cells can function properly.

**Effects of extreme conditions**:
- Differences in water potential of blood or tissue fluid surrounding the cells determines the net movement of water into and out of the cell by [[osmosis]].

**Organ(s) involved in homeostatic control**:
- [[Urinary system#Kidneys|Kidneys]] — Filters the blood and removes excess water and salts from the body

# Gas content in blood
*See also: [[Breathing system]]*

**Importance in keeping the parameter stable**:
- Ensures that a <span class="hi-green">sufficient supply of oxygen</span> for cells to carry out [[respiration]] in order to obtain energy.
- Maintains a <span class="hi-green">stable content of carbonic acid</span> (carbon dioxide) in blood and tissue fluid for a stable pH.

**Effects of extreme conditions**:
- Insufficient oxygen supply affects [[respiration]] and can damage nerve cells and the heart over time.
- A build-up of carbon dioxide would lower the pH (increase the acidity) of blood and tissue fluid, affecting [[Effects of pH level on enzymatic reactions|enzyme activity in cells]].

**Organ(s) involved in homeostatic control**:
- [[Breathing system|Lungs]] — Helps take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide
- [[Heart]] — Ensures adequate blood flow carrying oxygenated blood to all parts of the body

> They receive signals from the brain to change the breathing rate and heart rate when necessary.

# Glucose level in blood
*Main article: [[Blood glucose levels and regulation]]*

**Importance in keeping the parameter stable**:
- Ensures a <span class="hi-green">sufficient supply of glucose</span> for cells to carry out [[respiration]] in order to obtain energy.
- Maintains a stable <span class="hi-green">water potential</span> of blood and tissue fluid.

**Effects of extreme conditions**:
- Glucose is the main <span class="hi-blue">respiratory substrate</span>, inadequate supply affects respiration of cells, resulting in dizziness or even death when the brain does not have enough glucose supply.
- Glucose is soluble in water and affects the water potential of the blood. Differences in water potential of blood or tissue fluid surrounding the cells determine the net movement of water into and out of the cells by [[osmosis]].

> [!note]
> Starch is insoluble in water, so it does not affect the water potential of a solution.

**Organ(s) involved in homeostatic control**:
- [[Pancreas]]
- [[Assimilation|Liver]]
