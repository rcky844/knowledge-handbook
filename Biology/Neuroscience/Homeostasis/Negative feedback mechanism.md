In a **negative feedback mechanism**, <u>any changes in a parameter</u> triggers a <span style="color: lightgreen">corrective response</span> that has the <span style="color: lightgreen">opposed effect</span> to bring the the parameter <u>back to normal (set point)</u>.

In humans, it operates with interactions of three components:
- **Receptors**
  To detect changes in the internal environment

- **Control centre (nervous system / endocrine system)**
  To receive information from the receptors and coordinates a response with reference to a set point.

- **Effectors**
  To produce a response to reverse any changes in the internal environment.
