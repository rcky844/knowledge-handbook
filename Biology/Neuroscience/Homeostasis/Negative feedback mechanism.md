In a **negative feedback mechanism**, <u>any changes in a parameter</u> triggers a <span class="hi-green">corrective response</span> that has the <span class="hi-green">opposed effect</span> to bring the the parameter back to <span class="hi-blue">normal (set point)</span>.

# Interactions of components
- **Receptors**: Detect changes in the internal environment.
- **Control centre**: Receive information from the receptors and coordinates a response with reference to a set point. (nervous system / endocrine system)
- **Effectors**: Produce a response to reverse any changes in the internal environment.

# Examples
- [[Blood glucose levels and regulation]]
- [[Osmoregulation]] (ADH)
- [[Control of heartbeat#Rate and depth of breathing]]
- [[Mechanism of body temperature regulation|Body temperature regulation]]
