In a **negative feedback mechanism**, <u>any changes in a parameter</u> triggers a <span class="hi-blue">corrective response</span> that has the <span class="hi-blue">opposed effect</span> to bring the the parameter back to <span class="hi-blue">normal (set point)</span>.

*Interactions of three components*:
- **Receptors**
  To detect changes in the internal environment.

- **Control centre** (nervous system / endocrine system)
  To receive information from the receptors and coordinates a response with reference to a set point.

- **Effectors**
  To produce a response to reverse any changes in the internal environment.
