**Blood glucose levels** are regulated by a [[negative feedback mechanism]] through the actions of protein hormones insulin and glucagon, secreted by the <span class="hi-blue">pancreas</u>.

The pancreas detect changes in blood glucose levels and control the secretion of these hormones. Glucose level is regulated at a <span class="hi-blue">set point</span> of around $\pu{90 mg / 100 cm3}$ of blood.

# Insulin
**Insulin** is a protein hormone that has the following functions:
- Stimulates <span class="hi-blue">liver cells</span> to <span class="hi-green">convert <u>more</u> glucose to glycogen</span>
- Stimulates <span class="hi-blue">body cells and liver cells</span> to <span class="hi-green">take up <u>more</u> glucose from the blood</span>
- Increases [[respiration]] in cells to <span class="hi-green">consume glucose</span>
- <span class="hi-green">Inhibits the secretion of glucagon</span>

Overall, <u>insulin causes blood glucose level to decrease.</u>

# Glucagon
**Glucagon** is a protein hormone that stimulates <span class="hi-blue">liver cells</span> to <span class="hi-green">convert <u>more</u> glycogen to glucose</span>.

Overall, <u>glucagon causes blood glucose level to increase.</u>
