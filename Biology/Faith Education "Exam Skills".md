Name structure X and describe its function. (3 marks)
- Name (1 mark)
- Describe (2 marks)
	- Enclosing the lungs would not be a function.

Construct a flowchart to show the path of air passing from the atmosphere to the air sacs of the lungs. (2 marks)
- Flowcharts require arrows "→"
- Extracted details: Atmosphere → ______ → Air sac of the lungs
- All or zero marks

Asthma is a respiratory disease. When it attacks, structure Y constricts and the patient will have breathing difficulty. Explain the effect of asthma on the rate of removal of carbon dioxide from the blood of the lungs. (4 marks)
- Identify structure Y: bronchiole
- "Constricts": Lumen size becomes smaller
- Difficulties breathing in and breathing out
	- **2 ways to the answer, only 1 is absolutely required**
	- However, breathing out is better for this question (removal of carbon dioxide)
- Identifying details:
	- Effect of asthema → Rate of removal of $\ce{CO2}$ (**State the effect! (Not stated in the question)** - lower)
## Detailed processes
- Recall the "breathing difficulty" {breathing in / **breathing out**}
- **Volume of expired air?** Any change?
- How will the **amount of $\ce{CO2}$ removed from air sacs** to atmosphere **change**?
- How will the **concentration of $\ce{CO2}$ inside the air sacs change**?
- What will be the **concentration gradient of $\ce{CO2}$** between the alveolar air and the blood? (**diffusion** as transport process!)
- So, the **rate of $\ce{CO2}$ removal from the blood** will become...

 Explain the change of breathing rate and depth when a person is doing vigorous exercise. (4 marks)
	- **State the changes in breathing rate!**

# Osmosis
In the experiment studying osmosis in **plant cells**, five freshly cut potato strips with the **same size and weight** were put in sucrose solutions of different concentrations. After one day, the strips were taken out and reweighed. The results were presented in the following graph:
![[055f28369ea2345a7c9ff138d4d4d54a.webp|380]]
- Note the type of cell (animal cell / plant cell)
- Control variable: "same size and weight"
- Dependent variable: Ratio of final weight and initial weight
- Independent variable: Conc. of sucrose solution

With reference to the graph, state and explain the change of potato strip when it was placed in distilled waiter (4 marks).
