# Light microscope
![[light_microscope.webp|500]]
- **Light source**: Transmitted light passes through the specimen
- **Sample / Specimen**: Living or dead cells
- **View of image**: Two-dimensional, colour images
- **Resolution / Magnification**: Lowest, sub-cellular structures cannot be observed
- **Preparation of samples**:
	- Sample do not need to be fixed and processed.
	- Ultra-thin sections are not needed.

- **Total magnification of a compound microscope**:
  Magnification of eyepiece  x  Magnification of objective
- Image formed is inverted upside down and reversed laterally.

# Transmission electron microscope (TEM)
- **Light source**: Electron beams passes through the specimen
- **Sample / Specimen**: Dead cells
- **View of image**: Two-dimensional, black and white images
- **Resolution / Magnification**: Highest, sub-cellular structures can be observed
- **Preparation of samples**:
	- Samples have to be fixed and sectioned in order to preserve and stabilise cell structures.
	- Ultra-thin sections must be used.

# Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
- **Light source**: Electrons bounce off the specimen
- **Sample / Specimen**: Dead cells
- **View of image**: Three-dimensional, black and white images
- **Resolution / Magnification**: Moderate, only surface features can be observed
- **Preparation of samples**:
	- Samples have to be fixed and coated with a thin layer of heavy metal in order to preserve and stabilise cell structure.
	- Ultra-thin sections are not needed.
