The **endoplasmic reticulum** (ER) is an <span style="color: lightgreen">extensive network of interconnected membrane-bound sacs</span> that extends from the outer nuclear envelope to the periphery of the cell (i.e. cell membrane).

**Specialised types of ER**:
- <span style="color: skyblue">Rough endoplasmic reticulum</span>
	- A series of convoluted, flattened membranes.
	- Attached with [[Ribosomes]] on the surface.
	- Transports [[Proteins]] produced at the ribosomes.
	- Large quantities are present in protein-secreting cells.
	  (e.g. cells that secrete insulin in the pancreas)

- <span style="color: skyblue">Smooth endoplasmic reticulum</span>
	- <span style="color: lightgreen">A network of folded / stacked membranes</span> that <span style="color: yellowgreen">provides a large surface area for various enzymes to align for carrying out metabolic processes</span>.
	- Involved in the synthesis and transport of [[Lipids]] within the cytoplasm.
	- Large quantities are present in lipid-secreting cells.
	  (e.g. cells that secrete male sex hormones in the testes / Leydig cells)
