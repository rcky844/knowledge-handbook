The **endoplasmic reticulum** (ER) is an <span class="hi-green">extensive network of interconnected membrane-bound sacs</span> that extends from the outer nuclear envelope to the periphery of the cell (i.e. cell membrane).

*Specialised types of ER*:
- **Rough endoplasmic reticulum**
	- A series of convoluted, flattened membranes.
	- Attached with [[ribosomes]] on the surface.
	- Transports [[proteins]] produced at the ribosomes.
	- Large quantities are present in protein-secreting cells.
	  (e.g. cells that secrete insulin in the pancreas)

- **Smooth endoplasmic reticulum**
	- A <span class="hi-blue">network of folded / stacked membranes</span> that <span class="hi-green">provides a large surface area for various enzymes to align for carrying out metabolic processes</span>.
	- Involved in the synthesis and transport of [[lipids]] within the cytoplasm.
	- Large quantities are present in lipid-secreting cells.
	  (e.g. cells that secrete male sex hormones in the testes / Leydig cells)
