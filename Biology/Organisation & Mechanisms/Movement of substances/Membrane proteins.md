**Membrane proteins** occur on the surfaces of the bilayer. Some extend into or span completely through the bilayer.

# Types
*Channel proteins*: 
- Form pores through which <span class="hi-green">water, ions and water-soluble molecules</span> may pass through.

> [!note]
> Each type of channel protein has a specific internal diameter and distribution of charges, allowing only particular types of ions or molecules to pass through. This give rise to the [[Cell membrane#Differentially permeable|differentially permeable]] property of cell membranes.

*Carrier proteins*:
- Involved in [[active transport]] and facilitated [[diffusion]].

*[[Enzymes]]*:
- Located <u>either</u> on the <span class="hi-orange">outer or inner surface</span> of the membrane.
- Helps to <span class="hi-green">speed up chemical reactions</span> (e.g. in small intestine, mitochondria).

*Receptor proteins*:
- Located on the <span class="hi-orange">outer surface</span> of the cell membrane.
- Binds with chemicals (e.g. hormones, neurotransmitters) that <span class="hi-green">triggers or inhibit cellular activities</span>.

*Glycoproteins*:
- Attached to the <span class="hi-orange">outer surface</span> of the cell membrane.
- Act as <span class="hi-blue">recognition markers</span> for [[Lymphocytes|white blood cells]] to recognise (especially on bacterial cells and other pathogens), allowing it to <span class="hi-green">trigger immune responses to destroy invading pathogens or "foreign" bodies</span>.
- The variations in number and pattern gives each cell type a <span class="hi-orange">unique identity label</span>.

# Functions
- **Glycoproteins**: Serve as [[antigens]] for cell recognition / recognition of pathogens
- **Enzymes**: For cellular [[metabolism]]
- **Carrier proteins**: Act as carriers which transport some substances across the membrane (e.g. absorption of glucose in the [[small intestines]])
- **Receptor proteins**: Transmission of nerve impulses across a [[Neurones#Transmission of nerve impulses|synapse]]
