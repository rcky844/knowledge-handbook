In **diffusion**, molecules will <u>move down a conc. gradient from a region of higher conc. to a region of lower conc. until they are evenly distributed</u> (achieved [[equilibrium]]). The rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the concentration gradient.

The process takes place passively and depends on kinetic energy. It <u>does not require energy from respiration</u>, nor does it require a membrane.

**Diffusion** is used mostly for the movement of gases in organisms (e.g. [[Gas exchange in the air sacs|gas exchange|]] in [[Lungs and associated structures|lungs]]).

#### Across a membrane
- Small and non-polar molecules (e.g. oxygen, carbon dioxide) diffuse directly through the bilayer down a conc. gradient without using energy from [[Respiration]] in the cell.
- Polar molecules (e.g. [[Proteins|amino acids]], [[Carbohydrates#Monosaccharides|glucose]]) diffuse through [[Membrane proteins|channel proteins or carrier proteins]] without using energy from [[Respiration]] in the cell by <u>facilitated diffusion</u>.

#### Importance to organisms
- Useful substances (e.g. oxygen, nutrients in extracellular fluid) can diffuse into the cells.
- Metabolic wastes (e.g. carbon dioxide) can diffuse out of the cells.
This helps distribute substances within the cytoplasm.

#### Factors that affect the rate of diffusion
1. **Concentration gradient**
2. **Diffusion distance**
	- Diffusion is only effective over very short distances, because the further the distance between the two concentrations, the rate of diffusion decreases.
3. **Surface area**
4. **Temperature**
	- Particles possess higher kinetic energy at higher temperatures.
5. **Small and soluble molecules**
   Non-polar, lipid-soluble molecules diffuses through cell membranes more rapidly than polar, water-soluble molecules.
	- Non-polar molecules can diffuse directly through the bilayer down a conc. gradient.
	- Polar molecules cannot diffuse directly through the bilayer, it has to diffuse through polar channel proteins or carrier proteins by <u>facilitated diffusion</u>.
