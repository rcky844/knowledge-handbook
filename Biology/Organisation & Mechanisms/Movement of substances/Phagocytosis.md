Process of phagocytosis and [[exocytosis]] ⤴️

**Phagocytosis** is a process in cells to <u>take in large solid particles or other cells and requires energy from respiration</u>.

During the process, the cell membrane folds in to form a pit and extends out to form extensions called <u>pseudopodia</u> to enclose the particles in a vacuole. It is possible due to the flexible, fluid nature of the cell membrane.

# Importance
- Helps with <u>body defence</u> against diseases in white blood cells (phagocytes).
  *See also: [[Phagocytosis (body defence)]]*

- As a means of <u>feeding</u> used by some unicellular organisms (e.g. *Amoeba*).
