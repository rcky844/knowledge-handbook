When in water or aqueous solution, the **cell membrane** is a [[Lipids#Phospholipids|phospholipid]] bilayer surrounding all cells.
- It consists mainly of phospholipid molecules and interspersed protein molecules.
- It is <span class="hi-blue">differentially permeable</span>, allowing control of the movement of substances into and out of the cell.

The <span class="hi-blue">fluid mosaic model</span> is a scientific model proposed to explain the structure of the cell membrane.
- The bilayer is <span class="hi-green">fluid in nature</span>, phospholipid molecules and some protein molecules can <span class="hi-green">move laterally</span>.
- Proteins are <span class="hi-green">interspersed</span> within the bilayer and distributed in a <span class="hi-green">mosaic pattern / asymmetric manner</span>.

1. [[Phospholipid (Cell membrane)|Phospholipid]]
2. [[Membrane proteins]]

# Properties & functions
## Flexibility
The phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane are capable of slight lateral movements, hence providing the cell membrane its fluid nature.
- This allows the cell membrane to <span class="hi-green">fold in</span> (invaginate) / carry out [[phagocytosis]].
- This allows the <span class="hi-green">fusion of membranes</span>, allowing for <span class="hi-green">export of materials</span> by exocytosis.
- It <span class="hi-green">allows the cells to change shape</span> during cell growth, [[Nuclear division|cell division]] and [[phagocytosis]].

> [!tip]
> Phospholipid molecules are <u>not chemically bonded</u>, but only held by weak [[Van der Waals' forces|intermolecular forces]], which allows it to move slightly. (Fluid in nature)

## Strength
The cell membrane is thin but strong enough to hold the cell contents. This is because:
- [[Van der Waals' forces|Intermolecular forces]] between large numbers of molecules are collectively strong.
- Protein molecules among the phospholipid bilayer provide strength.
- <span class="hi-blue">Cholesterol</span> plays pivotal roles in maintaining the structural integrity and regulating the fluidity of cell membranes.

## Differentially permeable
*See also: [[Movement of substances across membrane]]*

   ![[cell_membrane_permeability.webp|500]]
- Cell membrane is <u>permeable to small, non-polar molecules</u> (e.g. oxygen, carbon dioxide) and <u>lipid-soluble substances</u> (e.g. alcohol, lipid soluble vitamins and lipid hormones), as they can dissolve in the bilayer.
- Cell membrane is <u>impermeable to ions and polar molecules</u> (e.g. water, water-soluble substances), as they are repelled by the bilayer. Instead, they move across the cell membrane through [[Membrane proteins|channel proteins or carrier proteins]].

## Bilayer structure
Due to the hydrophobic nature of fatty acids, phospholipid form a bilayer in aqueous situations.
- The bilayer makes the membrane a <span class="hi-green">good physical barrier for compartmentalization</span> and can help <span class="hi-green">restrict the entry / exit of ions and polar molecules</span>, thus establishing concentration gradients across membranes.
- The bilayer <span class="hi-green">forms a structural framework for embedment of proteins</span>.
