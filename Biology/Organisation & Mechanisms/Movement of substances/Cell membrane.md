The **cell membrane** is a <span class="hi-blue">differentially permeable</span> [[Lipids#Phospholipids|phospholipid]] <u>bilayer</u> surrounding all cells formed in aqueous medium.

# Structure
![[cell_membrane_arrangement.webp]]

*Components*:
1. [[Phospholipid (Cell membrane)|Phospholipid]]
2. [[Membrane proteins]]

*Scientific model*: <span class="hi-blue">Fluid mosaic model</span> explains the structure of the cell membrane.
- The bilayer is <span class="hi-orange">fluid in nature</span>, phospholipid molecules and some protein molecules can <span class="hi-green">move laterally</span>.
- Proteins are <span class="hi-orange">interspersed</span> within the bilayer and distributed in a <span class="hi-green">mosaic pattern / asymmetric manner</span>.

# Properties & functions
## Flexibility
Phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane are capable of slight <span class="hi-orange">lateral movements</span>, hence providing the cell membrane its fluid nature.
- This allows the cell membrane to <span class="hi-green">fold in</span> (invaginate) / carry out [[phagocytosis]].
- This allows the <span class="hi-green">fusion of membranes</span>, allowing for <span class="hi-green">export of materials</span> by exocytosis.
- It <span class="hi-green">allows the cells to change shape</span> during cell growth, [[Nuclear division|cell division]] and [[phagocytosis]].

> [!tip]
> Phospholipid molecules are <u>not chemically bonded</u>, but only held by weak [[Van der Waals' forces|intermolecular forces]], which allows it to move slightly. (Fluid in nature)

## Strength
The cell membrane is thin but strong enough to hold the cell contents.
- [[Van der Waals' forces|Intermolecular forces]] between large numbers of molecules are collectively strong.
- Protein molecules among the phospholipid bilayer provide strength.
- <span class="hi-blue">Cholesterol</span> plays pivotal roles in maintaining the structural integrity and regulating the fluidity of cell membranes.

## Differentially permeable

   ![[cell_membrane_permeability.webp|500]]
- Cell membrane is <span class="hi-green">permeable to small, non-polar molecules</span> (e.g. oxygen, carbon dioxide) and <span class="hi-green">lipid-soluble substances</span> (e.g. alcohol, lipid soluble vitamins and lipid hormones), as they can dissolve in the bilayer.
- Cell membrane is <span class="hi-green">impermeable to ions and polar molecules</span> (e.g. water, water-soluble substances), as they are repelled by the bilayer. Instead, they move across the cell membrane through [[Membrane proteins|channel proteins or carrier proteins]].

## Bilayer structure
*See also: [[Phospholipid (Cell membrane)#Arrangement in cell membranes]]*

- The bilayer makes the membrane a <span class="hi-green">good physical barrier for compartmentalization</span> and can help <span class="hi-green">restrict the entry / exit of ions and polar molecules</span>, thus establishing concentration gradients across membranes.
- The bilayer <span class="hi-green">forms a structural framework for embedment of proteins</span>.
