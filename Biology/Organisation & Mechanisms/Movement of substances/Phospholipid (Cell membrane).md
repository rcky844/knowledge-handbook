# Structure
![[phospholipids_cell_membrane.webp|180]]

*Phosphate group*: Hydrophilic / water-loving
- Polar and attracted to polar molecules (e.g. water)

*Fatty acids*: Hydrophobic / water-hating
- Non-polar and repel polar molecules (e.g. water)

# Arrangement in cell membranes
- **Hydrophobic tails** <span class="hi-green">point inwards</span> towards each other.
- **Hydrophilic heads** face the <span class="hi-green">aqueous medium</span> inside and outside the cell (cell sap in cytoplasm and extracellular fluid respectively).
