# Structure
![[phospholipids_cell_membrane.webp|180]]

*Phosphate group*: Hydrophilic
- Polar and attracted to polar molecules (e.g. water)

*Fatty acids*: Hydrophobic
- Non-polar and repel polar molecules (e.g. water)

# Arrangement in cell membranes
![[cell_membrane_arrangement.webp]]

- **Hydrophobic tails** point inwards.
- **Hydrophilic heads** face the watery environment inside and outside the cell (aqueous solution in cytoplasm and extracellular fluid respectively).
