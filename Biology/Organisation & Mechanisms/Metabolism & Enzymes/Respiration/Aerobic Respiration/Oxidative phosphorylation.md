**Oxidative phosphorylation** is the last stage of [[aerobic respiration]]. It takes place on the inner membrane of the [[mitochondria]] and uses the energy released by the oxidation of $\ce{NADH}$ and $\ce{FADH2}$ to phosphorylate ADP to ATP.

1. **Regeneration of NAD and FAD**
	- $\ce{NADH}$ and $\ce{FADH2}$ is oxidized to NAD and FAD respectively for usage in [[glycolysis]] and the [[Krebs cycle]].
	- Hydrogen atoms are donated by reduced NAD and FAD.

2. **Electron transport and ATP formation**
   *See also: [[Role of NAD and FAD]]*
	- Hydrogen atoms <u>split into protons</u> ($\ce{H+}$) <u>and electrons</u> ($\ce{e-}$).
	- The high energy electrons release energy as they move through the <span class="hi-blue">electron transport chain</span>.
	- The released energy is used to <span class="hi-green">transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane</span> from the matrix into the intermembrane space.
	- A concentration gradient of protons is established between the intermembrane space and the matrix.
	- The protons return to the matrix via <span class="hi-green">facilitated diffusion</span> through the channel protein <span class="hi-blue">ATP synthase</span>.
	- <u>The movement of protons down their concentration gradient provides energy for ATP synthesis.</u>

3. **Formation of water**
	- Oxygen is the <u>final electron acceptor</u> in the electron transport chain.
	- It combines with protons and electrons at the end of the electron transport chain from $\ce{NADH}$ and $\ce{FADH2}$ to form water.

> [!warning]
> Without oxygen, electron transport chain will stop functioning, and NAD and FAD cannot be regenerated. The [[link reaction]] and the [[Krebs cycle]] will stop.
