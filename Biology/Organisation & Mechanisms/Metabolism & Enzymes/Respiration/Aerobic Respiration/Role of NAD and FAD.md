**Coenzymes NAD and FAD** <u>transfer</u> the hydrogen atoms (<u>hydrogen ions and electrons</u>) from the different stages of respiration to the electron transport chain on the inner mitochondrial membrane (in the form of $\ce{NADH}$ and $\ce{FADH2}$), the site where hydrogen is removed from the coenzymes (oxidised).

Hydrogen ions and electrons are important in the electron transport chain at the end of respiration as they play a role in the synthesis of ATP.

*Reduced NAD*:
- 2 x 1 = 2 from [[glycolysis]]
- 2 x 1 = 2 from the [[link Reaction]]
- 2 x 3 = 6 from the [[Krebs cycle]]

*Reduced FAD*:
- 2 x 1 = 2 from the [[Krebs cycle]]

> [!note]
> At all stages there is a doubling (2x) of reduced NAD and FAD. This is because one glucose molecule is split in two in [[glycolysis]] and so these reactions occur twice per single molecule of glucose.
