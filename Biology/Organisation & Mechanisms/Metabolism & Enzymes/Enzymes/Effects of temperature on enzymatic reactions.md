*At low temperatures*:
- At low temperatures, the <u>kinetic energy</u> of both enzyme and substrates are low.
- The <u>chance</u> they <u>collide</u> with each other to form the enzyme-substrate complex is low too.
- Enzymes are <span class="hi-blue">inactive</span> at this moment.

*As temperature rises to optimum temperature*:
- As temperature rises, the substrate and enzyme molecules have <u>more kinetic energy</u> and <u>collide more often</u>.
- <u>Enzyme-substrate complexes</u> are more likely to form. The <u>rate of enzymatic reaction</u> increases.
- The rate of enzymatic reaction reaches its maximum at its <u>optimum temperature</u>.

*At temperature above the optimum temperature*:
- <u>Enzymes are protein in nature</u>, high temperatures break the bonds between amino acids.
- This changes the <u>shape/conformation of the enzyme</u>, the <u>active site is no longer complementary to the substrate molecule</u>.
- The enzyme is <span class="hi-blue">denatured</span>.
