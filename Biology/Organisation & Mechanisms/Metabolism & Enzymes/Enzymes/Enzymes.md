**Enzymes** are proteins that act as biological <span class="hi-blue">catalysts</span>. The substances they act on are referred to as substrates. They are often named by the reactions they catalyse or substrates, and ends with 'ase'.

To start any chemical reactions, sufficient activation energy must be supplied to the reactants. Enzymes provide a reaction pathway with lower activation energy in order to allow the reaction to occur and/or speed up the reaction. Note that the energy levels of both reactants and products are not changed by the action of enzymes.

# Mechanism
![[enzymes_mechanism.webp|500]]
Each enzyme has an <span class="hi-blue">active site</span> with a specific shape. When the substrate collide with the enzyme and binds to the active site of the enzyme, an <span class="hi-blue">enzyme-substrate complex</span> is formed. This allows the reaction to proceed with lower activation energy.

Enzymes have <u>specificity to the substrate</u> it can act on. Only <span class="hi-blue">substrate with complementary shape</span> can bind to the enzyme to form an enzyme-substrate complex. The <span class="hi-green">'lock-and-key' model</span> is often used to explain the specificity of enzyme action.

The products are released once the reaction has completed, with the enzyme remaining unchanged and free to combine with other substrates.

# Properties of enzymes
- Enzymes are <span class="hi-green">protein molecules</span> and remain active outside the body.
- Enzymes serve as biological [[catalysts]] to speed up (catalyse) [[Metabolism|metabolic reactions]] in organisms <span class="hi-green">without being used up or chemically altered</span>.
- Enzymes are <span class="hi-green">reusable</span> after the reactions and required in small amounts.
- Enzymes are <span class="hi-green">highly specific in action</span>, one type of enzyme catalyses only one type of reaction.
- Enzyme activity is <span class="hi-green">affected by temperature and pH</span> because they are proteins.
  It will undergo an irreversible process called <span class="hi-blue">denaturation</span> if the conditions are not suitable.

> [!note]
> The rate of enzymatic reactions are measured by the <u>rate at which substrates are used up or the rate at which products are formed</u>.
