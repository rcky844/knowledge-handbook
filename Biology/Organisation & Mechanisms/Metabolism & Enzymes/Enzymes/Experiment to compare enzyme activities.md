**Example**: HKDSE 2014 Paper 1B Q6(c)
*Describe* an experiment which can compare the different (digestive) amylase activities of wolves and dogs.

> [!note]
> The word "describe" implies that the process of the experiment should be provided.

*Preparation*:
Obtain the digestive juice from the mouth (/ intestine / pancreas) of a wolf and a dog.

*Iodine test*:
- **Method**: Mix the digestive juice with excess starch solution.
- **Test**: At regular time intervals, remove a fixed amount of the mixture for [[iodine test]] and record the time taken for the mixture to turn from brown to blue-black.
- **Observation**: The shorter the time taken, the faster the digestion of starch, the higher the amylase activity.

*Starch agar plate*:
- **Method**: Drill two holes on a starch agar plate, add the digestive juices to the holes of starch agar plate respectively.
- **Test**: Incubate the plate for 30 minutes, add iodine solution to the plate and rinse, compare the clear zones appeared.
- **Observation**: The plate that has the bigger clear zone shows more starch digestion, which means a higher amylase activity.

*Benedict's test*:
- **Method**: Mix the digestive juice with excess starch solution.
- **Test**: Allow 10 minutes for the reaction to take place, then boil the mixture with excess [[Benedict's test|Benedict's solution]], and record the amount of red precipitate formed.
- **Observation**: The mixture with more precipitate shows more maltose formation, which means a higher amylase activity.
