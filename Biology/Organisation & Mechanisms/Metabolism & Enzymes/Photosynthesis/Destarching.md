# Description & Procedures
- Before performing any [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]] experiments, a plant must be placed in the dark for 24 to 48 hours to destarch the plant.
- No photosynthesis occurs during the period, and no starch will be produced.
- During this period, any starch stored in the leaves is converted back to glucose and used up in respiration.

# Explanations
- If starch is present during the experiments, the results may be incorrect.
