**Photochemical reactions**, also called **light reactions**, are reactions driven by light energy that take place in the thylakoids of [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]] in plants. It is the first stage of [[photosynthesis]].

In the reaction, light energy is absorbed by [[chlorophyll]] and converted to chemical energy in the form of <span class="hi-blue">ATP and NADPH</span>. <span class="hi-green">Water is split, releasing oxygen as a by-product</span>.

## Light absorption and electron transport
![[photosynthesis_photochem_s1.webp|360]]

- Chlorophyll molecule in the thylakoid membrane absorbs light energy, which excites electrons to higher energy levels, <span class="hi-green">leaving the chlorophyll molecule</span>. They then pass through an electron transport chain in the <span class="hi-blue">thylakoid membrane</span>.
- The electron transport chain consists of a series of <span class="hi-blue">electron carriers</span> arranged in order of decreasing energy levels. As an electron passes from carriers of higher energy level to lower energy level, <span class="hi-green">energy is released</span>.

## Photophosphorylation â€“ synthesis of ATP
![[photosynthesis_photochem_s2.webp|420]]
- **Description**
  Catalysed by the enzyme <span class="hi-blue">ATP synthase</span>, some of the <span class="hi-green">energy</span> from electron transport is used to synthesize ATP (adenosine triphosphate) <u>from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate</u>.

- **Meaning of the naming**
  Phosphorylation: Addition of a phosphate to a molecule
  Photo-: Reaction is driven by energy coming from light

## Photolysis of water
- **Description**
  Catalysed by several enzymes, some of the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to <span class="hi-green">split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen</span>.

- **Process**
  Hydrogen is picked up by a NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) <span class="hi-green">hydrogen acceptor</span> to form <span class="hi-blue">NADPH</span>, which is reduced NADP.

- **By-product**
  Oxygen is produced as a by-product of the reaction. It is either used in [[respiration]] or released as a gas to the atmosphere.

# Products from photochemical reactions
Light energy is converted to chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, with the release of oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis.

## Uses of products in carbon fixation
- ATP will provide energy to drive the reactions of [[carbon fixation]].
- NADPH will act as a reducing agent, providing reducing power by donating hydrogen in [[carbon fixation]].
