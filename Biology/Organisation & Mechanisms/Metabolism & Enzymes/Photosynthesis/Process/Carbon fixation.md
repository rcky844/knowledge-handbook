**Carbon fixation** occurs in a cyclic series of reactions (called the **Calvin Cycle**) in the <span class="hi-blue">stroma</span> of [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]], in which <span class="hi-green">carbon atoms from carbon dioxide are incorporated into organic molecules</span>.

*Characteristics of reaction*:
- Do not require light
- <u>ATP provides energy</u> that drives several steps of the Calvin cycle
- <u>NADPH provides hydrogen</u> to reduce the 3-C compound to form glucose
- <u>ADP and NADP is regenerated</u> for reuse in [[photochemical reactions]]

## Carbon dioxide fixation and the formation of a 3-C compound
![[photosynthesis_carbon_fix_s1.webp|450]]
- In the stroma, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere <span class="hi-green">combine with a five-carbon (5-C) compound</span> (a carbon dioxide acceptor) to form <span class="hi-blue">two molecules of a 3-C compound</span>.

## Reduction of the 3-C compound and formation of glucose
![[photosynthesis_carbon_fix_s2.webp|450]]
- The 3-C compound is then reduced to a <span class="hi-blue">3-C sugar</span> called triose phosphate. This reaction <span class="hi-green">requires energy from ATP and hydrogen</span> from NADPH, both of which came from [[photochemical reactions]].
- Triose phosphate is the primary product of the Calvin cycle, some of them combine in pairs to form [[Carbohydrates (Photosynthesis)#Glucose|glucose]] (6-C).

## Regeneration of the carbon dioxide acceptor
![[photosynthesis_carbon_fix_s3.webp|450]]
- Most triose phosphate molecules are used to <span class="hi-green">regenerate the 5-C carbon dioxide acceptor</span> for the Calvin cycle to repeat.
- The regeneration process <span class="hi-green">requires ATP</span> from [[photochemical reactions]] to provide energy.
