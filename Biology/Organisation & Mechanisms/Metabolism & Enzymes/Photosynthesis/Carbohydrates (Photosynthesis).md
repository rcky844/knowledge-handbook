# Glucose
- In photosynthesis, the primary product produced is triose phosphate. It can be rapidly synthesized into glucose in leaf cells. Some of the glucose is used to release energy in [[respiration]].
- Plants also use glucose to synthesize cellulose, which makes up plant cell walls.

## Involved processes
- [[Carbon fixation#Reduction of the 3-C compound and formation of glucose]]
  Triose phosphate (3-C sugar) combine in pairs to form glucose (6-C).

# Starch
- Glucose not immediately used up in photosynthesis in leaf cells are stored as starch.
- Starch is insoluble in water and therefore does not affect the water potential of cells.

## Iodine test
An iodine test can be performed on a leaf to find out whether it contains starch. The presence of starch indicates that photosynthesis has occurred.

1. Obtain the leaf from a plant that has been exposed to bright light for several hours.
2. Put the leaf in a beaker of boiling water for about a minute to break down the cell membrane and allow the iodine solution to enter the cells later. This kills the leaf cells and stops metabolic reactions.
3. Transfer the leaf into a test tube containing alcohol, then place it in a beaker containing hot water. The alcohol <span class="hi-blue">dissolves chlorophyll</span> and allow it to diffuse out of the leaf, decolourizing the leaf.
4. Remove it from the tube and dip it in hot water for a few second to soften the leaf.
5. Spread the leaf on a white tile and add a few drops of iodine solution onto it.

*Results*:
The iodine solution changes from brown to blue-black. Starch is present in the leaf. This indicates that photosynthesis has occurred.

# Sucrose
- Starch is converted to soluble sucrose for export from leaves. It is transported by phloem to various parts of the plant (e.g. buds, fruit, roots, underground storage organs).
- The sucrose may be broken down again into glucose for use in respiration, or converted back to starch for storage.
