# Importance of water

## As a good solvent
- As the medium in which <span class="hi-green">chemical reactions</span> involving dissolved substances take place within organisms.
- As a good <span class="hi-green">transport medium</span> for transporting nutrients, gases and metabolic wastes (e.g. [[transport system]])

## As a reactant in some metabolic reactions
- [[Condensation & Hydrolysis|Hydrolysis]]
  Breakdown of complex food molecules into simple molecules with water.
- [[Photosynthesis]]
  The use of light energy to convert water and carbon dioxide to carbohydrates (e.g. glucose) and oxygen in plants.

## Takes away heat during evaporation (as a cooling agent)
- [[Evaporation of sweat]]
  Takes away heat from the skin and helps cool the body.
- [[Transpiration]]
  Prevents plants from overheating.

## As a temperature buffer
Water <u>can absorb a large amount of heat</u> (~$\pu{4.2 J g-1}$) for its temperature to rise by 1Â°C.
- Organisms contain a large proportion of water. This helps to <span class="hi-green">maintain a fairly stable body temperature</span>.
- Temperature of large bodies of water remains relatively stable. This provides a <span class="hi-green">favourable habitat for aquatic organisms</span>.

## Provides support to organisms / Aids movement
Water is <span class="hi-blue">incompressible</span>.
- [[Hydrostatic skeleton]]
  Support and allow movement in animals with <u>body cavities filled with fluid</u>. (e.g. earthworm, jellyfish)
- [[Support in plants#Turgidity of thin-walled cells|Turgidity]]
  Plant cells become turgid when they contain sufficient water. This <u>provides support to young seedlings and non-woody plants</u>.
- [[Buoyancy]]
  For aquatic organisms.
- [[Lubrication]]
  <u>Reduce friction</u> between bones during movement.
