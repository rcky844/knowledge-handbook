- **Components**: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sometimes sulphur
- **Basic units**: <span class="hi-blue">amino acids</span>

![[protein_folding.webp|300]]
- Varying sequences and length of dipeptides and polypeptides are formed when amino acids join together by [[Condensation & Hydrolysis|condensation]].
- The <u>different sequences</u> give rise to protein molecules with <u>different shapes (conformation)</u> to serve different functions.

# Functions & examples
- **Component of cellular structures**:
	- Proteins are important for the growth and repair of body tissues.
	  (e.g. cytoplasm, cell membrane, etc.)
- **Formation of some important molecules**:
	- *Haemoglobin*: Involved in the transport of oxygen in blood
	- *Enzymes*: Speed up chemical reactions in cells
	- *Antibodies*: Help protect our body against diseases
	- *Hormones*: Involved in regulating metabolic processes in the body
- **Source of energy**: Used when the human body is short of carbohydrates and lipids
