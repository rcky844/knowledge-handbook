**Minerals** in organisms occur as inorganic ions dissolved in [[cytoplasm]] and body fluids. They are essential for regulating [[metabolism]], but only needed in small amounts, as too much of it may affect water potential or disrupt neural signalling.

# Nitrates ($\ce{NO3-}$)
- For making [[proteins]], [[nucleic acids]] and [[chlorophyll]].

# Magnesium ($\ce{Mg^2+}$)
- For making [[chlorophyll]] in plants.
- A minor <u>component of bones and teeth</u>.

# Calcium ($\ce{Ca^2+}$)
- For <u>muscle contractions and blood clotting</u>.
- A major <u>component of bones, teeth and shells</u>.

# Iron ($\ce{Fe^3+}$)
- For making [[chlorophyll]] in plants.
- For making <span class="hi-blue">haemoglobin</span> in [[red blood cells]].

# Phosphorous / Phosphate ($\ce{PO4^3-}$)
- For making [[nucleic acids]], [[cell membrane]] and ATP.

# Potassium ($\ce{K+}$)
- Important for nerve impulse transmission and muscle contractions.

# Sodium ($\ce{Na+}$)
- Important for maintaining water balance and nerve impulse transmission.

# Chloride ($\ce{Cl-}$)
- Important for maintaining water balance and nerve impulse transmission.
- For making <span class="hi-blue">hydrochloric acid in gastric juice</span>.
