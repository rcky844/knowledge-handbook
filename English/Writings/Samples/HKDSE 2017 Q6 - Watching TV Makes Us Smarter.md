# Sample 1
Adjudicators, the opponent team, ladies and gentlemen,
1. **Introduction**
    - *Describe the situation and -ve stance*:
      Good morning. Today’s motion is “Watching TV Makes Us Smarter”. Speaking of watching TV, I believe some of you may have this picture in your mind – a lazy and obese guy lying on a sofa, gobbling potato chips and gluing his eyes to the flashy screen of a television set in a dark room.
    - *State your stance clearly*:
      Although over-indulgence in the world of television can deal a great blow to our lives, our team strongly believe that there are numerous benefits of watching television that can make us smarter.
2. **Knowledge of the world**
    - *Topic sentence*:
      First and foremost, watching television can widen our horizons and act as a platform for us to take a glance at the world beyond our reach.
    - *Background*:
      Especially for teenagers nowadays, who confine themselves inside the curriculum to excel in the exams under this grade-fixated education system, television programmes can be a window for them to know more about the real world and acquire knowledge that is beyond the scope of their studies.
    - *Explain the idea clearly + Point of conclusion*:
      For example, documentaries like “A Man in the Wild”, “A Walk in Modern China” and “The European Heights” feature landscapes of various continents and unveil the authentic lives of natives and locals in different territories beyond our footsteps. Can you learn these from study and work? Probably not. Therefore, apart from enjoying leisure and entertainment from TV shows, we can also obtain insight of other aspects of life and widen our horizons. These help us get a glimpse of the outside world and enrich our knowledge and understanding of the world, making us smarter instead of being bookworms that only memorize the study materials for our exams.
3. **Understanding of social issues**
    - *Topic sentence*:
      In addition to broadening our horizons, watching TV can enhance our understanding of social issues, developing critical thinking skills in the course of scrutinizing controversies through TV programmes.
    - *Background*:
      Nowadays, thanks to the advancement of information technology, we can keep abreast of the latest news through websites like Apple Daily, Mingpao, Time Magazine and Facebook. However, as we glance through the brief descriptions of news headlines and we scroll down the page on our dearest iPhones, do we truly understand the topic in detail? Obviously not.
    - *Explain the idea clearly*:
      In contrast, news reports on TV, or documentaries like “The Sunday Profile” offer an in-depth analysis of social issues, be it the widening wealth gap in Hong Kong, the “One Belt One Road Initiative” of China or the refugee crisis in Europe. In the shows, TV reporters interview political experts and stakeholders of the issue to discuss the controversial social problems. Through watching these TV programmes, we can develop our sense to think from multiple perspectives and criticize the maladministration of the government. Convenient as it is, the critical skills can hardly be cultivated by a cursory look on the electronic gadget on our palms.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      In this sense, watching TV is advantageous to honing our critical thinking, enabling us to develop a deeper understanding of our society, and of course, making us smarter.
4. **Enhance English proficiency**
    - *Topic sentence*:
      Last but not least, watching TV can enhance our English proficiency, which is vitally important in interpersonal communication.
    - *Background*:
      In Hong Kong, which is dubbed as a “cultural melting pot”, English is indispensable in our daily life, like workplace communication and socialization with foreigners.
    - *Explain the idea clearly*:
      Television, which offers English channels, helps us beef up our English listening and speaking skills. Watching financial news every day, for example, can enhance our English vocabulary of various issues, ranging from the governance of enterprises to the economic development in different countries. Watching American soap dramas on Pearl and HMC can also enrich our English vocabulary as we can learn the slangs and words used by foreigners in their scripts. As a consequence, we can communicate effectively with foreigners.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      In this sense, watching TV shows can develop our language ability, which is beneficial to us and makes us smarter.
5. **Rebuttal**
    - *State other’s stance*:
      The opponent may counter my stance, contending that indulging in soap dramas that teach us nothing but romance and family conflicts is not beneficial and makes us ignorant, since we may become obsessed with the virtual world in the TV series and forget about our real lives.
    - *Point of rebuttal*:
      However, the argument is in fact flawed.
    - *Explain the idea clearly*:
      Obviously, over-indulgence in TV can pose serious drawbacks to our well-being and mindset. However, if we utilize the television channels properly, choosing the educational programmes and channels to watch, TV in reality can make us smarter. In addition, with the prevalence of discussion of television programmes on various online forums, like Hkdiscuss and Lihkg, we can understand more about the benefits and drawbacks of a programme and make an appropriate choice. It is also worth noting that some detective story series such as Sherlock Holmes and Kindaichi Case Files are beneficial, stimulating our creative and logical thinking.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      Under this link of thinking, watching TV can make us smarter as long as we exercise self-restraint and choose the appropriate programmes.
6. **Conclusion**
    - *Summary*:
      In conclusion, TV programmes can broaden our horizons by allowing us to get a glimpse of the outside world, hone our critical thinking skills by analysing social issues and enhance our English proficiency.
    - *Restate your stance*:
      It is our firm belief that watching TV makes us smarter, and today’s motion must stand. Thank you.
