**<u>Learning English through Debating</u>**
It has recently been reported that some parents in Asian countries are installing apps on their children’s mobile phones that monitor their activities to ensure that they use these devices responsibly.

Write a letter to the Young Post stating whether you agree with these parents’ actions or not. Justify your position with three reasons.

Dear Editor,

1. **Introduction**
	- **Reason of writing:**
	  I am writing to express my opinion about some parents’ installation of monitoring apps on their children’s mobile phones.
	- **Background:**
	  “Tiger moms”, “wolf dads”, “helicopter parents” – to name but just a few – these are all terms describing Asian parents who make every endeavour to monitor or control the behaviour of their children. Recently, it has been reported that some parents in Asian countries are installing apps on their children’s mobile phones that monitor their activities to ensure their responsible use of these devices. While some deem it reasonable and sensible, some see it unreasonable and absurd.
	- **State your stance clearly:**
	  After meticulous consideration, it is my conviction that such an act is by no means beneficial to the children and the family.
2. **Children’s development of self-discipline**
    - **Topic sentence:**
      To commence with, the installation of monitoring apps will hamper children’s development of self-discipline.
    - **Explain the idea clearly:**
      Living in this technological era, it is public knowledge that self-discipline is of crucial significance for there are much more temptations in society than before. Knowing how to distinguish between right and wrong is thereby indispensable, especially for easily swayed young minds. Admittedly, through installing the apps and paying heed to every act of teens on their electronic gadgets can parents produce a deterrent effect in the short term, protecting them from falling victim to online frauds or having minds perverted by inappropriate content. Yet, such effects are by no means sustainable. Youngsters behave themselves only to avoid punishment from parents, rather than understanding the importance of using devices responsibly.
    - **Point of conclusion:**
      Consequently, many of them will fail to avoid temptations in real life, where parents can no longer monitor them.
3. **Relationship between parents and children**
    - **Topic sentence:**
      Apart from impeding children’s development of self-discipline, under no circumstances should we overlook the negative impact of installing monitoring apps poses to the relationship between parents and children.
    - **Explain the idea clearly:**
      Due to long working hours, many parents lack time to communicate with their children, thus having distant relationship with the latter. Further to this, under the influence of traditional Chinese parenting as well as the grade-fixated education system in Asian countries, many parents tend to lay emphasis on children’s academic achievement rather than expressing their love and care when they are with their children after work. As a result, misunderstanding and conflicts crop up more easily. In light of this, the act of installing apps to monitor children’s use of electronic devices will exacerbate the current problems. Teenagers, who already hardly feel the love of their parents, will deem such an act a lack of trust. They may then be more unwilling to open up to their parents, or even intentionally act against their parents’ will to express their discontent, doing irreparable harm to their relationship with parents.
    - **Point of conclusion:**
      Under this line of thinking, isn’t it farcical to install monitoring apps given it may wreak havoc on the most precious parent-child relationship?
4. **Rebuttal**
    - **State other’s stance:**
      Supporters of the act may counter my stance, holding the view that it can ensure children use their phones properly, lowering their chance of being submerged in the virtual world and thus have better time management.
    - **Politely address the other’s stance + Point of rebuttal:**
      While this argument is reasonable at first glance, it is in fact fundamentally flawed when closely examined. Undeniably, such an act can prevent children from getting addicted to the use of mobile phones in the beginning. However, does it necessarily mean that children will allocate their time to studies or other meaningful use? With children’s immature mind, they may be obsessed with playing online games and browsing the Internet on computers; With children’s immature mind, they may still be hooked on watching television programmes; With children’s immature mind, they may be vulnerable to the distractions and temptations in the real world.
    - **Point of conclusion:**
      In other words, it is simply difficult, if not impossible, to control teenagers’ responsible use of time.
5. Conclusion
    - **Restate your stance + Summary:**
      After the aforementioned analysis, it is manifest that the parents’ installation of monitoring apps on their children’s phones is in no way reasonable. We have to understand that this will deter children from developing self-discipline and shatter the mutual trust between parents and children while having minimal impact on controlling children’s use of time.
    - **End in high spirits (What Asian parents should do):**
      Thus, it is earnestly hoped that Asian parents can stop this futile act in no time. After all, parental education is about love and care, rather than rules and supervision.

Yours faithfully,
Chris Wong
