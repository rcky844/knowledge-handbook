Unlike swimmers or basketball players, dancers are not traditionally thought of as athletes. As a member of your school’s dance team you have been asked to write an article for your school magazine. Use the title and headings below to support the idea of dancers as athletes.

<p style="text-align: center;">Dancers Are Athletes</p>

- Physical Strength and Skills
- Self-discipline & Training

1. **Introduction**
    - **Background:**
      What comes up in your mind when you are asked to give examples of athletes? Swimmers, basketball players, 100 m sprint runners ... You name it. Sadly, the general public seldom regard dancers as a kind of athletes due to the existence of some stereotypes.
    - **State your stance clearly:**
      In fact, dancers are real athletes, and like others, they need to be skillful and disciplined enough in order to excel in the world of dancing.
2. **Physical Strengths and Skills**
    - **Topic sentence:**
      We need to bear in mind that physical strengths and skills are the prerequisites for phenomenal success in both ordinary athletic sports and dancing.
    - **Background:**
      Athletic sports are often seen as some kinds of sports requiring high physical strengths and are skill-oriented, like gymnastics, in which body balance and the skills to achieve elegant movements are of paramount of significance; and 1500m run, which requires strong muscles and an excellent cardiovascular system.
    - **Explain the idea clearly:**
      Similarly, a dancer has to fulfill similar requirements. For instance, hip-hop dancers are encouraged to have sharp and rapid movements that require the use of strong muscle movements and the frequent steps in hip hop dance also demand the dancers to have a trained respiratory system which can support strenuous movements and endure for a long period of time. This proves dancing actually needs dancers to have a certain level of physical strength, like other athletic sports. In terms of the skills involved, I believe dancing has far more techniques that need to be developed by the dancers themselves than those who are traditionally regarded as athletes. Dancing techniques, ranging from movements and steps to teamwork and choreography, should be figured out by the dancers step by step before they become professional dancers.
    - **Point of conclusion:**
      It is evident that dancers are just like the athletes on the stage of the Olympics in which they have to spare no effort in developing their own sets of skills.
3. **Self-discipline & Training**
    - **Different stances:**
      Some argue that dancers are not receiving as much training as the athletes on tracks, in the basketball courts or even on the ice-skating rings.
    - **Point of rebuttal:**
      It is high time for dancers to defend themselves against the skeptical naysayers who doubt whether dancers are athletes.
    - **Explain the idea clearly:**
      We can often see that dancers shine on the stage of the town hall, presenting their brilliant dances to the audience, and all these can be attributed to their ceaseless training behind the scene. Like the other athletes, it is almost compulsory for every dancer to receive a series of incessant training before they head onto the stage. You also have to remember they are reprimanded by their instructors almost on a daily basis like the athletes on track, just to hone everything to perfection. We often hear the stories of athletes suffering great emotional meltdown during their training, so do the dancers! It is apparent that the endurance of dancers will be no weaker than those who have been recognized as athletes. Besides, we can all realize that self-discipline is indispensable for all athletes. As a dancer in the school’s dance team, I truly understand that self-discipline is also crucial in the road of mastering dancing, and this is the perfect evidence that dancers are also athletes. No matter it is a professional dancer like Liu Man Ting, who aces in ballet, Yanki Din who aces in Jazz, and hip hop, or an amateur dancer like me, they have to arrange packed schedules for themselves for the sake of grabbing more chances for practising and performing in flawless shows.
    - **Point of conclusion:**
      Being as self-disciplined and motivated as other athletes, they should be recognized true athletes.
4. **Conclusion**
    - **Summary + Restate your stance:**
      To sum up, dancers are not thought of as athletes merely due to the public misunderstanding and stereotypes. Nevertheless, I do believe dancers are true athletes, as they have worked their butts off to transform themselves into skillful and persistent warriors like the other athletes do.
