# Letter to the Editor: Space oil
Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my concern regarding the alarming rise of vaping among teenagers in Hong Kong, particularly the use of "space oil", which is often disguised as e-cigarette capsules. This dangerous trend has been highlighted in recent headlines, with juveniles arrested for possessing and selling these drugs. Such incidents underscore the urgent need for action. The rise in vaping among our youth is fuelled by insufficient awareness of the risks associated with these substances and the natural curiosity of young people. To examine the issue and raise citizens' awareness of this dangerous drug, I will first explain what attributes to the trend, followed by practical solutions to mitigate the severity of the issue.

The major reason why teens are attracted to "space oil" is indeed the lack of awareness about its dangers. Many teenagers do not realize that "space oil" contains harmful drugs like etomidate, an anesthetic that is illegal to possess without a prescription. This ignorance can lead to experimentation, putting their health at significant risk. A recent survey of the Youth Council reveals that most teenagers have not heard about the potential health risks of space oil, and drug takers have attempted the drug due to curiosity. While it is crucial that we address this gap in understanding before it leads to more severe consequences, we should be aware of the low awareness of drugs among teenagers.

To combat this issue, I propose two key solutions to both schools and government. First, the government, as the leader of society, should step up efforts to launch a comprehensive anti-vaping campaign in schools. This initiative could involve peer ambassadors who educate their classmates about the dangers of vaping and encourage them to report any drug use. It is suggested that an insightful talk held by experts on drugs should be organized. With this talk, students can gain an insight into the fact that taking space oil is synonymous with taking drugs. After raising their awareness, there should be activities such as game booths for students to know the health risks of space oil. By empowering students to take an active role in their health education, we can foster a culture of awareness and responsibility.

Second, the government should leverage social media platforms, especially Instagram, where adolescents are most active, to disseminate information about the risks of vaping and drug use. It is revealed by many companies that using social media platform such as Instagram can effectively raise teenagers' awareness on the topic that they are advertising. The government can invite idols such as Keung To do endorse the idea that space oil is detrimental to health. Engaging advertisements that resonate with young people can effectively capture their attention and inform them about the dangers of substances like "space oil".

By implementing these solutions, we can help prevent our youth from the dangers of vaping and drug use. It is vital that we act now to ensure a healthier future for our teenagers. As teenagers are future pillars of society, both the government and schools should make collaborative efforts in combating the severe trend that may put thousands of innocent teenagers into jeopardy.

Yours faithfully,
Chris Wong
