Unveiling the magical town of Japan

Greetings! "Konnichiwa" the Japanese word for "hello". After my previous blog to Europe, many readers have asked me to explore Japan. With the suggestions from a lot of avid travellers, especially the one from Blogger "Ming Jai", I snatched a ticket to Tokyo amid this peak travel season. Fellow adventurers! Get ready to embark on an epic journey through the wondrous world of Japan with me! From ancient customs to mind-boggling technology, this country is a captivating blend of tradition and innovation. Buckle up and let's dive into the beauty, history, and cutting-edge wonders that await us!

As I arrived (at) Kansai airport, the city's electrifying energy swept me off my feet. Hopping onto the famous JR train, I felt like I as walking into the Instagram reels introducing Japan. Excitement filled the air and I was so ready to set foot on this cool town! Guess where I'm heading to - check out my JR ticket, it's a special edition in December! You are right! We will be en route to Tokyo.

"Ding... Ding..." The catchy and iconic tune of Shinjuku station filled my heart with joy. I explored Shinjuku. Leaping out of the East exit, flashing neon lights, towering skyscrapers and plenty of shops caught my eyes. Wow! See this photo of Glico running sign that I attached here. That's truly captivating! I stopped by two incredible food spots: Ichiran Ramen and Sushi Zanmai. Ichiran was famous for its rich, tonkotsu broth and unique solo dining booths - did you know making loud slurping sounds represent your gratitude and appreciation to the chef? I gulped down the bouncy noddles with a loud noise! Also, Sushi Zanmai was a sushi lover's paradise, offering fresh, high-quality sushi at reasonable prices. I couldn't resist trying their fatty tuna, and it was divine!

After soaking in the sights of Shinjuku, I hopped on the JR train and headed over to Kyoto. The ride was smooth and scenic, and I enjoyed watching the beautiful countryside whizz by. I remember being impressed by how efficient the JR trains were; they were so punctual!

As a matcha lover, I was like a kid in a candy store about what Kyoto had to offer. Once I arrived, I sought out a traditional tea house to indulge in some matcha. "Hmm", so delicious! Comment down below for a chance to win a deluxe can of matcha powder that I bought. I stumbled upon a cozy little sport where I experience a matcha tea ceremony. The ritual of preparing and serving matcha was mesmerizing. I loved watching the tea master whisk the vibrant green powder into a frothy drink, and the taste was nothing short of heavenly - rich, earthly, and full of flavor. I even tried matcha-flavored sweets, like soft matcha mochi and creamy matcha ice cream, which were delightful. Kyoto truly felt like a matcha paradise!

Like my other blogs, I relish reflecting on my experiences. Travelling through Osaka and Kyoto reminded me of the importance of immersing myself in different cultures. From the bustling streets to the serene temples, each experience deepened my understanding of Japan's rich history and traditions. Unlike other bloggers who only talk about shopping. I felt a genuine connection to the people and places I encountered.

This trip also inspired me to learn a language. I promised myself to work toward my N5 journey. It's not just about language but about goal setting and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. Every step I take brings me closer to fully embracing the culture and making the most of my travels. This mesmerizing trip reminded me of my favourate Japanese anime "Naruta". One of the famous quotes says, "If you don't like your destiny, don't accept it. Instead, have the courage to change it the way you want to be!"

So there you have it - my adventures in Osaka and a quick jaunt to Kyoto were a match made in travel heaven. Whether I was exploring the lively streets of Shinjuku or enjoying a leisurely train ride to Kyoto, I had a blast. If you've been to Osaka, what were your favorite sports? Or if you've (been) planning a trip, what are you most excited to see? I'd love to hear your thoughts!
