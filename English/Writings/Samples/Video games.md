Good morning students. A heated topic of our schoolmates is Genshin Impact, and every one is obsessed with the game. Do you ever find yourself feeling tired or unfocused during your lessons? Maybe your eyes feel strained, or you have a hard time concentrating? One of the main culprits could be spending too much time playing video games first thing in the morning. Being an avid player in the past, I used to game heavily until my academic results go (went) terribly wrong and my vision become blurry all the time. As someone who has been through the disaster of video game obsession, I would like to *share my two cents* on why you should not be addicted to video games.

Do you know the biggest consequence of endless video-gaming? That is definitely the toll on physical health. When you wake up and immediately start gaming, it puts a lot of strain on your eyes and brain. Research has shown that the screen will severely impair your vision, leading to early diagnosis of cataract. Worse still, the blue light from screens can disrupt your natural sleep-wake cycle, and intense gaming sessions can leave your feeling drained and lethargic rather than energized for the day. Not only will excessive gaming harm your vision, it will also dread your energetic soul.

In addition, it is detrimental to your academic result. When you're distracted and fatigued from excessive gaming, it becomes much harder to focus and engage during your lessons. You may find yourself struggling to follow along with the material, or having a hard time retaining the information presented. This can lead to lower test scores, worse overall academic performance, and a general lack of progress in your education. Our student council's survey shows that the majority of students who game heavily in the mornings tend to have less satisfactory academic performance compared to their peers. It's a clear sign that there is an imbalance happening - too much time spent on entertainment and not enough on the studies that should be your top priority.

Instead of jumping straight into video games, I encourage you all to try a different routine of staying unplugged. Maybe take 30 minutes to go for a quick walk, have a healthy breakfast, or read a book. Engaging in calming, low-screen activities in the morning can help you feel more alert and ready to learn when you get to your classrooms. I have tried that myself. After engaging in off-screen 10-min work a day, I become so much more positive, sharp-witted and even charming! Let's embark on this journey together, to revive our spirit, not to dampen it!

I know video games are fun and it can be tempting to get in some gaming time before school. But trust me, your mind and body will thank you if you limit that screen time in the mornings. You'll find you have more energy, better focus, and are able to get much more out of your lessons. So let's all make a pledge to be more mindful of our morning habits. Put down the controllers, close the laptops, and give your eyes and brain a break. I guarantee you'll see a difference in how you feel and perform at school. Thank you, and have a wonderful rest of your day!
