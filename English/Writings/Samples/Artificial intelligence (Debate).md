# Debate: beneficial or detrimental
Ladies and gentlemen, all our digital citizens. Let's confess - <span class="hi-green">Has anyone here not utilized the powerful tool called ChatGPT before?</span> Shook your head if you have never used this wonderful invention at all. Even our opponents today may have used AI to assist them writing the script. With its remarkable capabilities to work for humans instantly, we can't deny the fact that no one, including you and me, could be free from the hands of ChatGPT. Thus, our team line today is <span class="hi-blue">"Let's grow with ChatGPT"</span>, and our team are convinced that ChatGPT should be allowed in school.

The most significant rationale behind our belief is that this advanced learning platform <span class="hi-blue">boosts learning efficiency</span> With the assistance of ChatGPT, students can <span class="hi-blue">access a vast amount of information and resources in a flash</span>. Imagine you are struggling with a History essay about the consequences of World War II. With just a click, a well-written and informative piece of work can be *churned out effortlessly*. A recent survey conducted by a local youth organization that local students' stress mainly stems from the excessive amount of time on completing homework. Reducing time for homework has indeed <span class="hi-green">allowed more entertainment and relaxation for teens</span>, which also <span class="hi-green">alleviate the problem of academic stress</span> among our students in distress.

Apart from the *efficacy* provided by this innovative friend, it also vastly <span class="hi-blue">enhances the quality of learning</span>. The interactive nature of ChatGPT allows students to <span class="hi-green">engage in meaningful conversations and ask questions, leading to a deeper understanding of the subject matter</span>. Who can deny the fact that ChatGPT just resembles a virtual teacher, who provide round-the-clock assistance to helpless learners? According to a survey launched by school(s), a majority of students admitted that ChatGPT has helped them grasp the textbook knowledge better as the tool provides personalized help to students with a specific question. Undeniably, <span class="hi-blue">students can grow and thrive with this amazing virtual teacher</span>.

Our dear opponents may *contend* that students could become <span class="hi-green">overly reliant on the technology, potentially hindering their independent and critical thinking skills</span>. To address this concern, it is important to emphasize that ChatGPT <span class="hi-blue">should not replace traditional learning methods but rather complement</span> them. It can serve as a valuable tool in a student's academic journey, providing additional support and guidance. Even top *tertiary* institution like <u>HKU has allowed the use of ChatGPT in exams</u>, acknowledging the necessity of using e-learning tool. They have adapted the assessment, such as carrying out oral discussion and changing question formats to allow critical thinking process(es) in exam. <span class="hi-green">By encouraging students to engage critically with the information provided by ChatGPT, we can foster a healthy balance between utilizing technology and nurturing independent thinking skills.</span>

Some scholars oppose the use of ChatGPT as they believe <u>it may stifle learners' creativity and undermine their critical thinking skills</u>. However, whether a *double-edged sword* becomes harmful depends on how we use it. If we can harness the power of an advanced learning tool to facilitate learning, it could instead encourage <span class="hi-blue">higher-order thinking</span>. It parallels the advent of the Internet, which, like ChatGPT, <span class="hi-green">can have both positive and negative effects on learning depending on its application</span>. Top tertiary institution like the University of Hong Kong has positioned itself at the forefront of (the) digital era by allowing free access to generative AI, ChatGPT, even in examinations. While students are taught how to enhance their understanding of knowledge with the instant answering machine, they are also tested in different methods such as oral discussions and project-based assessments. The adaptation has guaranteed that learners can have a good grasp of subject matter while not being too reliant on the innovative technology.

As our team line "Let's grow with ChatGPT" suggests, this powerful learning tool is <span class="hi-green">indispensable to learners' lives in this digital and ever-changing era</span>. Our team strongly believes that by integrating ChatGPT into homework and assignments, we can create a more interactive and engaging learning environment, empowering students to explore subjects in greater depth and acquire valuable skills for the future. It is undeniable that technology is rapidly advancing, and as educators, <span class="hi-green">it is our responsibility to adapt and harness its potential for the benefit of our students</span>. As my explanations have come to an end, I would like to propose a question to our dear opponent, "Can you provide any ways that are more efficient than using ChatGPT to learn?" Thank you everyone and today *the motion must stand*.
