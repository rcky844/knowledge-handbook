# Letter to the Editor
Dear Editor,

Having read the recent JPEX scandals, as a technician, I am concerned about the rise of scams in Hong Kong. Pressing as it is, recent statistics by the Hong Kong Police Force indicate that there were nearly 20,000 reported scam cases in the first half of 2024, accounting for approximately 50% of all crimes in Hong Kong in 2024. What add fuels to this this the total financial loss from these scams, which reached a staggering HK$4.48 billion and marked a 66.5% increase from the previous year. In light of this alarming trend, I am writing to exemplify the underlying cause and shed light on the plausible solutions.

A primary reason for the prevalence of scams is low public awareness towards fraud tactics. Many individuals, particularly younger populations and senior citizens, may not fully understand and recognize scams. Not only do the scammers pose as deliveryman from SF express, but they also disguise as immigration officers of staff from Bank of China. The aftermath is that victims are often misled into providing personal information, ranging from credit card numbers to bank account passwords. It was already too late when the victims realised they were scammed. The problem is further exacerbated by the sophistication of modern scams, which can be highly convincing and tailored to exploit the trust and naivety of unsuspecting victims. Without the scepticism towards scams, no wonder why many prudent Hongkongers have become gullible and have fallen victim to scams nowadays.

Apart from citizens not being vigilant against scam, advanced and sophisticated technology is attributed to the alarming rise of scams. The advancement of artificial intelligence and deepfake technology has enabled fraudsters to craft remarkably convincing impersonations of government officials and celebrities to deceive the vulnerable public. Among the 16183 cases of technology-related crimes, one prominent incident saw a multinational firm employee duped during a video conference, leading to a staggering HK$200 million loss due to the spread of company's confidential information. Senior citizens, who are not proficient in technology, are particularly susceptible to those technology-induced scams. As scammers leverage these advanced tools deceive victims, the challenge of combating technology-driven fraud becomes increasingly daunting.

The lack of awareness and vigilance can be attributed to insufficient educational initiatives targeting vulnerable groups, particularly teenagers and young adults who are more likely to engage with digital platforms where these scams are prevalent. Without proper guidance and awareness campaigns, these individuals may not possess the know-how to identify and avoid such deceptive practices. To combat this issue effectively, two solutions can be implemented.

To begin with, education targeting teens should be launched immediately. To do so, educational institutions should integrate comprehensive anti-scam education into their curricula. One effective approach for students to identify scams would be to invite professionals from relevant fields to deliver workshops and seminars. While police officers could share real-life case studies of scams and highlight the tactics used by fraudsters and the devastating impacts experience by victims, financial experts, meanwhile, could guide safe online banking practices, spotting phishing attempts, and securing personal information. These educational sessions could also incorporate role-playing exercises, such as launching drills with internal emails, where students actively participate in scenarios simulating scam attempts. By immersing themselves in these interactive activities, students can develop a better understanding of scams and potential responses to deter scams. This hands-on approach can instil a sense of vigilance among the younger generation, making them less susceptible to fraud.

Besides, anti-scam campaigns should be organized. Initiatives like the mascot "The Little Grape" can serve as an effective model for broader anti-scam efforts. This campaign specifically targets young people using engaging content that resonates with their experiences and concerns. The campaign could utilize social media platforms popular among teens to disseminate information about common scams and how to avoid them. Additionally, collaboration with local businesses to create promotional materials - such as posters or videos - can enhance visibility and reach within communities. The Hong Kong Police Force's "Anti-Scam Month" campaign is another example where targeted outreach efforts are made through various channels to raise awareness about scam tactics. Compounding these efforts, these campaigns can significantly expand the reach and impact of educational initiatives, ultimately engendering a more informed public and better equipping them to safeguard themselves against the rising tide of scams in Hong Kong.

In conclusion, addressing scams in Hong Kong requires a multifaceted approach that includes enhancing public awareness through education and targeted campaigns. By raising the awareness of the vulnerable groups, we can significantly reduce the incidence of scams and protect our community from financial harm. It is crucial that we act now, not later, to equip both junior and senior members of society with the knowledge they need to safeguard themselves against these deceptive practices.

Yours faithfully,
Chris Wong
