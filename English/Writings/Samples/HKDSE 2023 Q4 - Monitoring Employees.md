<p style="text-align: center;">Monitoring Employees——Is It a Wise Move?</p>

Whether to always keep an eye on employees’ behaviours in the workplace or to allow them to have more freedom has always been highly debated among employers. Different firms implement diverse approaches for employee management, some turn out to be a way to success while others have brought irreversible consequences. It would be a wise thing to do that we scrutinize the approach in question before adopting it — should we monitor employees?

There are, indeed, some benefits of doing so. Topping the list of monitoring staff would be increased productivity. It is crystal clear that one’s productivity solely hinges on one’s self-discipline. Nonetheless, this fundamental ability varies as different individuals’ personalities, characteristics or even values are diverse. Companies simply have no control over whether an employee has self-discipline. This is when monitoring helps. It is not uncommon for some employees to deal with their private matters during working hours in the workplace, namely browsing social media platforms or going for a chat with colleagues. However, if computer software is installed on employees’ devices, access to those websites would be denied automatically, leaving employees no other options but to work. The camera works as a reminder to employees that all their behaviours are being tracked during working hours, so they would refrain from having excessive and unnecessary chats with colleagues. Therefore, it is conceivable that monitoring employees would boost productivity.

Another prominent but often overlooked benefit of monitoring is that it ensures the safety of both employees and the firm. Ridiculous as it may seem, a workplace without surveillance cameras, is the best location for unlawful activities to take place. According to the Annual Workplace Crimes Report from the Police Department of Hong Kong, 89% of workplace crimes, like stealing personal property, took place within the workplace without cameras. When there is the possibility for employees’ personal property to be stolen, so do the documents that must be kept secret. No business can deal with the damage done by a breach of confidentiality easily. If every corner of the firm is being rigorously monitored by cameras, It is not impossible for the safety of employees and the company to be guaranteed. Who doesn’t want to work in an environment that is safe? The policy of setting up monitoring cameras is, therefore, an effective way to encourage employee job satisfaction.

However, coins have two sides. Having discussed the pros of monitoring, we should also
draw attention to the negative side, which is discussed, as follows.

Monitoring employees as a means to improve productivity may, frankly, turn out to be counterproductive and is likely to backfire in certain companies. This issue particularly applies to companies whose business is highly dependent on creativity, like designer companies and entertainment firms which produce videos for social media platforms. Now, it is an era in which the TikTok economy thrives. Many companies hire crews to produce short videos and yield high amounts of revenue. However, the key for TikTok Economy to work is creativity, which is stifled if a person is being monitored. According to a psychological theorem, when a person is doing what they really enjoy, then they are in “the flow”, which means they will feel time flies by quickly. However, if the person is feeling to be forced into doing something, then they will struggle to produce anything usable. The same happens in those firms: if the employees are being closely watched, then they will inevitably feel forced to work, hence producing nothing helpful for the company. In such cases, bankruptcy is the only possible destination for the company. To conclude, for certain industries, monitoring employees may turn out to be counterproductive.

The pros and cons of monitoring employees in the workplace are listed and scrutinized above. The question of whether employers should impose such policies, however, cannot be answered by simply listing out the advantages and disadvantages as multiple factors are inextricably interwoven. It is hoped that employees and employers can have a rational and effective communication to reach an agreement on the method of striking a balance between the company’s interests and employees’ privacy.
