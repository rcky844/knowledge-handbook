# Sample 1
1. **Introduction**
    - *Background*:
      Even if we are not the keen followers of social trends, it is unlikely we will miss out the rising trend of online public debate. Scrolling through the pages of YouTube and Facebook, we are bound to discover that there is no dearth of public debate on a variety of topics. The advancement in social media has irrefutably incentivized discussion about social affairs. Some may understandably scratch their heads: aren’t these kinds of debate too irrational? Aren’t social media platforms stifling public debate due to excessively high degree of freedom of expression?
    - *State your stance clearly*:
      Indeed, these are no more than misunderstanding of social media platforms. Below are the reasons why social media encourages online discussion.
2. **Social media has become the fertile ground of public debate.**
    - *Topic sentence*:
      While the debates on social media platforms seem to be fierce and deleterious, there are actually many benefits hidden from plain sight, which negate the so-called downsides. Firstly, it is worth noting that the willingness of expressing opinion in the virtual world coincides with the blossoming of social media.
    - *Explain the barriers of face-to-face communication*:
      Chatting face-to-face, many people are reluctant to speak out for fear that they may be criticized, offend others and ultimately damage interpersonal relationships.
    - *Explain the benefits of social media*:
      In contrast, with only a few tabs on the screen, netizens can already express their view on various social issues. Undoubtedly, social media has played a significant role in fuelling the trend of public debate. Owing to the anonymous nature of online platforms, people can voice their opinion without constraints and fear, wholeheartedly telling others their thoughts. Without the supervision by teachers, students can criticize the ossified education system on the Internet; without the watchful eyes by their parents, teenagers can vent their dissatisfaction with helicopter parenting; without being lambasted by colleagues of contrasting political view, everyone can fearlessly express their exasperation with the incompetence of the government.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      Motivating people to voice their opinion, social media has become the fertile ground of public debate.
3. **Social media has offered a wider variety of communication tools.**
    - *Topic sentence*:
      Apart from emboldening netizens to express their view, the fact that they can utilize a wide variety of communication tools has also encouraged people to participate in public debate.
    - *Background*:
      Gone are the days when we could only initiate a debate solely through words, which were repetitive and tedious. Thanks to technological advancement, we can type words, take snapshots and even record videos to express our view of various issues.
    - *Explain the point clearly*:
      Apparently, the availability of photos and videos has added spice and spark to the virtual world, motivating more young people to engage in online discussion. More importantly, through posting photos and videos can netizens provide more compelling evidence and lay a solid foundation for online debate. For example, when an online user vents his or her frustration with a passenger’s reluctance to vacate a seat for a pregnant woman on an MTR train or a deluxe restaurant’s deplorably atrocious customer services merely through words, most people would deem this a make-up story and malicious condemnation. However, if snapshots and videos are provided, most netizens will be convinced and opt to support that online user’s arguments.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      As we can see, not only can the kaleidoscope of communicative tools available on social media appeal to netizens, but also strengthen the persuasive power of online debate.
4. **Social media discussion can encourage public debate by enhancing its quality.**
    - *Different stances*:
      Blinded by their bias against social media platforms, some conservatives hold the belief that social media stifles public debate by making discussion excessively ferocious and irrational.
    - *Point of rebuttal*:
      Nevertheless, we should recognize the fact that the capacity of the virtual world enables millions of netizens to comment on the same issue, thereby raising the objectiveness of public debate.
    - *Explain the idea clearly*:
      Differing from a face-to-face debate which only allows a limited number of participants, social media discussion can be engaged in by netizens from all walks of life and all over the globe. Having a discussion commenced, like Brexit, the Sino-US trade war and the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, online users of different careers, ages and nationalities could have a say. With people thinking from different perspectives by reading and responding to different comments, there is no doubt the debate will be more comprehensive and its quality will be enhanced. While some staunch opponents distance themselves from social media, demonizing it as a destroyer of logical debate, we should bear in mind that once there are unreasonably radical comments on the social media platforms, they will be instantly challenged by other sensible netizens, some of whom are erudite professionals like lawyers, scholars and political analysts.
    - *Conclusion*:
      With this in mind, it can be clearly seen that the participation in social media discussion from netizens all over the globe can encourage public debate through enhancing its quality and making it more objective.
5. **Conclusion**
    - *Summary*:
      In essence, social media platforms are the perfect cradle encouraging public debate. Their unique features – allowing users to be anonymous, having a wide variety of communicative tools and encouraging a surging number of global participants have all been advantageous to the discussion of social affairs.
    - *End in high spirits* (What others employees should do):
      It is earnestly hoped that everyone will recognize the benefits of social media in galvanizing public discussion, which will ultimately enhance governance and the well-being of mankind.
