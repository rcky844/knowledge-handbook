Master your own work

It has come to my attention that an increasing number of students at our school are submitting work that is not only *synonymous* in wording but also lacks originality. It is blatantly obvious a majority of junior form students submitted an almost identical and sterile work for the recent History take-home essay assignment, and our recently installed AI monitoring system has detected *plagiarism* from AI answering machine. This trend is disappointing, especially considering that out history team has implemented significant penalties for all instances of identical submission. As a history teacher who believes strongly in the values of *creativity and academic integrity*, I would like to raise students' awareness about this severe issue of using artificial intelligence to cheat and produce low-quality works.

First and foremost, relying on AI-generated content hampers students' (independent) thinking skills. The rationale behind assignments is to cultivate problem-solving, creativity, and *critical thinking* skills. Recently, during a history take-home assignment on the question, "Was the Second World War unavoidable?" we were shocked to find that over half of the students provided similar responses that *superficially* acknowledged the complexity of the question without offering a *coherent* and convincing stance. The most common answer was "the question of whether the Second World War was unavoidable is complex and debated among historians.", which appeared to be <u>directly copied from AI chatbots</u>, filled with irrelevant facts that failed to address the question. This is just the *tip of the iceberg*; similar situations have emerged across all subjects, including science and humanities. Our recent summative assessments indicate that <u>students struggle significantly with questions requiring critical thinking skills</u>, demonstrating that AI tools like ChatGPT pose a real threat to students' intellectual development - a concern I take very seriously.

Apart from *jeopardizing* <u>cognitive development</u> of students, the use of AI also contributes to the spread of misinformation. Many students have submitted responses that, while seemingly well-structured, contain *erroneous* or outdated facts. A renowned research form The University of Cambridge shows that AI suffers from limitations with mathematical questions, not to mention that a lot of research has shown that response from AI spew nonsense and biased ideas. "1.11 is a bigger token than 1.9" is a common *fallacy* of AI answering machine, while we checked that the <u>most recent social development in Hong Kong such as the ban on plastic cutlery is not even included in its database</u>. All these inaccurate information raises serious concerns about the quality of information students are consuming and even relying on.

*In light of* the severe situation, I advise that students should take ownership of their work and embrace the creative and satisfying process of working things out. While AI can serve as a helpful *complement* to your studies, developing independent thinking skills is critical to your academic success and essential for problem-solving in the future. <u>Be the master of your own marvelous work</u>. Don't forget - you are not allowed to use any electronic device in the exam. With this line of thinking, using AI when doing homework equals *chronic poisoning*. As I am sure every student's goal is to achieve remarkable results in the exam, it would be undesirable to *befriend* with a tool that is taking a *heavy toll* on your studies.

To deter students from relying on AI to complete their work, our school will be adopting an advanced <u>plagiarism checker</u> to ensure that all students' work is original. Failing to submit original work may result in failing grades for those assignments. We believe this step is essential in promoting *academic honesty and integrity*. We understand that this measure might stir up anxiety among all our students, who have been *inadvertently* using AI or a lot of work. To complement our measure, a team of *academic helpers* would be assigned to all students who confront difficulties. When students are struggling with their homework, they can simply call our school or ask a question on our e-platform. It is believed that these measures will be highly *conducive* to students' learning.

In conclusion, I urge all students to reflect on the importance of originality in their work. I am sure every student is concerned about their homework, learning process and academic result. It is *of utmost importance* to develop a more positive and *active style* of learning. Let's work together to foster a culture of creativity and integrity that will serve us well in our academic journeys and beyond. Lastly, I look forward to *splendid* and well-written work from your next history assignment about World War II!
