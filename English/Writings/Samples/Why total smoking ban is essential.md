1. **Introduction**
    - *Introducing the topic*:
      In recent years, the issue of total smoking ban has caused controversy in our society.
    - *Explaining +ve/-ve stance*:
      As for the business sector and investors, they believe that a territory-wide smoking ban in all entertainment venues is detrimental to their business. However, others think that if entertainment venues such as mahjong parlours are exempted, public health will be jeopardized.
    - *Explaining your stance*:
      In my opinion, it is urgent for the government to implement total smoking ban in Hong Kong. In the following, I will explain my arguments.
2. **Economic impact**
    - *Topic sentence*:
      To start with, we should note that the importance of health outweighs the economic impact of imposing a total ban on smoking.
    - *Explaining the situation* (general trends, data, individual examples, comparisons):
      It is apparent that smoking is harmful to our health. As we all know, smoking could result in a few nasty side-effects, such as bad skin as well as poor breath and fitness. If we are smokers, we will frequently pant after doing intense exercise. More importantly, smoking can cause lung cancer and heart disease, which lead to death. According to scientific research in recent years, second-hand smoke is even more toxic and fatal than first-hand smoke.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      Therefore, preventing smokers from killing themselves and others, including both customers and staff, is an urgent public health issue.
3. **Safety (in entertainment venues)**
    - *Topic sentence*:
      In addition, total smoking ban can improve the safety in entertainment venues.
    - *Explaining the situation* (general trends, data, individual examples, comparisons):
      In Hong Kong, it is common to find these venues in the old buildings in old districts like Sham Shui Po and Yau Ma Tei. As everyone knows, abandoned cigarettes often lead to fire. In case of a fire, smoke can spread to different areas rapidly. To make the matters worse, the evacuation routes of old buildings are sometimes blocked by rubbish. If a serious fire breaks out, customers of entertainment venues will not be able to escape from the scene and heavy casualties will result.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      Hence, it is essential for the government to adopt total smoking ban.
4. **Rebuttal**
    - *State other’s stance*:
      Despite the arguments above, many people still emphasize that territory-wide smoking ban will significantly reduce the number of customers in entertainment venues and exacerbate the unemployment problem.
    - *Politely address the other’s stance*:
      Undeniably, the ban will adversely affect the business of these venues.
    - *Point of rebuttal*:
      Nevertheless, we should remember that the health cost of smoking is tremendous.
    - *Explaining the situation* (general trends, data, individual examples, comparisons):
      According to a research done by Hong Kong University, the annual cost of treating the diseases related to smoking is over 5 billion dollars. As mentioned above, smoking is a culprit of chronic diseases like lung cancer and heart disease. Since most people in Hong Kong consume public medical services, the cost of treating smokers will pose a huge financial burden to our government.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      Considering the cost and benefits, territory-wide smoking ban should definitely be implemented for the sake of the welfare of our whole society.
5. **Conclusion**
    - *Restate your stance + Summary:*
      In conclusion, the government should implement total smoking ban as it can safeguard the health of the general public and prevent fire disasters. While it will engender short-term economic pain, the colossal long-term cost of smoking will be minimized.
    - *End in high spirits* (What the government should do):
      Therefore, the government should not hesitate anymore. It should adopt the measure as soon as possible.
