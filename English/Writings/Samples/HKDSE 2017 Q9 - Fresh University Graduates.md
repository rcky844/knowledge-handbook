Dear Editor,

# Sample 1

1. **Introduction**
    - *Reason for writing*:
      I am writing in response to the letter entitled “Fresh university graduates lack the willingness to work hard and overcome challenges” dated 7 April 2017.
    - *State your stance directly*:
      As a young entrepreneur, I am strongly against such a claim due to the following seasons.
2. **They are willing to explore new business opportunities in society.**
    - *Topic sentence*:
      In fact, fresh university graduates in Hong Kong are willing to explore new business opportunities in society, which reveals that they are not afraid of challenges.
    - *Explain the idea clearly*:
      The 21st century is a century of technological advancement and the Internet has provided the young generation with a flood of new business opportunities. Not afraid of possible failures, a lot of new university graduates in our city actually set up their own business online, ranging from online shops to online mass media. One glaring example of this new type of business is 9GAG, which is a Facebook page posting memes and jokes, and has become viral not only in Hong Kong but also in foreign countries. Their willingness to develop this brand-new type of business illustrates the fact that they are willing to face challenges, not to mention the hard work they have devoted to maintaining the operation of their own business and achieving phenomenal success.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      How would it be reasonable to call the fresh university graduates in Hong Kong “lazy” and “easily defeated by challenges” given the phenomenon mentioned above, which is becoming more common among the young generation?
3. **They spend time on social networking sites during their work hours.**
    - *Topic sentence*:
      Yet, some employers may complain that their new employees are spending their precious time on social networking sites instead of their work during their working hours.
    - *Explain the idea clearly*:
      It must be acknowledged that some the fresh university graduates are not paying full attention to their work, but the work culture in Hong Kong, instead of the young generation, is to be blamed. In myriads of foreign companies, employers are trying to incorporate entertainment into work, with Google being one of the most notable companies. My own company has already adopted similar approaches, such as installing television sets in the office, and I have never complained that my employees are not industrious enough. Unfortunately, in most of the companies in Hong Kong, employees are still required to sit front of the computer and work ceaselessly, which is boring especially for the young generation who ranks creativity and novel ideas on the top of their priority lists. Yet, such a problem can actually be tackled by the above-mentioned approach. With more entertainment in the work culture, I strongly believe that young employees will find more incentives to work and become more hardworking.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      Therefore, it can be seen that the monotonous and dreary work culture in Hong Kong is the culprit of the problems and dissatisfaction experienced by the senior staff, and the fresh university graduates should not be blamed for it.
4. **They quit their jobs easily.**
    - *State other’s stance*:
      Some people in the workplace may also claim that fresh university graduates in Hong Kong quit their jobs easily.
    - *Politely address the other’s stance + Point of rebuttal*:
      At first glance, this may indicate that they are easily defeated by challenges, but this actually reveals that a more participative leadership is the ideal choice for leading the new employees.
    - *Explain the idea clearly*:
      Recently, there has been a piece of news about an employee of the 90s quitting his job within a few days as his employer scolded him, which has stirred a lot of controversy in our society. Some of the senior staff claim that the fresh university graduates are not willing to admit their own mistakes and lack the ability to overcome obstacles in the workplace. These people, however, overlook the fact that the young generation is seeking acceptance as equals from the other generations. In my own company, the employees and I have a weekly gathering during lunch, in which they can express views on their work and exchange ideas with one another. Through this type of leadership will the employees have an impression that they are treated equally and given valuable advice, instead of orders for their work. This can provide them with a sense of achievement when they overcome an obstacle as they have more decision-making power and a sense of empowerment.
    - *Point of conclusion*:
      From my personal experience, I believe that with an appropriate leadership style, the fresh university graduates actually have a strong willingness to face challenges.
5. **Conclusion**
    - *Summary*:
      As a young entrepreneur, I deeply understand what strengths the young generation is equipped with and what they are seeking.
    - *End in high spirits* (What others employees should do):
      It is hoped that other employees in the city can try to communicate more with their fresh employees, trusting the future pillars of our society.

# Sample 2

1. **Introduction**
    - **Reason for writing:**
      I am writing in response to the recent claim of myriads of Hong Kong fresh university graduates being less hardworking and willing to face challenges compared with their counterparts in the past.
    - **State your stance clearly:**
      It goes without saying that the socioeconomic situation of Hong Kong has changed drastically over the past few decades and the university graduates nowadays suffer tremendously with the intensifying competition in society. As far as I am concerned, the accusations against the graduates are groundless and they actually work tirelessly and relentlessly to overcome the thorny challenges every day.
2. **They are bold enough to step out of the comfort zone.**
    - **Topic sentence:**
      To commence with, there is ample evidence that the university graduates in this era are willing to face challenges.
    - **Background:**
      Back in the old days, university graduates were rare and they were often offered the opportunities to work as management personnel in some top-notch enterprises locally and internationally, for example the human resource managers of HSBC or analysts of JP Morgan. As these jobs were so lucrative, they clung on to their jobs and dared not challenge themselves by establishing their own businesses.
    - **Explain the idea clearly:**
      Nowadays, the number of university graduates has been skyrocketing, giving rise to keen competition in the job market. Some of those graduates who lose this hostile battle can only earn their living through the establishment of their own businesses. Read local newspapers and you will discover their novel ideas, say food trucks, production of handicrafts and operation of online selling platforms on ebay, Carousell and Taobao. For those who are less innovative, they have accepted employment offers from mainland China, where they have to face unfairness and discrimination.
    - **Point of conclusion:**
      In the face of the cutthroat competition in the labour market, many university graduates are bold enough to step out of their comfort zone, overcoming challenges in their own businesses and pursuing new opportunities in mainland China.
3. **They are eager to climb up the social ladder.**
    - **Topic sentence:**
      Regarding the claim that university graduates are less hardworking, I believe the critics have underestimated the graduates’ determination and persistence in changing their own destiny.
    - **Explain the idea clearly:**
      Due to the intense competition from local counterparts and influx of overseas talents caused by globalization, the difficulty of recruitment is plummeting. Hoping to maintain their competitiveness, many fresh university graduates further their studies for master or even doctoral degrees. As they have entered the workforce, they have no alternative but to complete their studies on a part-time basis. Obviously, this mode of studying often generate unbearable exhaustion and excruciating stress as they are bombarded by their superiors with immense workload at the same time. Take my cousin as an example. Pursuing the Doctor of Philosophy degree in Science, he has to work around the clock – arriving at his office before 9, hurrying to the University of Hong Kong at around 7 and working on his assignments and projects until midnight.
    - **Point of conclusion:**
      This hectic lifestyle suggests that those university graduates who are eager to climb up the social ladder are willing to work industriously.
4. **In reality, they are so hardworking that they have applied for several jobs.**
    - **Topic sentence:**
      Furthermore, some fresh undergraduates are so hardworking that they have applied for several part-time jobs in addition to their full-time employment.
    - **Explain the idea clearly:**
      Not only are these fresh graduates motivated to maintain their competitiveness, it is also their wish to improve their families’ quality of living by earning some extra money. The millennials do not have a smooth pathway of employment like their predecessors. Instead, most of the experience hardship when looking for job openings and end up earning salary which is not self-sustainable, let alone purchasing their own apartments and establishing their own families. Finding it difficult to make ends meet, many fresh graduates apply for all sorts of part-time jobs, such as being private tutors and cashiers as well as translating document. In exchange for a brighter future, they sacrifice their work-life balance and spare time which could have been spent on developing friendship and entertaining themselves.
    - **Point of conclusion:**
      How can we say that the fresh university graduates nowadays are not hardworking?
5. **Conclusion**
    - **Summary:**
      All in all, not only does such a claim show how ignorant some critics are, it also reveals how miserable the life of some university graduates is.
    - **End in high spirits (What others employees should do):**
      To provide them with work-life balance and change their destiny, collaborative effort from the government and employers is definitely required.
