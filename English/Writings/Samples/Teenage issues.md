# Essay / feature article: Suicide
The teenage dilemma

One more student committed suicide last week. This heartbreaking news has provoked everyone's attention to the challenges students face in Hong Kong. In fact, stress among local students has been prevalent. However, it raises the question of why students are experiencing such high levels of stress without having someone to turn to for support. To prevent further tragedies, it is crucial to understand the underlying causes of their duties and work towards establishing a support system for students in need.

One major cause of stress among teenagers is the immense academic pressure they face. Many students express concerns about their studies, as they perceive success in academics as a pathway to securing a well-paid job. A recent survey conducted by our school reveals that a majority of students suffer from insomnia due to tremendous academic stress. Additionally, parental expectations play a significant role, as parents often have high aspirations for their children's academic achievements. In Chinese culture, the emphasis on success, particularly in terms of promising careers, further adds fuels to the pressure felt by teenagers.

Emotional challenges also contribute to teenage stress. Peer pressure and the need for social approval can be overwhelming for teenagers. The influence of social media, where popularity is measured by likes and validation, adds to the emotional burden. It is not uncommon to see kids hurting themselves or even taking their own lives due to social media problems, namely, cyber-bullying or a low self-esteem. In addition, teenagers may feel the need to conceal their problems due to a generation gap that limits effective communication and understanding between them and their parents.

Despite the challenges faced by our helpless adolescents, there are a myraid of practical solutions to alleviate their academic and emotional problems. Let's delve into (how) our educators and parties involved can help save our poor teens form their predicament.

To alleviate academic stress, schools should consider implementing measures that promote a balanced learning environment. Firstly, reducing the amount of homework can help alleviate the burden on students, allowing them to have more time for relaxation and pursuing other interests. It is revealed in our recent survey that students find homework the major source of their stress. It is believe that reducing the amount of homework can relieve students' mental burden. Secondly, the introduction of e-learning platforms and technology-based teaching methods can enhance the efficiency of learning, providing students with more interactive and personalized educational experiences. With the introduction of i-Pad learning and our "e-ask" interactive AI answering machine in class, a lot of students who benefit from the innovative measures express that their efficacy of learning is greatly enhanced.

To tackle emotional problems, schools can initiate a "Happiness Campaign" aimed at promoting well-being among students. This campaign could include organizing relaxing day trips and entertainment activities within the school environment. Creating opportunities for students to engage in recreational and stress-reliving activities can help alleviate emotional stress and foster a positive school atmosphere. As "Anson Lo" and "Jeremy" from the sensational boyfriend Mirror are popular idols of our teenagers, they could be invited to cheer our depressed teenagers up. Additionally, schools can employ social workers or counsellors who are professional to provide practical help and support to students facing emotional challenges.

Teenage stress is a complex issue influence by academic pressure and emotional problems. By implementing a multi-faceted approach, schools can play a vital role in alleviating stress among teenagers. Reducing academic workload and integrating technology in education can enhance the learning experience, while organizing happiness campaigns and providing professional support can address emotional challenges. It is of paramount importance to education all our future pillars of society that, "No one is immune to stress", but they should also (be) reminded that we are always here to show our unconditional love and unfailing support.

# Letter of proposal: Mental health
Dear Ms Chan,

I would like to begin by expressing my sincere gratitude for your exemplary leadership at Hong Kong College. Your commitment to fostering a nurturing and supportive environment for our students is truly commendable. However, the recent suicide attempt of our student from 5D has raised the concern of not only students but parents. Recent studies from MindHK reveal that Hong Kong faces one of the highest rates of depression and anxiety in the world, with nearly half of our youth experiencing symptoms of depression. In the face of this undesirable situation, I am writing to propose effective solutions to alleviate the anxiety and stress of our students.

**Rationale**
With a view to examining sources of stress and their impact on mental health, our Student Council has launched a survey targeting at senior form students. It is shocking that a significant number of students reported having suicidal (thoughts) due to overwhelming academic stress, which highlighted the severity of the mental health challenges faced by students. Nearly 30% of students reported experiencing symptoms of depression, and 25% of students reported symptoms of anxiety. This situation underscores the urgent need for immediate intervention and support.

Additionally, our findings reveal a dramatic decline in happiness levels among students, dropping from an average of 7 to 5 in the scale of 10. This decline highlights that academic pressure exert emotional toll on our students. As for the reasons behind their stress, approximately 80% reported that they were snowed under academic work in school. In light of these alarming figures, it is imperative that we launch a comprehensive mental health campaign to provide the necessary resources and support for our students' well-being.

To cope with the situation, a campaign and a measure will be proposed. The solutions are devised based on our research and survey results targeting at what students need.

**Mental Health and Wellbeing Campaign**
A comprehensive mental health and well-being campaign on campus is advised to be launched in a bid to help students relax and prioritize self-care. One key component would be the implementation of stress-reliving workshops and classes. Coaches from MindHK, a non-governmental youth organization that focuses on youth mental health, would be invited to guide students in meditation practices and art therapy workshops. Not only are the coaches popular among a lot of local secondary schools, but the program is also free. It is hoped that these activities will provide students with healthy coping mechanisms and outlets for managing the intense pressures they face when tackling the public examination. Additionally, it is proposed that the school should invite Anson Lo and Keung To, popular idols of students in our school, to perform. It has been revealed in the recent survey that a majority of students wish to meet their idols in person. It is believed that their presence and encourage would create endless happiness for students.

**Reducing Academic Workload**
As previously mentioned, students are overwhelmed by the volume of homework, projects and tests they are expected to complete each week. Therefore, it is hoped that the school should adopt a multi-faceted approach to reduce the immense academic workload. The panels in the school should critically examine their curriculum to ensure students are not overburdened by mandatory coursework. It should be specified that most S.4 and S.5 students express discontentment with having 3 Chinese writings and 3 Mathematics Quiz a month. It is suggested that more time can be devoted to interactive and out-of-classroom learning, to not only alleviate the stress of students but also the pressure of teachers. Alongside the curriculum changes, rules should be established to limit the maximum amount of homework assigned per class and night to prevent students from pending excessive hours for completing assignments. Coordinating assessment and homework schedules could be effective in avoiding students having multiple tests and assignments due in the same week, distributing the workload more evenly.

**Conclusion**
These holistic efforts to introduce stress-relieving activities and reform the academic structures could adequately ameliorate students' stress while preserving academic standard. While I whole-heartedly appreciate your remarkable leadership and contribution to the school, I sincerely hope that you would welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal in grater detail with our team of student leaders. I am sure that we can address this mental health crisis hand-in-hand, and develop the best support system in town to further consolidate our school's reputation as "the most wonderful school" in Kowloon. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to your favourable reply.

Yours sincerely,
Chris Wong
