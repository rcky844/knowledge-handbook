Dear editor,

I am writing this letter regarding the recent news article “demising family”, which discussed the alarming phenomenon that family members are drifting apart from each other, and I could not agree more. Hence, I would like to shed light on the rationale behind and suggest a solution that helps restore family harmony.

To start with, I believe it is the addiction to technological gadgets that makes family members start to be indifferent to one another. Back in the old good days were the parents and children gathering in front of the television to enjoy the show together, sharing daily trivialities with one another while binge-watching different soap dramas. However, with the advent of smartphones, all these have flown out of the window. With the compact boxes in hands, as opposed to watching TV shows together in sofa, they now view their favorite YouTube videos in their own locked rooms, depriving them of the chance to communicate. What piles on the gloom is that nowadays adolescents are so obsessed with the internet that they share things online instead of talking to their parents. Be it the misfortune they encounter or the little grace they receive, teenagers tend to post it on social media like Facebook and Instagram rather than sharing the news with their parents, killing the last opportunity to have a conversation. Gradually, an invisible wall is established between parents and children, making them stand aloof from one another.

Now that we know the problem originates from the addiction to technology, we can formulate a plan to counter it, with adding family hours and merging the individual virtual worlds into a communal social place being the first and foremost. Amid the family hours, family can watch their children’s favorite Netflix shows on TV. Sitting in a comfy sofa shoulder by shoulder, sharing the same cup of popcorns and laughing together at the plot can create a sense of intimacy. Better still, the show grants them a common topic to elaborate on, comments on the actors’ appearance and discussion on the plots can be easily induced, creating room for interactions. Apart from watching Netflix and chill, family can play games like Supermario Party or Just Dance. Through playing these interactive games, a lot of laughter can be sparked. All these shared gaming experience will further pull the family members closer.

All in all, technology is our best friend and our worst enemy concurrently. It is a sharp knife that cuts the connection, fragmenting the family, but it is also the bridge that joins the isolated islands together into an integral family, holding them together firmer than ever. It is high time we utilized technology wisely to savor the family relationship before it goes beyond remedy, instead of allowing technology to erode our family bonds. It is hoped that the lamentable manifestation of shattering family can soon be erased.

Yours faithfully,
Chris Wong
