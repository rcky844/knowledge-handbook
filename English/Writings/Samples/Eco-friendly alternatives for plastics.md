# Letter to the Editor: ban on single-use plastics
Dear Editor,

The recent ban on single-use plastics in Hong Kong has sparked a heated debate among residents and the *catering industry*. Topics like "Soggy paper utensils" and "unusable paper straws" often hit the *headlines*. As the city grapples with the challenges of sustainability, this abrupt policy shift has raised significant concerns regarding its practicality and impact on daily life. While the intention to reduce plastic waste is commendable, the practice appears to *overlook* the *realities* faced by many citizens. Thus, I am writing to express my views on why this policy is undesirable and unfavorable to the city as a whole.

To commence with, the policy has <span class="hi-blue">brought immense inconvenience to city dwellers</span>. Many news reports and interview articles indicate that a considerable majority of takeaway customers find the new regulations highly inconvenient. Many have expressed frustration with the paper utensils provided by major chains, such as McDonald's, which tend to be *unwieldy pronounced* for construction workers and other laborers who rely heavily on lunch boxes, as the lack of adequate utensils <span class="hi-green">creates substantial obstacles for city dwellers seeking quick meal solutions</span> during their busy workdays, not to mention students who have to rush through their lunch hours. It is undeniable the drawbacks of the policies outweigh the benefits.

Moreover, this policy <span class="hi-blue">places an unfair financial burden on low-income groups</span>. To align with the new regulations, eateries are likely to pass on the increased costs associated with eco-friendly alternatives to consumers. For those already *struggling to make ends meet*, the additional expense of purchasing disposable wooden or paper utensils can surge quickly. A recent survey published by South China Morning Post reveals that a majority of blue collars like construction workers *reckon* that the $2 charges imposed on plastic utensils pose a daily financial burden to them. This shift not only <span class="hi-green">widens the wealth gap</span> but also <span class="hi-green">add fuels to the challenges</span> confronted by many low-income groups. It is crucial that we consider the financial realities of all Hongkongers, particularly those who work tirelessly to provide for their families.

While some proponents of the ban may argue that it is a step toward a more environmentally friendly future, there are <u>more effective alternatives that could be pursued without imposing undue hardship on residents</u>. For instance, <span class="hi-green">promoting</span> the use of reusable bag and utensils could be a viable compromise, allowing individuals to make sustainable choices without the inconveniences associated with paper *cutlery*. To achieve this, it is suggested the government sends a box of free utensils to every household to encourage the use of reusable cutlery. Also, reusable bags can be provided in the first stage of eco-friendly campaign, incentivizing citizens to adopt a green lifestyle. While being eco-friendly is an integral part of modern citizens, <span class="hi-blue">it should never come at the cost of placing burden on low-income groups</span>. It is essential that any environmental initiative we undertake is equitable and practical, ensuring that it serves the needs of all citizens rather than creating new barriers.

In conclusion, while the intention behind the ban on single-use plastics is *commendable*, its implementation <u>requires careful reconsideration</u>. We must <span class="hi-green">prioritize the convenience and financial well-being</span> of Hongkongers, seeking solutions that <span class="hi-green">genuinely foster sustainability without compromising daily life</span>. I urge our policymakers to engage with community and explore alternatives that balance ecological responsibility with practical needs. In short, it is of paramount importance to lead (the) eco-friendly trend, but the well-being of our Hong Kong citizens should be *at the top of agenda*.

Yours faithfully,
Chris Wong
