Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on whether the study of art should be made a compulsory subject in reference to a comment on the knowledge of art in the Hong Kong Post. I believe there is not an express need to create a compulsory subject for arts from Secondary 1 to 6.

First, knowledge of art is already embedded in the curriculum. If a separate subject compulsory to secondary education is created, it may create an information overload in students. Currently, students are already complaining a lack of time for studying because of the intensive nature of Hong Kong schools. Surveys conducted by the Student Mental Health Support Group found that over half of the secondary students have trouble catching up with the cumbersome syllabus. Making the study of art another compulsory subject would add insult to injury, and may cause students to reject arts entirely. Instead, continuing with the current means to handle arts in creation, appreciation and history through life education lessons or in language subjects could improve the students eagerness to learn about the various aspects of arts. Students can also focus on other leisure activities during their free time, which can include playing musical instruments and painting.

Second, studying arts is not feasible under a ranked-based education system. Unfortunately, arts require creativity and critical thinking that cannot be trained easily when there is stress to obtain better results in examinations. In Hong Kong, students are already forced to face the dilemma that studying is more for results rather than the knowledge it provides to the individual. They are hyper-focused on achieving good results, so they can land a good position in university. If arts education is implemented in such a system where students are ranked by their artwork or knowledge of historical events in arts, art appreciation cannot be truly established because rampant memorization will be employed. Instead, teachers and parents have a role to expose their child to arts at an early age through daily life. This forms a foundational framework in their minds and allow the proper development of important qualities in life.

However, some critics may point out that arts education is currently insufficient in the current education system. While this might be the case, this is not an excuse to create a subject solely for studying arts. Apart from being essential in life, arts is also an important part of our culture. Allowing students to stumble their way through the ocean of artwork left behind by those that came before them creates a stronger sense of pride when compared to spoon-feeding them with information in a long and dry environment at school.

In conclusion, studying arts should not be made a compulsory subject as it can further the burden of studying, resulting in less interest in arts. More importantly, having the study of arts as a subject devalues the content of art itself, as improper techniques will be used to interpret art. We should promote arts through challenging competitions and interactive workshops to establish a stronger understanding for students alike.

Yours faithfully,
Chris Wong
