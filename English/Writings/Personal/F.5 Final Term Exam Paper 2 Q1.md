### About Moonlight Coffee - recent developments and future challenges
At Moonlight Coffee, we aim to be the industry leader for eco-friendly and customer friendly coffee shops. Recently, we have been awarded the ISO 9001 and FSD certificates, further cementing our focus as a well-organized green organization. Many media companies flocked to our locations and the number of customers increased drastically. This is why we are actively hiring new employees to meet our demands for providing high quality customer service for all. We need you to join our growing family.

Looking forward, as our name is heard by more and more megacorporations, we are bound to face bottlenecks and fierce competition. Last year, we have decided to go carbon neutral by introducing the "greenifying" scheme where all of our practices would be monitored under an eco-friendly standard. Owing to the lack of a real competitor to fresh roasted coffee, which cuts costs and is greener than the traditional packaged coffee bags that most shops use, the business invested heavily in this area and social media advertising to promote our causes. We believe this is central to fending off any future challenges as the reception for our more is universally positive. Because of this, our staff members are especially proud at what they are able to produce. Their smiles are better than all our competitors!
