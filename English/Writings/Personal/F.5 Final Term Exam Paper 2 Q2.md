Hiding in the cracks: The homelessness problem

In this entry of the School Council blog, we will be zooming into homelessness. Unfortunately, the issue of homelessness is not often in the public eye, as we may consider homeless people unproductive or simply lazy. We may also carry the belief that they are all scammers begging on the streets. However, if you have ever walked pass a nearby street of our school, you may find these stereotypes to be untrue.

Nearby where our school campus sits lies a hideout spot for homeless people. In earlier years, most of them would be seen around the area, begging for a coin or a penny. Nowadays, the trend has significantly decreased after a strict crackdown imposed by the District Councils and police force. They are often seen hiding in tricky to reach spots, like under overpasses or cramped corridors between buildings. As I approached one of these settlements, a hygiene problem was apparent. I saw groups of mice walking by in raw daylight, and cockroaches were common sightings near their living areas. What's worse was an abundance of families who emit a very terrible smell, almost like decomposing corpses.

Although Hong Kong is a flourishing society, the homelessness problem is right there in our eyes. We may pass through nests of homeless wanderers and apply our tinted lenses, passing them off as though they are worthless and generally baddies. I even spotted a few passing by running through this section as quickly as possible, trying to avoid the smell. However, no matter how fast Hong Kong moves forward, the homelessness problem would not disappear overnight. It is irritating and infuriating that not only Hongkongers, but the government has done very little in solving the issue.

Then, a spectacular sight caught my eye. Several policemen approached these homeless people and forced them out of their homes. Following them were a few nicely dressed people with badges for property development agencies. I heard the rumble of the policemen confiscating their property, and the faces of saddened people walking away. Even though somebody just lost a home, it seemed as if the city continued to move forward as usual, without any hint of care for whoever was involved. Those passing by didn't bother to look away from their phones as FSD workers cleaned up the site.

This scene was especially saddening for me, as people are supposed to be living in cozy homes. To think that they had been kicked out of their places for resting was heart-breaking, not because the Hong Kong government should have plenty of resources to tackle these problems, but also the complete ignorance and the attitude of everyone in our society. In this fast-paced society, people seem to have forgotten the stories of these homeless people. But, who would want to report on the bad part of a society, when the annual budget can be spent on developing tourism and museums that all those homeless can never experience?

Instead of sitting back and watching the situation worsen, we as a school can do a lot more to help these homeless people. With volunteering strongly encouraged by the Education Bureau under the New Secondary Syllabus, we should all take part in these events and distribute food to the homeless, and hear their stories. We should also take part in painting or essay competitions to write about their heart-breaking stories, as spreading the word is the only way we could have our voice heard by government officials. We may also take part in activism. For example, students can start a campaign to collect signatures in advocating for better humanitarian and aid polices for the homeless. Together, we can make all the difference.

Hopefully, this blog entry can paint a picture of the current situation experience by the homeless population, and encourage you to support activities to help those in need.
