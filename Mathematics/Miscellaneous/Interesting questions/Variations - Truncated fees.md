For the first hour or less, the parking fee $\$C$ of a van in car park X is $\$A$. Thereafter, the fee $\$B$ varies directly as the paring time on a half-hourly basis. When a van is parked in car park for 3 hours, the parking fee is $\$68$. When a van is parked for 4 hours, the parking fee is $\$92$. Assume a van has been parked in car park X for $n$ hours where $n \geq 1$.

(a) (i) Express B in terms of $n$.
$$
\begin{align} \\
 & B = k(n-1),\,\,k\neq0 \\ \\
 & \text{Put}\,n=3,\,\,B=68-A,
 & 68-A=2k,\,\,2k+A=68 - (1) \\
 & \text{Put}\,n=4,\,\,B=92-A,
 & 92-A=3k,\,\,3k+A=92 - (2) \\
 & \text{By solving (1) and (2), we have}\,k=24,\,A=20 \\
 & \therefore B=24(n-1)
\end{align}
$$

(a) (ii) Express C in terms of $n$.
$$
\begin{align} \\
 & B = 24(n-1) \\
 & C = 24(n-1) + A = 24(n-1) + 20 = 24n-4
\end{align}
$$

(b) If a van has been parked in car park X for 10 hours, how much is the parking fee?
$$
\begin{align} \\
 & \text{When}\,n=10,\,\,C=24 \times 10 - 4 = 236 \\
 & \therefore \text{The parking fee is}\,\,\$236
\end{align}
$$

(c) For car park Y, the parking fee $\$F$ of a van varies directly as the parking time on a half-hourly basis. When a van is parked in car park Y for 6 hours, the parking fee is $120. Parking a van for more than how long would the parking fee by car park X be higher than that charged by car park Y.
$$
\begin{align} \\
 & F = kn,\,\,k\neq0 \\
 & \text{Put}\,n=6, F=120,
 & 6k=120,\,\,k=20 \\
 & \therefore F=20n \\ \\
 & 24n-4 > 20n,\,\,4n > 4,\,\,n>1 \\
 & \therefore \text{For more than 1 hour.}
\end{align}
$$
