## Styling

Knowledge Handbook aims to be a source of knowledge with minimal distractions. Therefore, careful
considerations ought to be taken in styling the content.

The general styling of content is lited below:
- Features:
    - "See also" italic tags are placed on the top most part of the page.
- Headings & sections:
    - Major sections use [ATX-style headings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html#atx-style-headings).
        - A H1 heading must be used before subsequent smaller headings.
        - The first keyword in the content of the section is highlighted with bold text.
    - Small sections use Italic text with a semi-colon at the end.
        - Headings of bullet or numbered list items should use bold text and be followed by a semi-colon.
- Content:
    - Bold or italic text is used for bullet points that summarize a part of the text.
    - Underlines or green coloured text is used for highlighting crucial sentences.
    - Blue coloured text is used for highlighting keywords.
    - Usage of other coloured texts should be minimal.
    - Callouts are used to present crucial information.
