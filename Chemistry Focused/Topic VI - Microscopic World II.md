## Definitions
[[Polarity of bonds and molecules]]:
- **Electronegativity**: Electronegativity is the ability of an atom of that element to <span class="hi-green">attract bond pair electrons</span> towards itself.
- **Bond polarity**: The <span class="hi-green">uneven distribution of electrons</span> creates polarity in a chemical bond.
- **Van der Waals' forces**: Van der Waals' forces is a weak intermolecular force existing between the partial negative pole of a molecule and the partial positive pole of another molecule.

[[Hydrogen bonds]]:
- Hydrogen bond is a strong intermolecular force existing between a <span class="hi-blue">hydrogen atom</span> bonded to highly electronegative atom (e.g. N / O / F) in a molecule and the <span class="hi-blue">lone pair electrons</span> from a highly electronegative atom (e.g. N / O / F) in another molecule.

# Important questions
## HKDSE 2022 Paper 1B Q4(d)
Explain the following increasing order of the boiling points of three compounds:
$$
\ce{BF3} < \ce{SF6} < \ce{H2O}
$$

**Answer**:
- Both molecules of $\ce{BF3}$ and $\ce{SF6}$ are held by weak <u>van der Waals' forces</u>.
- The <u>molecular size</u> of $\ce{SF6}$ is <u>larger</u> than that of $\ce{BF3}$, therefore the van der Waals' forces between $\ce{SF6}$ molecules are stronger than those between $\ce{BF3}$ molecules.
- Stronger hydrogen bonds exist between $\ce{H2O}$ *molecules*. (\*)

(Accept: $\ce{SF6}$ molecule has more electrons than $\ce{BF3}$ molecule;
Not accept: Molecules of $\ce{BF3}$ and $\ce{SF6}$ are held by intermolecular forces. / The molecular mass of $\ce{SF6}$ is larger than that of $\ce{BF3}$.)
