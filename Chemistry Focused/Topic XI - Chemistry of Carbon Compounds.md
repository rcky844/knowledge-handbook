# Concepts
*Refer to: [[Organic Chemistry]]*

## Definitions
*Reactions*:
- **Markovnikov's rule**: (HKDSE 2021 Paper 1B Q11(a))
  When a molecule of $\ce{HX}$ is added to an alkene, the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon atom of the carbon-carbon double bond that <u>already carries the larger number of hydrogen atoms</u>.

- **Elimination reaction**: In an elimination reaction, atoms or groups of atoms are <span class="hi-green">removed from two adjacent atoms</span> of the reactant molecule.

- **Condensation reaction** is a reaction in which two or more molecules are joined together to form a single product with the elimination of small molecules.

[[Isomerism]]:
- **Isomerism** refers to molecules with the <span class="hi-green">same molecular formula</span> but different structural or spatial arrangement of atoms within the molecules.
<br>
- **Structural isomers** are molecules with the same molecular formula but <span class="hi-green">different structural arrangement of atoms</span> within the molecules.
- **Chain isomers** are structural isomers that have the <span class="hi-green">same functional group</span> but <u>different carbon parent chain</u>.
- **Position isomers** are structural isomers that have the same carbon parent chain and functional group but <span class="hi-green">different position of the functional group</span>.
- **Functional group isomers** are structural isomers that have <span class="hi-green">different functional groups</span>.
<br>
- **Stereoisomers** are molecules with the same molecular formula but <span class="hi-green">different spatial arrangement of atoms</span> within the molecules.
- ***Cis-trans* isomers** are stereoisomers that have different spatial arrangements due to the <span class="hi-orange">restricted rotation of C=C bond</span>.
- **Enantiomers** are stereoisomers that have different spatial arrangements due to being <span class="hi-orange">non-superimposable to its mirror image</span>.
	- **Chirality** is the <u>ability</u> of substance to be non-superimposable to its mirror image.
	- **Chiral carbon** is a carbon atom attached to <u>four different atoms or groups of atoms</u>.
	- **Optical activity**: (HKDSE 2016 Paper 1B Q13(d))
	  Enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light to opposite directions to the same degree / extent.

[[Detergents]]:
- **Soapy detergents** are made from <span class="hi-blue">saponification</span> (alkaline hydrolysis) by using <u>natural fats and oils</u>.
- **Soapless detergents** are made from chemicals derived from <u>petroleum</u>.
- **Emulsifying property**: The ability of a substance to <span class="hi-green">dispersing one liquid</span> <u>in a second immiscible liquid</u>.
- **Salting out of soap**: By adding concentrated sodium chloride solution into the reaction mixture after saponification to decrease the solubility of soap.

[[Condensation polymerization]]: (HKDSE 2021 Paper 1B Q13)
**Condensation polymerization** is a reaction in which <span class="hi-blue">monomers</span> are <u>joined together repeatedly</u> to form a <span class="hi-blue">polymer</span> molecule <span class="hi-orange">with elimination of small molecules</span>.
