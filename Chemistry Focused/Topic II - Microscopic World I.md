*Refer to: [[Structures and Patterns in Chemicals#Microscopic World I]]*

## Definitions
[[Elements and their classifications]]:
- **Metalloid / semi-metal**: A metalloid is a substance with some properties similar to those of metals and some to those of non-metals.

[[Atomic structure]]:
- **Atomic number**: Atomic number of an element is the <u>number of protons</u> in an atom of that element.
- **Mass number**: Mass number of an element is the (sum of) <u>number of protons and neutrons</u> in an atom of that element.
- **Isotopes**: Atoms of the same element but with different numbers of neutrons. (HKDSE 2021 Paper 1B Q3(a))

[[Relative isotopic mass and relative atomic mass]]:
- **Relative isotopic mass**: The relative isotopic mass of an isotope is the mass of the isotope <u>compared with 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom</u> (i.e. mass of a proton or mass of a neutron).
- **Relative atomic mass**: The relative atomic mass is the <u>weighted average relative isotopic mass of all natural occurring isotopes</u> of that element compared with 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom (i.e. mass of a proton or mass of a neutron).

[[Periodic Table]]:
- **Duplet structure**: Duplet structure is fulfilled when there are <span class="hi-green">2 electrons</span> in the outermost electron shell of an atom.
- **Octet structure**: Octet structure is fulfilled when there are <span class="hi-green">8 electrons</span> in the outermost electron shell of an atom.

*Chemical bonding*:
- [[Metallic bonds]]: Metallic bond is a strong <u>electrostatic force of attraction</u> between the <span class="hi-blue">metallic ions</span> and a 'sea' of <span class="hi-blue">delocalized electrons</span>.
- [[Ionic bonds]]: Ionic bond is a strong <u>electrostatic force of attraction</u> between <span class="hi-blue">oppositely charged ions</span>.
	- **Ionization**: Ionization is a chemical process in which an <span class="hi-green">atom gains or loses electrons</span> to become an ion with negative or positive charge.
- [[Covalent bonds]]: Covalent bond is a strong <u>electrostatic force of attraction</u> between the <span class="hi-blue">bond pair electrons</span> and the <span class="hi-blue">positively charged nuclei</span> of the bonded atoms.
	- **Dative covalent bond**: Dative covalent bond is a covalent bond where the <span class="hi-blue">bond pair electrons</span> are <span class="hi-green">provided / contributed by the same atom</span>.

*Chemical structures and relation between the properties of substances*:
- [[Giant metallic structure]]: Giant metallic structure is a <u>giant network</u> which consists of metal ions and a 'sea' of delocalized electrons held by <span class="hi-blue">metallic bond</span>.
- [[Giant covalent structure]]: Giant covalent structure is a <u>giant network</u> which consists of atoms linked to each other by <span class="hi-blue">covalent bond</span>.
	- **Allotropes**: Allotropes are two or more forms of the same element in which the atoms or the molecules are <span class="hi-green">arranged in different ways</span>.
- [[Giant ionic structure]]: Giant ionic structure is a <u>giant network</u> which consists of oppositely charged ions linked together by <span class="hi-blue">ionic bond</span> in a <span class="hi-green">lattice structure</span>.
- [[Simple molecular structure]]: Simple molecular structure consists of <span class="hi-blue">discrete molecules</span> being held together by <span class="hi-blue">intermolecular forces</span>.

# Important questions
## Drawing electron diagram
Draw the electron diagram of calcium oxide, *showing electrons in outermost shell only*.

**Answer**:
![[cao_electron_diagram.webp|250]]

> [!tip] Process of drawing electron diagrams
> 1. Confirm whether the question is asking for <u>full or only the outermost electron shell</u> to be shown.
> 2. Deduce the <u>chemical structure</u> of the substance: Covalent compound & Ionic compound.
> 
> The outermost electron shell of cations can be omitted because all electrons in this shell is lost.

## HKDSE 2017 Paper 1B Q1(b)(i)
*See also: [[Collection of gases]]*

State the reason why the gas ($\ce{NH3(g)}$) CANNOT be collected by the following method.
![[2017_q1b(i).webp|250]]

**Answer**:
- The gas (ammonia) is less dense than air.
(<span class="hi-green"><u>Should be answered in terms of density.</u></span>  Not accept: The gas is lighter than air.)
(Not accept incorrect description of gas such as ammonium, $\ce{NH4}$, $\ce{NH4+}$, $\ce{HCl}$, etc.)

## HKDSE 2017 Paper 1B Q3(c)
Describe the formation of dative covalent bond using $\ce{H3O+}$ as example.

**Answer**:
- The <u>O atom</u> in $\ce{H2O}$ has lone pairs of electrons.
- $\ce{H+}$ does not have electrons in its outermost shell.
- Dative covalent bond formed between the O atom in $\ce{H2O}$ and $\ce{H+}$ by sharing electron pair.

> [!tip] Dative covalent bond
> 1. Point out which atom has <span class="hi-blue">lone pair electrons</span>.
> 2. Point out which atom has a <span class="hi-blue">vacant site</span> in its outermost electron shell.
> 3. Describe the formation of dative covalent bond, e.g.:
>    $\ce{H+}$ can <span class="hi-green">attain a stable electron configuration</span> of a noble gas like helium.

## HKDSE 2018 Paper 1B Q3(a)
Explain whether $\ce{BaCl2}$ or $\ce{OCl2}$ would have a higher melting point.

**Answer**:
- The electrostatic attraction between $\ce{Ba2+}$ and $\ce{Cl-}$ in $\ce{BaCl2}$ is ionic bond while intermolecular attraction between $\ce{OCl2}$ molecules are van der Waals’ forces. / $\ce{BaCl2}$ is an ionic compound while $\ce{OCl2}$ has a simple molecular structure.
- As ionic bond is much stronger than van der Waals’ forces / intermolecular forces between $\ce{OCl2}$ molecules, $\ce{BaCl2}$ would have a higher melting point than $\ce{OCl2}$.
