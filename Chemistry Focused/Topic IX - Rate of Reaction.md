# Concepts
*Refer to: [[Rate of Reaction]]*

## Definitions
[[Types of rates of reaction]]:
- **Initial rate of reaction** is the <span class="hi-blue">instantaneous rate at t = 0</span> (the beginning of the reaction). (HKDSE 2022 Paper 2 Q1(c)(i))
- **Instantaneous rate of reaction** is the rate of reaction at a <u>particular moment of time</u>.
- **Average rate of reaction** is the rate of reaction at a <u>certain period of time</u> / from the beginning to the finished moment of reaction.

[[Following the progress of a reaction]]:
- **Quenching**: Quenching is to stop the reaction as much as possible.

[[Effective collisions]]: An effective collision is a collision between reactant which leads to a chemical reaction.
- **Activation energy**:
  'Activation energy' refers to the <u>minimum energy</u> possessed by the colliding reactant particles in order that a <u>reaction can occur</u>. / The <u>energy barrier</u> to overcome for <u>the reaction to occur</u>.
  (HKDSE 2014 Paper 2 (a)(i))

[[Factors affecting rate of reaction]]:
- **Catalyst** is a substance which changes the rate of reaction <u>without itself chemically changed after the reaction</u>.

[[Gas volume calculations]]:
- **Avogardo's Law** states that same number of moles of gas molecules at the same temperature and pressure contains the same volume of gas molecules.
