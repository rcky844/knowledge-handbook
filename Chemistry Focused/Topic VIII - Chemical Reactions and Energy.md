*Refer to: [[Chemical Reactions and Energy]]*

## Definitions
[[Endothermic and exothermic reactions]]:
- An **endothermic reaction** absorbs heat from the surrounding to the system.
- An **exothermic reaction** releases heat from the system to the surrounding.

[[Enthalpy change]]:
- **Enthalpy change** is the heat change at <span class="hi-green">constant pressure</span>.
  (HKDSE 2016 Paper 1B Q7(a))
- **Standard enthalpy change** is the heat change at <span class="hi-green">constant pressure with 1 atm and 296K</span>. (HKDSE 2017 Paper 1B Q7(c)(i))
- *Types of enthalpy change*:
	- **Enthalpy change of neutralization** is the enthalpy change when an acid solution and a base / alkali solution react together / neutralize under constant pressure (/ standard conditions) to <span class="hi-green">produce 1 mole of water</span>.
	- **Enthalpy change of combustion** is the enthalpy change when <span class="hi-green">1 mole of substance is <u>completely combusted</u> in oxygen</span> under constant pressure (/ standard conditions).
	- **Enthalpy change of formation** is the enthalpy change when <span class="hi-green">1 mole of substance is formed from its <u>constituent elements</u></span> under constant pressure.
	- **Enthalpy change of reaction** is the enthalpy change when the reactants react according to the molar quantity stated in a specific equation under constant pressure (/ standard conditions).

[[Hess's law]]:
- The total enthalpy change of a chemical reaction is <span class="hi-green">independent of the pathway</span> between the initial and final states. (HKDSE 2017 Paper 1B Q7(b))
