# Concepts
*Refer to: [[Redox Reactions, Chemical Cells and Electrolysis]]*

## Definitions
[[Oxidation and reduction]]:
- **Reduction**: A reduction reaction occurs when a chemical species gains electrons / hydrogen / loses oxygen / has a decrease in oxidation number.
- **Oxidation**: An oxidation reaction occurs when a chemical species loses electrons / hydrogen / gains oxygen / has an increase in oxidation number.

[[Disproportionation reaction]]:
- **Disproportionation reaction** occurs when a chemical species is <span class="hi-green">oxidized and reduced simultaneously</span>.

[[Chemical cells in daily life]]:
- **Primary cell**: A cell that <u>cannot be recharged</u> / is non-rechargeable. (HKDSE 2022 Paper 1B Q5(a))
- **Secondary cell**: A secondary cell is a <u>rechargeable cell</u>.
- **Dry cell**: A dry cell uses a <span class="hi-blue">smoist paste</span> as electrolyte.
- **Wet cell**: A wet cell uses a <span class="hi-blue">solution</span> as electrolyte.

[[Chemical cells]] / [[Electrolysis]]:
- **Chemical cell**: A chemical cell converts <span class="hi-green">chemical energy to electrical energy</span> by <span class="hi-blue">spontaneous</span> redox reactions.
- **Electrolytic cell**: An electrolytic cell converts <span class="hi-green">electrical energy to chemical energy</span> by <u>applying electricity</u> to force reactions to occur.
- **Cathode**: A cathode is an electrode where <span class="hi-blue">reduction</span> takes place.
- **Anode**: An anode is an electrode where <span class="hi-blue">oxidation</span> takes place.
- **Cathodic protection** prevents metal from corrosion by <span class="hi-green">making the metal act as the cathode</span> connected to a battery.
