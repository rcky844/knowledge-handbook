# Concepts
*Refer to: [[Chemical Equilibrium]]*

## Definitions
- **Dynamic equilibrium**: (HKDSE 2016 Paper 1B Q10(a))
  At dynamic equilibrium, the <span class="hi-green">rate of forward reaction is equal to the rate of backward reaction</span>, and <span class="hi-orange">not equals zero</span>. /
  At dynamic equilibrium, reactants are converted to products and products are converted to reactants at equal rate. No net change is observed.

- **Le Chatelier's principle** states that when the conditions of an equilibrium system are changed (disturbed), the <span class="hi-green">equilibrium position will shift to reduce the change</span>.
