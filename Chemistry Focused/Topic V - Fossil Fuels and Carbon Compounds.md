# Concepts
*Refer to: [[Organic Chemistry]]*

## Definitions
[[Hydrocarbons]]:
- **Petroleum** is formed when large quantities of dead <u>marine organism</u> (, such as planktons and algaes), that are buried underneath sedimentary rock and subjected to <u>intense heat</u> and <u>pressure</u> for a long time.
  (HKDSE 2018 Paper 1B Q4(a))

[[Homologous series and Functional groups]]:
- **Functional group**: A functional group is <u>an atom or a group of atoms</u> which <span class="hi-green">determines most of the properties of a compound</span>.
- **Homologous series** is a family of compounds having the same <span class="hi-blue">general formula and functional group</span> with adjacent members differing by a $\ce{-CH2-}$ unit.

[[Substitution reaction]] / [[Addition reaction]]:
- **Substitution reaction** is a reaction in which an atom or a group of atoms in an organic molecule is <span class="hi-green">replaced</span> by another atom or groups of atoms.
- **Addition reaction** is a reaction in which two or more molecules are <span class="hi-green">joined together</span> to form a single product <span class="hi-green">without the elimination of small molecules</span>.

[[Cracking]]:
- **Catalytic cracking** breaks down the large alkanes to <span class="hi-blue">smaller alkanes and alkenes</span> with the help of <span class="hi-blue">heat and catalyst</span> in the <span class="hi-green">absence of oxygen</span>.

[[Addition polymerization]]:
- **Addition polymerization** is a reaction in which <span class="hi-blue">monomer molecules</span> join together repeatedly to form polymer molecules, <span class="hi-green">without the elimination of small molecules</span>.
