# Concepts
*Refer to: [[Metals]]*

## Definitions
*Calculations*:
- **Mole** ($\pu{mol}$): One mole is the amount of a substance that contains the same number of particles as atoms in $\pu{12.0 g}$ of carbon-12.
- **Avogardo constant** ($\ce{L}$): The number of particles ($6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles) in $\pu{12.0 g}$ of carbon-12 (1 mole).
- **Molar mass** ($\pu{g mol-1}$): Molar mas is the mass of one mole of substance.
- **Empirical formula**: The empirical formula of a compound gives the <span class="hi-green">simplest whole number ratio</span> of atoms or ions present in the compound.

[[Corrosion of metals]] / [[Corrosion of aluminium]]:
- **Corrosion**: The deterioration of a metal due to its reaction with oxygen, moisture or other substances in the environment.
- **Aluminium anodization** is an electrolytic process which <u>increases the thickness of the oxide layer</u> on aluminium, thus to <span class="hi-green">increase corrosion resistance of aluminium</span>(, but does not increase the strength of aluminium).

[[Protection of metals]]:
- **Alloy**: An alloy is a mixture formed by meting <span class="hi-green">two or more elements</span> together, in which <span class="hi-green">at least one of them is a metal</span>.

## Processes & Designs
### Chemistry of rusting
*Refer to: [[Rusting#Chemistry of rusting]]*

*Overall chemical equation*:
$\ce{4Fe (s) + 3O2 (g) + 2nH2O (ℓ) -> 2Fe2O3 . nH2O (s)}$

*Reaction of iron*:
Iron undergoes oxidation and loses electrons:
$\ce{Fe (s) -> Fe^2+ (aq) + 2e-}$
$\ce{Fe^2+ (aq) -> Fe^3+ (aq) + e-}$

*Reaction of oxygen and water*:
Oxygen and water gain electrons to become hydroxide ion.
$\ce{O2 (g) + 2H2O (ℓ) + 4e- -> 4OH- (aq)}$

### Rust indicator
**Rust indicator** is an aqueous solution potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) ($\ce{K3[Fe(CN)6]}$) and phenolphthalein.

When rusting occurs:
- <span class="hi-blue">Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III)</span> turns blue for $\ce{Fe^2+ (aq)}$.
- <span class="hi-blue">Phenolphthalein</span> turns pink for $\ce{OH- (aq)}$.

# Important questions
## HKCEE 1995 Paper 1 Q1(a)
Explain whether rubidium is more reactive than potassium.

**Answer**:
- Rb is more reactive than K because <u>Rb can release its (outermost shell) electrons</u> more readily than K. <span class="hi-green">(Not accept: Rb is lower than K in the Periodic Table.)</span>

## HKCEE 1999 Paper 1 Q2(a)
State ONE observable change and write a chemical equation for the reaction involved when dilute nitric acid is added to magnesium carbonate powder in a beaker.

**Answer**:
- Effervescence occurs / colourless gas bubble evolves / magnesium carbonate dissolves / heat evolves.
- $\ce{MgCO3(s) + 2HNO3(aq) -> Mg(NO3)2(aq) + H2O(ℓ) + CO2(g)}$ / $\ce{MgCO3(s) + 2H+(aq) -> Mg^{2+}(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(ℓ)}$
(Do NOT accept $\ce{2H+(aq) + CO3^2-(aq) -> CO2(g) + H2O(ℓ)}$)

> [!warning]
> - For "chemical equation", both full equations or ionic equations are accepted.
> - Do not write individual ions of a solid ionic compound (i.e. $\ce{CO3^{2-}(aq)}$), this is only applicable to aqueous ions.

## HKCEE 2000 Paper 1 Q9(i)
X, Y and Z are three different metals. The table below shows the results of two experiments carried out using the metals or their metal oxides.

| Experiment | X | Y | Z |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Adding the metal to water | Effervescence | No observable change | No observable change |
| Heating the metal oxide | No observable change | Metal produced | No observable change |

Based on the above information, arrange the three metals in order of increasing reactivity. Explain your answer.

**Answer**:
- Reactivity: Y < Z < X
- Y is the least reactive because <u>only the oxide of Y decomposes on heating</u> / <u>the oxides of X and Z are stable to heat</u>.
- X is the most reactive metal because <u>only X can react with water</u> / <u>Y and Z do not react with water</u>.

> [!warning]
> - The extraction of metal through direct heating is only possible for very oxides of unreactive metal.
> - Beware of the types of compounds being tested, either metal or metal oxide.

> [!tip] Comparing reactivity of metals
> 1. Deduce and explain the most / least reactive metal.
> 2. Compare the remaining species.
> 
> The explanation must mention the reactivity of metal / metal oxide (i.e. whether reaction occurred under specific conditions).

## HKDSE 2021 Paper 1B Q3(c)(ii)
Silicon dioxide is an oxide of silicon. Under certain conditions, $\pu{1.0 g}$ of $\ce{SiO2}$ is allowed to react with $\ce{1.0 g}$ of Mg. The equation for the reaction is shown below :

$$
\ce{SiO2 +2Mg -> 2MgO + Si}
$$

Calculate the theoretical mass of Si that can be formed.
(Relative atomic masses : O = 16.0, Mg = 24.3, Si = 28.1)

**Answer**:
- *Finding mole ratio of reactants*:
  No. of mole of $\ce{Mg}$ = 1.0 / 24.3 = 0.0412
  No. of mole of $\ce{SiO2}$ = 1.0 / 60.1 = 0.0166
  Mole ratio of $\ce{SiO2}$ to $\ce{Mg}$ is $1:2$

- *Point out limiting reagent / in excess* (\*)
  The no. of moles of Mg required to react completely with $\pu{1.0 g}$ $\ce{SiO2}$ is 0.0332. Therefore, Mg is in excess and 0.0166 mol of Si can be formed.
  
  (1 mark for correct deduction of Mg is in excess / $\ce{SiO2}$ is limiting. Showing the mole ratio $\ce{SiO2}:\ce{Mg}$ is $1:2$ is required)

- *Result (mass)*:
  The mass of Si can be formed = 28.1 x 0.0166 = 0.466 g
  (Correct unit is required) (Accept 0.466 - 0.48) (max. 4 significant figures)
