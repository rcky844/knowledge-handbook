## Definitions
[[Chemical and physical changes and properties]]:
- **Physical change**: A physical change is a change <u>without new substance formed</u>.
- **Chemical change**: A chemical change is a change <u>with new substance</u> formed.

[[Classification of matter]]:
- **Element**: An element is a substance which <u>cannot be broken down</u> into anything simply by <span class="hi-green">chemical methods</span>.
- **Compound**: A compound consists of two or more elements that are <span class="hi-green">chemically joined together</span>.
- **Mixture**: A mixture is a substance that consists of two or more substances which are <span class="hi-green">not chemically joined</span>.
- **Solution**: A solution is a <span class="hi-blue">mixture</span> that contains a <u>solvent dissolving a solute</u>.

[[Crystallization]]:
- **Concentrated solution**: A concentrated solution is a solution with a <span class="hi-green"><u>high amount</u></span> of <span class="hi-blue">solute</span> dissolved in the <span class="hi-blue">solvent</span>.
- **Saturated solution**: A saturated solution is a solution that has <u>dissolved all the solute</u> it can <span class="hi-green">at a given temperature</span>. (refer for *tests*)

## Processes & Designs
[[Fractional distillation of liquefied air]]:
- Nitrogen is vaporized and is collected at the top as gas.
- Argon is also vaporized but condenses at the centre and is collected as liquid.
- Liquid oxygen flow to the bottom and is collected.

*Separation of insoluble solid from a solution*:
- [[Decantation]]
- [[Filtration]]: Filter the solution, X is collected as <span class="hi-blue">filtrate</span>, while Y is collected as <span class="hi-blue">residue</span>.

*Obtaining soluble solid from a solution*:
- [[Evaporation]]: Heat the solution to evaporation the <span class="hi-blue">solvent</span> and obtain the <span class="hi-blue">solute</span>.
- [[Crystallization]]: Allow the hot <span class="hi-blue">saturated solution</span> to cool so that crystals start to form. <span class="hi-blue">Filter</span> to obtain the crystals (and collect as residue). Wash with <span class="hi-green">small amount of cold distilled water</span> and dry with filter paper.

[[Simple distillation]]:
- Solution is <span class="hi-green">heated up slowly</span>, and then the <span class="hi-blue">distillate</span> will be collected at the end of the condenser.
- The <span class="hi-blue">condenser</span> has flowing cold tap water that enters from the lower end to increase the effectiveness of cooling.
- The <span class="hi-blue">anti-bumping granules</span> is to ensure <span class="hi-green">even heating and prevents bumping</span> of sea water.

# Important questions
## HKDSE 2013 Paper 1B Q1(b)(i)
*See also: [[Simple distillation]]*

Outline the underlying <u>principle</u> of the simple distillation experiment (to distill water from sea water sample).

**Answer**:
- *Principle*: Water boils at about 100Â°C, but the salts in sea water are non-volatile.
- *Process*: The steam formed condenses on the cold surface of the condenser / cool down to give liquid water.

> [!tip] Principle or simple / fractional distillation
> - The principle is that the substances to be separated has <u>different boiling points</u>.
> - The process to achieve the aim has to be described. (i.e. water condenses on surface of condenser / salt retain in boiling flask due to its non-volatile nature / high boiling points)
